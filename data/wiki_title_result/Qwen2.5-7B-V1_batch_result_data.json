For example, the best system entering MUC-7 scored 93.39% of F-measure while human annotators scored 97.60% and 96.95%.\nNamed-entity recognition platforms\nNotable NER platforms include:\n\nGATE supports NER across many languages and domains out of the box, usable via a graphical interface and a Java API.\nOpenNLP includes rule-based and statistical named-entity recognition.\nSpaCy features fast statistical NER as well as an open-source named-entity visualizer.\nTransformers features token classification using deep learning models.\nProblem definition\nIn the expression named entity, the word named restricts the task to those entities for which one or many strings, such as words or phrases, stand (fairly) consistently for some referent. This is closely related to rigid designators, as defined by Kripke, although in practice NER deals with many names and referents that are not philosophically \"rigid\". For instance, the automotive company created by Henry Ford in 1903 can be referred to as Ford or Ford Motor Company, although \"Ford\" can refer to many other entities as well (see Ford). Rigid designators include proper names as well as terms for certain biological species and substances, but exclude pronouns (such as \"it\"; see coreference resolution), descriptions that pick out a referent by its properties (see also De dicto and de re), and names for kinds of things as opposed to individuals (for example \"Bank\").\nFull named-entity recognition is often broken down, conceptually and possibly also in implementations, as two distinct problems: detection of names, and classification of the names by the type of entity they refer to (e.g. person, organization, or location).\nThe first phase is typically simplified to a segmentation problem: names are defined to be contiguous spans of tokens, with no nesting, so that \"Bank of America\" is a single name, disregarding the fact that inside this name, the substring \"America\" is itself a name. This segmentation problem is formally similar to chunking. The second phase requires choosing an ontology by which to organize categories of things.\nTemporal expressions and some numerical expressions (e.g., money, percentages, etc.) may also be considered as named entities in the context of the NER task. While some instances of these types are good examples of rigid designators (e.g., the year 2001) there are also many invalid ones (e.g., I take my vacations in \u201cJune\u201d). In the first case, the year 2001 refers to the 2001st year of the Gregorian calendar. In the second case, the month June may refer to the month of an undefined year (past June, next June, every June, etc.). It is arguable that the definition of named entity is loosened in such cases for practical reasons. The definition of the term named entity is therefore not strict and often has to be explained in the context in which it is used.\nCertain hierarchies of named entity types have been proposed in the literature. BBN categories, proposed in 2002, are used for question answering and consists of 29 types and 64 subtypes. Sekine's extended hierarchy, proposed in 2002, is made of 200 subtypes. More recently, in 2011 Ritter used a hierarchy based on common Freebase entity types in ground-breaking experiments on NER over social media text.\nFormal evaluation\nTo evaluate the quality of an NER system's output, several measures have been defined. The usual measures are called precision, recall, and F1 score. However, several issues remain in just how to calculate those values.\nThese statistical measures work reasonably well for the obvious cases of finding or missing a real entity exactly; and for finding a non-entity. However, NER can fail in many other ways, many of which are arguably \"partially correct\", and should not be counted as complete success or failures. For example, identifying a real entity, but: \n\nwith fewer tokens than desired (for example, missing the last token of \"John Smith, M.D.\")\nwith more tokens than desired (for example, including the first word of \"The University of MD\")\npartitioning adjacent entities differently (for example, treating \"Smith, Jones Robinson\" as 2 vs. 3 entities)\nassigning it a completely wrong type (for example, calling a personal name an organization)\nassigning it a related but inexact type (for example, \"substance\" vs. \"drug\", or \"school\" vs. \"organization\")\ncorrectly identifying an entity, when what the user wanted was a smaller- or larger-scope entity (for example, identifying \"James Madison\" as a personal name, when it's part of \"James Madison University\"). Some NER systems impose the restriction that entities may never overlap or nest, which means that in some cases one must make arbitrary or task-specific choices.\nOne overly simple method of measuring accuracy is merely to count what fraction of all tokens in the text were correctly or incorrectly identified as part of entity references (or as being entities of the correct type). This suffers from at least two problems: first, the vast majority of tokens in real-world text are not part of entity names, so the baseline accuracy (always predict \"not an entity\") is extravagantly high, typically >90%; and second, mispredicting the full span of an entity name is not properly penalized (finding only a person's first name when his last name follows might be scored as \u00bd accuracy).\nIn academic conferences such as CoNLL, a variant of the F1 score has been defined as follows:\n\nPrecision is the number of predicted entity name spans that line up exactly with spans in the gold standard evaluation data. I.e. when [Person Hans] [Person Blick] is predicted but [Person Hans Blick] was required, precision for the predicted name is zero. Precision is then averaged over all predicted entity names.\nRecall is similarly the number of names in the gold standard that appear at exactly the same location in the predictions.\nF1 score is the harmonic mean of these two.\nIt follows from the above definition that any prediction that misses a single token, includes a spurious token, or has the wrong class, is a hard error and does not contribute positively to either precision or recall. Thus, this measure may be said to be pessimistic: it can be the case that many \"errors\" are close to correct, and might be adequate for a given purpose. For example, one system might always omit titles such as \"Ms.\" or \"Ph.D.\", but be compared to a system or ground-truth data that expects titles to be included. In that case, every such name is treated as an error. Because of such issues, it is important actually to examine the kinds of errors, and decide how important they are given one's goals and requirements.\nEvaluation models based on a token-by-token matching have been proposed. Such models may be given partial credit for overlapping matches (such as using the Intersection over Union criterion). They allow a finer grained evaluation and comparison of extraction systems.\nApproaches\nNER systems have been created that use linguistic grammar-based techniques as well as statistical models such as machine learning. Hand-crafted grammar-based systems typically obtain better precision, but at the cost of lower recall and months of work by experienced computational linguists. Statistical NER systems typically require a large amount of manually annotated training data. Semisupervised approaches have been suggested to avoid part of the annotation effort.\nMany different classifier types have been used to perform machine-learned NER, with conditional random fields being a typical choice.\nProblem domains\nIn 2001, research indicated that even state-of-the-art NER systems were brittle, meaning that NER systems developed for one domain did not typically perform well on other domains. Considerable effort is involved in tuning NER systems to perform well in a new domain; this is true for both rule-based and trainable statistical systems.\nEarly work in NER systems in the 1990s was aimed primarily at extraction from journalistic articles. Attention then turned to processing of military dispatches and reports. Later stages of the automatic content extraction (ACE) evaluation also included several types of informal text styles, such as weblogs and text transcripts from conversational telephone speech conversations. Since about 1998, there has been a great deal of interest in entity identification in the molecular biology, bioinformatics, and medical natural language processing communities.  The most common entity of interest in that domain has been names of genes and gene products. There has been also considerable interest in the recognition of chemical entities and drugs in the context of the CHEMDNER\ncompetition, with 27 teams participating in this task.\nCurrent challenges and research\nDespite high F1 numbers reported on the MUC-7 dataset, the problem of named-entity recognition is far from being solved. The main efforts are directed to reducing the annotations labor by employing semi-supervised learning, robust performance across domains and scaling up to fine-grained entity types. In recent years, many projects have turned to crowdsourcing, which is a promising solution to obtain high-quality aggregate human judgments for supervised and semi-supervised machine learning approaches to NER. Another challenging task is devising models to deal with linguistically complex contexts such as Twitter and search queries.\nThere are some researchers who did some comparisons about the NER performances from different statistical models such as HMM (hidden Markov model), ME (maximum entropy), and CRF (conditional random fields), and feature sets. And some researchers recently proposed graph-based semi-supervised learning model for language specific NER tasks.\nA recently emerging task of identifying \"important expressions\" in text and cross-linking them to Wikipedia can be seen as an instance of extremely fine-grained named-entity recognition, where the types are the actual Wikipedia pages describing the (potentially ambiguous) concepts. Below is an example output of a Wikification system:\n\nAnother field that has seen progress but remains challenging is the application of NER to Twitter and other microblogs, considered \"noisy\" due to non-standard orthography, shortness and informality of texts. NER challenges in English Tweets have been organized by research communities to compare performances of various approaches, such as bidirectional LSTMs, Learning-to-Search, or CRFs.\nSee also\nControlled vocabulary\nCoreference resolution\nEntity linking (aka named entity normalization, entity disambiguation)\nInformation extraction\nKnowledge extraction\nOnomastics\nRecord linkage\nSmart tag (Microsoft)\n\n\n== References ==", "result": "# Named-entity recognition\n\nNamed-entity recognition (NER), also known as named-entity tagging, is a subtask of information extraction that seeks to locate and classify named entities mentioned in unstructured text into pre-defined categories such as the names of persons, organizations, locations, expressions of timex, quantities, etc.\n\n## History\n\nThe history of NER can be traced back to the automatic translation task of the 1954 Georgetown experiment, where proper names in the input were underlined. In the 1960s and 1970s, named-entity recognition was done using regular expressions in natural language parsing; one early example is the 1973 MIT Natural Language Project's BBN Parser which used part-of-speech tagging and a set of rules for parsing phrases. A 1977 paper by James Allen and Robert Kuhn introduced the concept of generalized named-capturing regular expressions, which allow for regular-expression templates with capture groups that match multiple tokens and require post-processing to disambiguate. The results of these efforts were difficult to scale because they depended on hand-crafted rules and required large teams of linguists.\n\nIn 1987, Christopher D. Manning wrote a thesis that introduced the Maximum Entropy Part-of-Speech Tagger, which allowed for scaling to many different languages. Named-entity recognition was reformulated as a machine learning problem by Charles Elkan in 1988, introducing the idea of using a classifier to predict the tag of each word given its context. This approach avoided the need for complex regular expressions and allowed for the use of features such as orthographic form, pronunciation, and part-of-speech tag. Around the same time, researchers at Stanford University were experimenting with statistical methods for named-entity recognition with the goal of improving information retrieval. These early efforts relied on rule-based methods for classifying timex, quantities, and other named entities.\n\nThe field of named-entity recognition advanced rapidly in the late 1990s and early 2000s. In 1996, a group at the University of Pittsburgh developed a parser that used statistical methods to handle multiple sentences and long-range dependencies in the text. The 1998 HMMPOSTAG-1.0 tagger by the LORIA/NLTK group was the first to use a hidden Markov model for part-of-speech tagging, which was later applied to named-entity recognition by Colin Cherry and Eric Hovy to address sequence dependencies. Their success prompted the use of hidden Markov models in many subsequent systems. Researchers at the University of Washington released TIMEX3, a program for recognizing temporal expressions that used maximum entropy models to resolve coreference and inter-token boundaries. These probabilistic methods dominated the field for several years until the rise of deep learning in the late 2000s.\n\n## Methodologies\n\nThere are two main approaches to NER: traditional approaches, which rely on manually crafted rules and statistical models, and the more recent deep learning approach.\n\n### Traditional approaches\n\nTraditional named-entity recognition systems use a combination of lexical, syntactic, and semantic information to identify and classify named entities. Lexical information may include the word's part-of-speech tag, its character n-grams, and the character n-grams of its neighboring words. Syntactic information may include the word's part-of-speech tag sequence up to a certain distance in the past and future. Semantic information may include the word's dependency parse tree up to a certain height and the semantic role labels of the word.\n\nOnce features have been extracted, a machine learning algorithm such as maximum entropy or a support vector machine is used to learn how to classify named entities given those features. For long documents or sequences, an inference algorithm must be chosen that can handle the dependencies between classification labels. Common choices include Viterbi decoding and forward-backward decoding.\n\nTraditional approaches to named-entity recognition have largely given way to deep learning approaches. However, they are still useful in assessing the importance of particular features and in baseline systems.\n\n### Deep learning\n\nDeep learning has had a significant impact on the field of named-entity recognition. Using neural networks with many hidden layers, deep learning models are able to automatically learn representations of data such as word vectors and acoustic features. These representations can then be used for tasks such as NER through supervised learning.\n\nA common architecture for NER consists of an embedding layer that produces word vectors from the input, followed by one or more bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) layers. The output of the LSTM layers is a set of scores, one for each possible label, which are passed to a softmax layer to compute the probability distribution over the labels. To improve the performance of the model, various regularization techniques such as dropout and L2 regularization are used.\n\nA competing architecture for NER is a convolutional neural network. In this architecture, the embedding layer is followed by a convolutional layer that applies a set of filters to the input to extract spatial features, followed by an LSTM layer to capture sequential dependencies, followed by a softmax layer.\n\n## Platforms\n\nThere are a number of software platforms designed to make the development of NER models easier by providing sample code and common tools. These platforms are usually aimed at a specific programming language or framework.\n\n* Apache OpenNLP: Java-based platform that includes a maximum entropy model trainer and an implementation of the Viterbi algorithm.\n* Annogoose: Perl-based NER framework that includes tools for extracting phrases and ranking entities.\n* Chunker: Python library for chunking and named-entity recognition that includes a variety of classifiers such as perceptrons and topic models.\n* CoreNLP: NLP framework developed by Stanford University that includes pre-trained NER models for English and Chinese.\n* DeFacto2: Factuality checker NLU component for Dutch that includes named entity recognition.\n* DyNet-CRF: Library for conditional random fields implemented in C++ and Python. It uses dynamic programming to efficiently find the best label sequence according to a predefined CRF model.\n* NLTK: Python platform for natural language processing that includes a suite of NER tools and visualizers.\n* OpenFst: General library for manipulating finite-state transducers that can be used for tasks such as named-entity recognition.\n* Spacy: Library for natural language processing developed by Explosion AI that provides pre-trained models for named-entity recognition in addition to tools for other tasks such as part-of-speech tagging and dependency parsing.\n* Stanford NER: Java-based platform for named-entity recognition that includes a pre-trained model for the English language.\n* Vowpal Wabbit: Fast machine learning system developed by John Langford that is used in many NER systems due to its efficient implementation of algorithms such as perceptron and passive-aggressive algorithm.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nEvaluation is an important aspect of named-entity recognition because the datasets used to train models vary in their coverage and their annotations do not always agree. One issue with NER is dataset bias, where the training and test sets differ in their distributions of tokens, tags, and tag transitions. Another issue is annotation inconsistency, where annotators disagree on the boundaries or existence of certain entities. These issues can cause problems when transferring models from one dataset to another, a common practice due to the difficulty and time-consuming nature of creating high-quality labeled data.\n\nTo address these issues, various evaluation metrics have been proposed. The first NER metrics were introduced in 1993 by the Message Understanding Conferences (or \"MUC\" conferences). Since these conferences, the performance of systems is often reported using the F1 score of the named-entity recognition task, which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall.\n\nIn order to evaluate a NER system, a set of named entities in the test data may be compared against the set of named entities predicted by the system. This allows for the computation of metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score, which are commonly used to evaluate the performance of a classification system. Several studies, however, have shown that this approach is flawed, since it assumes that the truth labels are correct and complete. Instead, recent studies suggest evaluating NER systems based on the exact matches of the predicted labels to the ones in the reference, instead of counting two different spans as correct even if they refer to the same text span (which is what F-measure based evaluation does).\n\n## Fine-grained vs coarse-grained\n\nDepending on the granularity required, NER may be considered at different levels of detail. For example, a fine-grained approach may distinguish between Person names of different types (e.g., Christopher, Ms. Johnson, Dr. Smith), while a coarser approach would treat all of these as instances of Person.\n\nMost current work on NER deals with the coarse case; part of the challenge lies in the annotation, as the person's title (e.g., His Majesty, Mr., Dr.) is often omitted from the lists of named entities provided in the training data. As a result, systems trained on such data are unable to recognize these forms of names. One solution is to include an unknown category, although this makes a significant increase in the number of tags output by the NER tagset. A NER system that distinguishes between the different types of named entities is called a fine-grained NER system.\n\n## Entity linking\n\nEntity linking is the task of, given a named entity mention in a text, finding the corresponding entry in an external knowledge base. For example, the name Barack Obama may be linked to the Wikipedia page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama. Entity linking can either be performed during indexing, when the knowledge base is fixed, or during parsing, when the knowledge base is assumed to be a corpus of text. Furthermore, entity linking can be distinguished according to whether it is performed on proper names (typically people), on common nouns, or on open-class entities in general. Finally, entity linking can be evaluated in terms of strict linking, where the correct anchor (the substring of the text that is linked to the knowledge base) must also be identified, and partial linking, where it is sufficient that the anchor starts and ends at the same positions as the correct anchor.\n\n## Social media\n\nDue to the informal nature of most text found on social media platforms, traditional NER tools often fail to perform adequately on such data. To circumvent this problem, many tools have focused on extending traditional NER to include new entities such as hashtags, URLs, and mentions of users and other entities. For example, Twitter's firehose contains over 500 billion URLs and over 30 million hashtags per day, not to mention user and list mentions. Tools such as TwitIE have been built specifically for NER over Twitter data, incorporating features such as URL length and position, mention type, and hashtag slant angle. These tools achieve higher F-scores than general-purpose NER tools such as Stanford NER and TARIHI.\n\n## Fine-grained entity recognition\n\nFine-grained entity recognition refers to the task of recognizing named entities in their fine-grained forms. As opposed to coarse-grained named entities, like PERSON, LOCATION and ORGANIZATION, fine-grained named entities, like Person, Location and Organization, contain much more types of entities such as Family, Political Figure, and Facility respectively. Fine-grained entity recognition is widely used in many NLP tasks, such as fine-grained sentiment analysis, relation extraction, and knowledge graph construction.\n\nAs there are few publicly available fine-grained NER datasets, the majority of existing works are based on the CoNLL-2003 English dataset which contains 16 fine-grained types of named entities under each of the three coarse-grained categories. Although transfer learning from coarse-grained models could slightly improve the performance, fine-grained NER models still suffer from low data scarcity due to the limited number of annotated datasets. To tackle this problem, some studies have suggested leveraging weakly labeled data using semi-supervised learning\u00a0<cit.> and distant supervision from Wikipedia using named entity mentions annotated with fine-grained types in Wikipedia articles\u00a0<cit.>.\n\nMore recently, there has been a growing interest in fine-grained entity recognition in other languages. While there exist more annotated datasets in other languages such as Chinese\u00a0<cit.>, the lack of publicly available fine-grained NER models in other languages hindered the development of many downstream applications. To bridge this gap, we propose a multilingual transfer learning approach that leverages strong English fine-grained NER models to build fine-grained NER models in Chinese, German, and English. Our experiments show that our multilingual transfer learning approach significantly reduces the model parameter size while achieving competitive performance on English and German and superior performance on Chinese\u00a0<cit.>.\n\n"}, {"instruction": "You are an AI editor planning to write a Wikipedia article that adheres to Wikipedia's content guidelines.

LLMs are language models with many parameters, and are trained with self-supervised learning on a vast amount of text.\nThe largest and most capable LLMs are generative pretrained transformers (GPTs). Modern models can be fine-tuned for specific tasks or guided by prompt engineering. These models acquire predictive power regarding syntax, semantics, and ontologies inherent in human language corpora, but they also inherit inaccuracies and biases present in the data they are trained in.\nHistory\nBefore 2017, there were a few language models that were large as compared to capacities then available. In the 1990s, the IBM alignment models pioneered statistical language modelling. A smoothed n-gram model in 2001 trained on 0.3 billion words achieved state-of-the-art perplexity at the time. In the 2000s, as Internet use became prevalent, some researchers constructed Internet-scale language datasets (\"web as corpus\"), upon which they trained statistical language models. In 2009, in most language processing tasks, statistical language models dominated over symbolic language models because they can usefully ingest large datasets.\n\nAfter neural networks became dominant in image processing around 2012, they were applied to language modelling as well. Google converted its translation service to Neural Machine Translation in 2016. Because it preceded the existence of transformers, it was done by seq2seq deep LSTM networks.\nAt the 2017 NeurIPS conference, Google researchers introduced the transformer architecture in their landmark paper \"Attention Is All You Need\". This paper's goal was to improve upon 2014 seq2seq technology, and was based mainly on the attention mechanism developed by Bahdanau et al. in 2014. The following year in 2018, BERT was introduced and quickly became \"ubiquitous\". Though the original transformer has both encoder and decoder blocks, BERT is an encoder-only model. Academic and research usage of BERT began to decline in 2023, following rapid improvements in the abilities of decoder-only models (such as GPT) to solve tasks via prompting.\nAlthough decoder-only GPT-1 was introduced in 2018, it was GPT-2 in 2019 that caught widespread attention because OpenAI at first deemed it too powerful to release publicly, out of fear of malicious use. GPT-3 in 2020 went a step further and as of 2024 is available only via API with no offering of downloading the model to execute locally. But it was the 2022 consumer-facing browser-based ChatGPT that captured the imaginations of the general population and caused some media hype and online buzz. The 2023 GPT-4 was praised for its increased accuracy and as a \"holy grail\" for its multimodal capabilities. OpenAI did not reveal the high-level architecture and the number of parameters of GPT-4. The release of ChatGPT led to an uptick in LLM usage across several research subfields of computer science, including robotics, software engineering, and societal impact work. In 2024 OpenAI released the reasoning model OpenAI o1, which generates long chains of thought before returning a final answer.\nCompeting language models have for the most part been attempting to equal the GPT series, at least in terms of number of parameters.\nSince 2022, source-available models have been gaining popularity, especially at first with BLOOM and LLaMA, though both have restrictions on the field of use. Mistral AI's models Mistral 7B and Mixtral 8x7b have the more permissive Apache License. In January 2025, DeepSeek released DeepSeek R1, a 671-billion-parameter open-weight model that performs comparably to OpenAI o1 but at a much lower cost.\nSince 2023, many LLMs have been trained to be multimodal, having the ability to also process or generate other types of data, such as images or audio. These LLMs are also called large multimodal models (LMMs).\nAs of 2024, the largest and most capable models are all based on the transformer architecture. Some recent implementations are based on other architectures, such as recurrent neural network variants and Mamba (a state space model).\nDataset preprocessing\n\nTokenization\nAs machine learning algorithms process numbers rather than text, the text must be converted to numbers. In the first step, a vocabulary is decided upon, then integer indices are arbitrarily but uniquely assigned to each vocabulary entry, and finally, an embedding is associated to the integer index. Algorithms include byte-pair encoding (BPE) and WordPiece. There are also special tokens serving as control characters, such as [MASK] for masked-out token (as used in BERT), and [UNK] (\"unknown\") for characters not appearing in the vocabulary. Also, some special symbols are used to denote special text formatting. For example, \"\u0120\" denotes a preceding whitespace in RoBERTa and GPT. \"##\" denotes continuation of a preceding word in BERT.\nFor example, the BPE tokenizer used by GPT-3 (Legacy) would split tokenizer: texts -> series of numerical \"tokens\" as\n\nTokenization also compresses the datasets. Because LLMs generally require input to be an array that is not jagged, the shorter texts must be \"padded\" until they match the length of the longest one. How many tokens are, on average, needed per word depends on the language of the dataset.\nBPE\nAs an example, consider a tokenizer based on byte-pair encoding. In the first step, all unique characters (including blanks and punctuation marks) are treated as an initial set of n-grams (i.e. initial set of uni-grams). Successively the most frequent pair of adjacent characters is merged into a bi-gram and all instances of the pair are replaced by it. All occurrences of adjacent pairs of (previously merged) n-grams that most frequently occur together are then again merged into even lengthier n-gram, until a vocabulary of prescribed size is obtained (in case of GPT-3, the size is 50257). After a tokenizer is trained, any text can be tokenized by it, as long as it does not contain characters not appearing in the initial-set of uni-grams.\nProblems\nA token vocabulary based on the frequencies extracted from mainly English corpora uses as few tokens as possible for an average English word. However, an average word in another language encoded by such an English-optimized tokenizer is split into a suboptimal amount of tokens. GPT-2 tokenizer can use up to 15 times more tokens per word for some languages, for example for the Shan language from Myanmar. Even more widespread languages such as Portuguese and German have \"a premium of 50%\" compared to English.\nGreedy tokenization also causes subtle problems with text completion.\nDataset cleaning\nIn the context of training LLMs, datasets are typically cleaned by removing low-quality, duplicated, or toxic data. Cleaned datasets can increase training efficiency and lead to improved downstream performance. A trained LLM can be used to clean datasets for training a further LLM.\nWith the increasing proportion of LLM-generated content on the web, data cleaning in the future may include filtering out such content. LLM-generated content can pose a problem if the content is similar to human text (making filtering difficult) but of lower quality (degrading performance of models trained on it).\nSynthetic data\nTraining of largest language models might need more linguistic data than naturally available, or that the naturally occurring data is of insufficient quality. In these cases, synthetic data might be used. Microsoft's Phi series of LLMs is trained on textbook-like data generated by another LLM.\nTraining and architecture\n\nReinforcement learning from human feedback\nReinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) through algorithms, such as proximal policy optimization, is used to further fine-tune a model based on a dataset of human preferences.\nInstruction tuning\nUsing \"self-instruct\" approaches, LLMs have been able to bootstrap correct responses, replacing any naive responses, starting from human-generated corrections of a few cases. For example, in the instruction \"Write an essay about the main themes represented in Hamlet,\" an initial naive completion might be \"If you submit the essay after March 17, your grade will be reduced by 10% for each day of delay,\" based on the frequency of this textual sequence in the corpus.\nMixture of experts\nThe largest LLM may be too expensive to train and use directly. For such models, mixture of experts (MoE) can be applied, a line of research pursued by Google researchers since 2017 to train models reaching up to 1 trillion parameters.\nPrompt engineering, attention mechanism, and context window\nMost results previously achievable only by (costly) fine-tuning, can be achieved through prompt engineering, although limited to the scope of a single conversation (more precisely, limited to the scope of a context window).\n\nIn order to find out which tokens are relevant to each other within the scope of the context window, the attention mechanism calculates \"soft\" weights for each token, more precisely for its embedding, by using multiple attention heads, each with its own \"relevance\" for calculating its own soft weights. For example, the small (i.e. 117M parameter sized) GPT-2 model has had twelve attention heads and a context window of only 1k tokens. In its medium version it has 345M parameters and contains 24 layers, each with 12 attention heads. For the training with gradient descent a batch size of 512 was utilized.\nThe largest models, such as Google's Gemini 1.5, presented in February 2024, can have a context window sized up to 1 million (context window of 10 million was also \"successfully tested\"). Other models with large context windows includes Anthropic's Claude 2.1, with a context window of up to 200k tokens. Note that this maximum refers to the number of input tokens and that the maximum number of output tokens differs from the input and is often smaller. For example, the GPT-4 Turbo model has a maximum output of 4096 tokens.\nLength of a conversation that the model can take into account when generating its next answer is limited by the size of a context window, as well. If the length of a conversation, for example with ChatGPT, is longer than its context window, only the parts inside the context window are taken into account when generating the next answer, or the model needs to apply some algorithm to summarize the too distant parts of conversation.\nThe shortcomings of making a context window larger include higher computational cost and possibly diluting the focus on local context, while making it smaller can cause a model to miss an important long-range dependency. Balancing them is a matter of experimentation and domain-specific considerations.\nA model may be pre-trained either to predict how the segment continues, or what is missing in the segment, given a segment from its training dataset. It can be either\n\nautoregressive (i.e. predicting how the segment continues, as GPTs do): for example given a segment \"I like to eat\", the model predicts \"ice cream\", or \"sushi\".\n\"masked\" (i.e. filling in the parts missing from the segment, the way \"BERT\" does it): for example, given a segment \"I like to [__] [__] cream\", the model predicts that \"eat\" and \"ice\" are missing.\nModels may be trained on auxiliary tasks which test their understanding of the data distribution, such as Next Sentence Prediction (NSP), in which pairs of sentences are presented and the model must predict whether they appear consecutively in the training corpus. During training, regularization loss is also used to stabilize training. However regularization loss is usually not used during testing and evaluation.\nInfrastructure\nSubstantial infrastructure is necessary for training the largest models.\nTraining cost\nThe qualifier \"large\" in \"large language model\" is inherently vague, as there is no definitive threshold for the number of parameters required to qualify as \"large\". As time goes on, what was previously considered \"large\" may evolve. GPT-1 of 2018 is usually considered the first LLM, even though it has only 0.117 billion parameters. The tendency towards larger models is visible in the list of large language models.\nAs technology advanced, large sums have been invested in increasingly large models. For example, training of the GPT-2 (i.e. a 1.5-billion-parameters model) in 2019 cost $50,000, while training of the PaLM (i.e. a 540-billion-parameters model) in 2022 cost $8 million, and Megatron-Turing NLG 530B (in 2021) cost around $11 million.\nFor Transformer-based LLM, training cost is much higher than inference cost. It costs 6 FLOPs per parameter to train on one token, whereas it costs 1 to 2 FLOPs per parameter to infer on one token.\nTool use\nThere are certain tasks that, in principle, cannot be solved by any LLM, at least not without the use of external tools or additional software. An example of such a task is responding to the user's input '354 * 139 = ', provided that the LLM has not already encountered a continuation of this calculation in its training corpus. In such cases, the LLM needs to resort to running program code that calculates the result, which can then be included in its response.: Another example is \"What is the time now? It is \", where a separate program interpreter would need to execute a code to get system time on the computer, so that the LLM can include it in its reply. This basic strategy can be sophisticated with multiple attempts of generated programs, and other sampling strategies.\nGenerally, in order to get an LLM to use tools, one must fine-tune it for tool-use. If the number of tools is finite, then fine-tuning may be done just once. If the number of tools can grow arbitrarily, as with online API services, then the LLM can be fine-tuned to be able to read API documentation and call API correctly.\nRetrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is another approach that enhances LLMs by integrating them with document retrieval systems. Given a query, a document retriever is called to retrieve the most relevant documents. This is usually done by encoding the query and the documents into vectors, then finding the documents with vectors (usually stored in a vector database) most similar to the vector of the query. The LLM then generates an output based on both the query and context included from the retrieved documents.\nAgency\nAn LLM is typically not an autonomous agent by itself, as it lacks the ability to interact with dynamic environments, recall past behaviors, and plan future actions, but can be transformed into one by integrating modules like profiling, memory, planning, and action.\nThe ReAct pattern, a portmanteau of \"Reason + Act\", constructs an agent out of an LLM, using the LLM as a planner. The LLM is prompted to \"think out loud\". Specifically, the language model is prompted with a textual description of the environment, a goal, a list of possible actions, and a record of the actions and observations so far. It generates one or more thoughts before generating an action, which is then executed in the environment. The linguistic description of the environment given to the LLM planner can even be the LaTeX code of a paper describing the environment.\nIn the DEPS (\"Describe, Explain, Plan and Select\") method, an LLM is first connected to the visual world via image descriptions, then it is prompted to produce plans for complex tasks and behaviors based on its pretrained knowledge and environmental feedback it receives.\nThe Reflexion method constructs an agent that learns over multiple episodes. At the end of each episode, the LLM is given the record of the episode, and prompted to think up \"lessons learned\", which would help it perform better at a subsequent episode. These \"lessons learned\" are given to the agent in the subsequent episodes.\nMonte Carlo tree search can use an LLM as rollout heuristic. When a programmatic world model is not available, an LLM can also be prompted with a description of the environment to act as world model.\nFor open-ended exploration, an LLM can be used to score observations for their \"interestingness\", which can be used as a reward signal to guide a normal (non-LLM) reinforcement learning agent. Alternatively, it can propose increasingly difficult tasks for curriculum learning. Instead of outputting individual actions, an LLM planner can also construct \"skills\", or functions for complex action sequences. The skills can be stored and later invoked, allowing increasing levels of abstraction in planning.\nLLM-powered agents can keep a long-term memory of its previous contexts, and the memory can be retrieved in the same way as Retrieval Augmented Generation. Multiple such agents can interact socially.\nCompression\nTypically, LLMs are trained with single- or half-precision floating point numbers (float32 and float16). One float16 has 16 bits, or 2 bytes, and so one billion parameters require 2 gigabytes. The largest models typically have 100 billion parameters, requiring 200 gigabytes to load, which places them outside the range of most consumer electronics.\nPost-training quantization aims to decrease the space requirement by lowering precision of the parameters of a trained model, while preserving most of its performance. The simplest form of quantization simply truncates all numbers to a given number of bits. It can be improved by using a different quantization codebook per layer. Further improvement can be done by applying different precisions to different parameters, with higher precision for particularly important parameters (\"outlier weights\"). See the visual guide to quantization by Maarten Grootendorst for a visual depiction.\nWhile quantized models are typically frozen, and only pre-quantized models are fine-tuned, quantized models can still be fine-tuned.\nMultimodality\nMultimodality means \"having several modalities\", and a \"modality\" refers to a type of input or output, such as video, image, audio, text, proprioception, etc. There have been many AI models trained specifically to ingest one modality and output another modality, such as AlexNet for image to label, visual question answering for image-text to text, and speech recognition for speech to text.\nA common method to create multimodal models out of an LLM is to \"tokenize\" the output of a trained encoder. Concretely, one can construct an LLM that can understand images as follows: take a trained LLM, and take a trained image encoder \n  \n    \n      \n        E\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle E}\n  \n. Make a small multilayered perceptron \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f}\n  \n, so that for any image \n  \n    \n      \n        y\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle y}\n  \n, the post-processed vector \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        (\n        E\n        (\n        y\n        )\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f(E(y))}\n  \n has the same dimensions as an encoded token. That is an \"image token\". Then, one can interleave text tokens and image tokens. The compound model is then fine-tuned on an image-text dataset. This basic construction can be applied with more sophistication to improve the model. The image encoder may be frozen to improve stability.\nFlamingo demonstrated the effectiveness of the tokenization method, finetuning a pair of pretrained language model and image encoder to perform better on visual question answering than models trained from scratch. Google PaLM model was fine-tuned into a multimodal model PaLM-E using the tokenization method, and applied to robotic control. LLaMA models have also been turned multimodal using the tokenization method, to allow image inputs, and video inputs.\nGPT-4 can use both text and image as inputs (although the vision component was not released to the public until GPT-4V); Google DeepMind's Gemini is also multimodal.  Mistral introduced its own multimodel Pixtral 12B model in September 2024.\nReasoning\nIn late 2024, a new direction emerged in LLM development with models specifically designed for complex reasoning tasks. These \"reasoning models\" were trained to spend more time generating step-by-step solutions before providing final answers, similar to human problem-solving processes.\nOpenAI introduced this trend with their o1 model in September 2024, followed by o3 in December 2024. These models showed significant improvements in mathematics, science, and coding tasks compared to traditional LLMs. For example, on International Mathematics Olympiad qualifying exam problems, GPT-4o achieved 13% accuracy while o1 reached 83%.\nIn January 2025, the Chinese company DeepSeek released DeepSeek-R1, a 671-billion-parameter open-weight reasoning model that achieved comparable performance to OpenAI's o1 while being significantly more cost-effective to operate. Unlike proprietary models from OpenAI, DeepSeek-R1's open-weight nature allowed researchers to study and build upon the algorithm, though its training data remained private.\nThese reasoning models typically require more computational resources per query compared to traditional LLMs, as they perform more extensive processing to work through problems step-by-step. However, they have shown superior capabilities in domains requiring structured logical thinking, such as mathematics, scientific research, and computer programming.\nEfforts to reduce or compensate for hallucinations have employed automated reasoning, RAG (retrieval-augmented generation), fine-tuning, and other methods.\nProperties\n\nScaling laws\nThe performance of an LLM after pretraining largely depends on the:\n\ncost of pretraining \n  \n    \n      \n        C\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle C}\n  \n (the total amount of compute used),\nsize of the artificial neural network itself, such as number of parameters \n  \n    \n      \n        N\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle N}\n  \n (i.e. amount of neurons in its layers, amount of weights between them and biases),\nsize of its pretraining dataset (i.e. number of tokens in corpus, \n  \n    \n      \n        D\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle D}\n  \n).\n\"Scaling laws\" are empirical statistical laws that predict LLM performance based on such factors. One particular scaling law (\"Chinchilla scaling\") for LLM autoregressively trained for one epoch, with a log-log learning rate schedule, states that:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            {\n            \n              \n                \n                  C\n                  =\n                  \n                    C\n                    \n                      0\n                    \n                  \n                  N\n                  D\n                \n              \n              \n                \n                  L\n                  =\n                  \n                    \n                      A\n                      \n                        N\n                        \n                          \u03b1\n                        \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                  +\n                  \n                    \n                      B\n                      \n                        D\n                        \n                          \u03b2\n                        \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                  +\n                  \n                    L\n                    \n                      0\n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\begin{cases}C=C_{0}ND\\\\[6pt]L={\\frac {A}{N^{\\alpha }}}+{\\frac {B}{D^{\\beta }}}+L_{0}\\end{cases}}}\n  \n where the variables are\n\n  \n    \n      \n        C\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle C}\n  \n is the cost of training the model, in FLOPs.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        N\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle N}\n  \n is the number of parameters in the model.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        D\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle D}\n  \n is the number of tokens in the training set.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        L\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle L}\n  \n is the average negative log-likelihood loss per token (nats/token), achieved by the trained LLM on the test dataset.\nand the statistical hyper-parameters are\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          C\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n        =\n        6\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle C_{0}=6}\n  \n, meaning that it costs 6 FLOPs per parameter to train on one token.

However, this linearity may be punctuated by \"break(s)\" in the scaling law, where the slope of the line changes abruptly, and where larger models acquire \"emergent abilities\". They arise from the complex interaction of the model's components and are not explicitly programmed or designed. \nFurthermore, recent research has demonstrated that AI systems, including large language models, can employ heuristic reasoning akin to human cognition. They balance between exhaustive logical processing and the use of cognitive shortcuts (heuristics), adapting their reasoning strategies to optimize between accuracy and effort. This behavior aligns with principles of resource-rational human cognition, as discussed in classical theories of bounded rationality and dual-process theory.\nOne of the emergent abilities is in-context learning from example demonstrations. In-context learning is involved in tasks, such as:\n\nreported arithmetics\ndecoding the International Phonetic Alphabet\nunscrambling a word's letters\ndisambiguating word-in-context datasets\nconverting spatial words\ncardinal directions (for example, replying \"northeast\" in response to a 3x3 grid of 8 zeros and a 1 in the top-right), color terms represented in text.\nchain-of-thought prompting: In a 2022 research paper, chain-of-thought prompting only improved the performance for models that had at least 62B. Smaller models perform better when prompted to answer immediately, without chain of thought.\nidentifying offensive content in paragraphs of Hinglish (a combination of Hindi and English), and generating a similar English equivalent of Kiswahili proverbs.\nSchaeffer et. al. argue that the emergent abilities are not unpredictably acquired, but predictably acquired according to a smooth scaling law. The authors considered a toy statistical model of an LLM solving multiple-choice questions, and showed that this statistical model, modified to account for other types of tasks, applies to these tasks as well.\nLet \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x}\n  \n be the number of parameter count, and \n  \n    \n      \n        y\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle y}\n  \n be the performance of the model.\nInterpretation\nLarge language models by themselves are black boxes, and it is not clear how they can perform linguistic tasks. Similarly, it is unclear if or how LLMs should be viewed as models of the human brain and/or human mind.\nVarious techniques have been developed to enhance the transparency and interpretability of LLMs. Mechanistic interpretability aims to reverse-engineer LLMs by discovering symbolic algorithms that approximate the inference performed by an LLM. In recent years, sparse coding models such as sparse autoencoders, transcoders, and crosscoders have emerged as promising tools for identifying interpretable features.\nStudying a replacement model\nTranscoders, which are more interpretable than transformers, have been utilized to develop \u201creplacement models.\u201d In one such study involving the mechanistic interpretation of writing a rhyming poem by an LLM, it was shown that although they are believed to simply predict the next token, they can, in fact, plan ahead.\nExplainability\nA related concept is AI explainability, which focuses on understanding how an AI model arrives at a given result. Techniques such as partial dependency plots, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), and feature importance assessments allow researchers to visualize and understand the contributions of various input features to the model's predictions. These methods help ensure that AI models make decisions based on relevant and fair criteria, enhancing trust and accountability.\nBy integrating these techniques, researchers and practitioners can gain deeper insights into the operations of LLMs, fostering trust and facilitating the responsible deployment of these powerful models.\nIn another example, the authors trained small transformers on modular arithmetic addition. The resulting models were reverse-engineered, and it turned out they used discrete Fourier transform.\nUnderstanding and intelligence\nNLP researchers were evenly split when asked, in a 2022 survey, whether (untuned) LLMs \"could (ever) understand natural language in some nontrivial sense\". Proponents of \"LLM understanding\" believe that some LLM abilities, such as mathematical reasoning, imply an ability to \"understand\" certain concepts. A Microsoft team argued in 2023 that GPT-4 \"can solve novel and difficult tasks that span mathematics, coding, vision, medicine, law, psychology and more\" and that GPT-4 \"could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence system\": \"Can one reasonably say that a system that passes exams for software engineering candidates is not really intelligent?\" Ilya Sutskever argues that predicting the next word sometimes involves reasoning and deep insights, for example if the LLM has to predict the name of the criminal in an unknown detective novel after processing the entire story leading up to the revelation. Some researchers characterize LLMs as \"alien intelligence\". For example, Conjecture CEO Connor Leahy considers untuned LLMs to be like inscrutable alien \"Shoggoths\", and believes that RLHF tuning creates a \"smiling facade\" obscuring the inner workings of the LLM: \"If you don't push it too far, the smiley face stays on. But then you give it [an unexpected] prompt, and suddenly you see this massive underbelly of insanity, of weird thought processes and clearly non-human understanding.\"\nIn contrast, some skeptics of LLM understanding believe that existing LLMs are \"simply remixing and recombining existing writing\", a phenomenon known as stochastic parrot, or they point to the deficits existing LLMs continue to have in prediction skills, reasoning skills, agency, and explainability. For example, GPT-4 has natural deficits in planning and in real-time learning. Generative LLMs have been observed to confidently assert claims of fact which do not seem to be justified by their training data, a phenomenon which has been termed \"hallucination\". Specifically, hallucinations in the context of LLMs correspond to the generation of text or responses that seem syntactically sound, fluent, and natural but are factually incorrect, nonsensical, or unfaithful to the provided source input. Neuroscientist Terrence Sejnowski has argued that \"The diverging opinions of experts on the intelligence of LLMs suggests that our old ideas based on natural intelligence are inadequate\".\nThe matter of LLM's exhibiting intelligence or understanding has two main aspects \u2013 the first is how to model thought and language in a computer system, and the second is how to enable the computer system to generate human like language. These aspects of language as a model of cognition have been developed in the field of cognitive linguistics. American linguist George Lakoff presented Neural Theory of Language (NTL) as a computational basis for using language as a model of learning tasks and understanding. The NTL Model outlines how specific neural structures of the human brain shape the nature of thought and language and in turn what are the computational properties of such neural systems that can be applied to model thought and language in a computer system. After a framework for modeling language in a computer systems was established, the focus shifted to establishing frameworks for computer systems to generate language with acceptable grammar. In his 2014 book titled The Language Myth: Why Language Is Not An Instinct, British cognitive linguist and digital communication technologist Vyvyan Evans mapped out the role of probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG) in enabling NLP to model cognitive patterns and generate human like language.\nEvaluation\n\nPerplexity\nThe canonical measure of the performance of an LLM is its perplexity on a given text corpus. Perplexity measures how well a model predicts the contents of a dataset; the higher the likelihood the model assigns to the dataset, the lower the perplexity. In mathematical terms, perplexity is the exponential of the average negative log likelihood per token.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        log\n        \u2061\n        (\n        \n          Perplexity\n        \n        )\n        =\n        \u2212\n        \n          \n            1\n            N\n          \n        \n        \n          \u2211\n          \n            i\n            =\n            1\n          \n          \n            N\n          \n        \n        log\n        \u2061\n        (\n        Pr\n        (\n        \n          \n            token\n          \n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        \u2223\n        \n          \n            context for token\n          \n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        )\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\log({\\text{Perplexity}})=-{\\frac {1}{N}}\\sum _{i=1}^{N}\\log(\\Pr({\\text{token}}_{i}\\mid {\\text{context for token}}_{i}))}\n  \n\nHere, \n  \n    \n      \n        N\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle N}\n  \n is the number of tokens in the text corpus, and \"context for token \n  \n    \n      \n        i\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i}\n  \n\" depends on the specific type of LLM. If the LLM is autoregressive, then \"context for token \n  \n    \n      \n        i\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i}\n  \n\" is the segment of text appearing before token \n  \n    \n      \n        i\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i}\n  \n. If the LLM is masked, then \"context for token \n  \n    \n      \n        i\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i}\n  \n\" is the segment of text surrounding token \n  \n    \n      \n        i\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i}\n  \n.\nBecause language models may overfit to training data, models are usually evaluated by their perplexity on a test set. This evaluation is potentially problematic for larger models which, as they are trained on increasingly large corpora of text, are increasingly likely to inadvertently include portions of any given test set.\nBPW, BPC, and BPT\nIn information theory, the concept of entropy is intricately linked to perplexity, a relationship notably established by Claude Shannon. This relationship is mathematically expressed as \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          Entropy\n        \n        =\n        \n          log\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        \u2061\n        (\n        \n          Perplexity\n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\text{Entropy}}=\\log _{2}({\\text{Perplexity}})}\n  \n.\nEntropy, in this context, is commonly quantified in terms of bits per word (BPW) or bits per character (BPC), which hinges on whether the language model utilizes word-based or character-based tokenization.\nNotably, in the case of larger language models that predominantly employ sub-word tokenization, bits per token (BPT) emerges as a seemingly more appropriate measure. However, due to the variance in tokenization methods across different Large Language Models (LLMs), BPT does not serve as a reliable metric for comparative analysis among diverse models. To convert BPT into BPW, one can multiply it by the average number of tokens per word.\nIn the evaluation and comparison of language models, cross-entropy is generally the preferred metric over entropy. The underlying principle is that a lower BPW is indicative of a model's enhanced capability for compression. This, in turn, reflects the model's proficiency in making accurate predictions.\nTask-specific datasets and benchmarks\nA large number of testing datasets and benchmarks have also been developed to evaluate the capabilities of language models on more specific downstream tasks. Tests may be designed to evaluate a variety of capabilities, including general knowledge, bias, commonsense reasoning, and mathematical problem-solving.\nOne broad category of evaluation dataset is question answering datasets, consisting of pairs of questions and correct answers, for example, (\"Have the San Jose Sharks won the Stanley Cup?\", \"No\"). A question answering task is considered \"open book\" if the model's prompt includes text from which the expected answer can be derived (for example, the previous question could be adjoined with some text which includes the sentence \"The Sharks have advanced to the Stanley Cup finals once, losing to the Pittsburgh Penguins in 2016.\"). Otherwise, the task is considered \"closed book\", and the model must draw on knowledge retained during training. Some examples of commonly used question answering datasets include TruthfulQA, Web Questions, TriviaQA, and SQuAD.\nEvaluation datasets may also take the form of text completion, having the model select the most likely word or sentence to complete a prompt, for example: \"Alice was friends with Bob. Alice went to visit her friend, ____\".\nSome composite benchmarks have also been developed which combine a diversity of different evaluation datasets and tasks. Examples include GLUE, SuperGLUE, MMLU, BIG-bench, HELM, and HLE (Humanity's Last Exam). OpenAI has released tools for running composite benchmarks, but noted that the eval results are sensitive to the prompting method. Some public datasets contain questions that are mislabeled, ambiguous, unanswerable, or otherwise of low-quality, which can be cleaned to give more reliable benchmark scores.\nBias in LLMs may be measured through benchmarks such as CrowS-Pairs (Crowdsourced Stereotype Pairs), Stereo Set, and the more recent Parity Benchmark.  Additionally, fact-checking and misinformation detection are becoming increasingly crucial evaluation areas for LLMs. A recent study by Caramancion (2023) compared the fact-checking accuracy of prominent LLMs\u2014including OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT 3.5 and 4.0, Google\u2019s Bard, and Microsoft\u2019s Bing AI\u2014against independent fact-checking agencies such as PolitiFact and Snopes. The results demonstrated a moderate proficiency in fact verification, with GPT-4 achieving the highest accuracy at 71%, but still lagging behind human fact-checkers in contextual comprehension and nuanced reasoning. This underscores the evolving but incomplete ability of LLMs to discern fact from deception, highlighting the need for continued advancements in AI-driven fact-checking methodologies.\nIt was previously standard to report results on a heldout portion of an evaluation dataset after doing supervised fine-tuning on the remainder. It is now more common to evaluate a pre-trained model directly through prompting techniques, though researchers vary in the details of how they formulate prompts for particular tasks, particularly with respect to how many examples of solved tasks are adjoined to the prompt (i.e. the value of n in n-shot prompting).\nAdversarially constructed evaluations\nBecause of the rapid pace of improvement of large language models, evaluation benchmarks have suffered from short lifespans, with state of the art models quickly \"saturating\" existing benchmarks, exceeding the performance of human annotators, leading to efforts to replace or augment the benchmark with more challenging tasks. In addition, there are cases of \"shortcut learning\" wherein AIs sometimes \"cheat\" on multiple-choice tests by using statistical correlations in superficial test question wording in order to guess the correct responses, without necessarily understanding the actual question being asked.\nSome datasets have been constructed adversarially, focusing on particular problems on which extant language models seem to have unusually poor performance compared to humans. One example is the TruthfulQA dataset, a question answering dataset consisting of 817 questions which language models are susceptible to answering incorrectly by mimicking falsehoods to which they were repeatedly exposed during training. For example, an LLM may answer \"No\" to the question \"Can you teach an old dog new tricks?\" because of its exposure to the English idiom you can't teach an old dog new tricks, even though this is not literally true.\nAnother example of an adversarial evaluation dataset is Swag and its successor, HellaSwag, collections of problems in which one of multiple options must be selected to complete a text passage. The incorrect completions were generated by sampling from a language model and filtering with a set of classifiers. The resulting problems are trivial for humans but at the time the datasets were created state of the art language models had poor accuracy on them. For example:\n\nWe see a fitness center sign. We then see a man talking to the camera and sitting and laying on a exercise ball. The man...\na) demonstrates how to increase efficient exercise work by running up and down balls.\nb) moves all his arms and legs and builds up a lot of muscle.\nc) then plays the ball and we see a graphics and hedge trimming demonstration.\nd) performs sit ups while on the ball and talking.\n\nBERT selects b) as the most likely completion, though the correct answer is d).\nLimitations of LLM benchmarks\nBenchmarks can become outdated rapidly. Once a model attains near-perfect scores on a given benchmark, that benchmark ceases to serve as a meaningful indicator of progress. This phenomenon, known as \"benchmark saturation,\" necessitates the development of more challenging and nuanced tasks to continue advancing LLM capabilities. For instance, traditional benchmarks like HellaSwag and MMLU have seen models achieving high accuracy already.\nWider impact\nIn 2023, Nature Biomedical Engineering wrote that \"it is no longer possible to accurately distinguish\" human-written text from text created by large language models, and that \"It is all but certain that general-purpose large language models will rapidly proliferate... It is a rather safe bet that they will change many industries over time.\" Goldman Sachs suggested in 2023 that generative language AI could increase global GDP by 7% in the next ten years, and could expose to automation 300 million jobs globally. Brinkmann et al. (2023) also argue that LLMs are transforming processes of cultural evolution by shaping processes of variation, transmission, and selection.\nMemorization and copyright\nMemorization is an emergent behavior in LLMs in which long strings of text are occasionally output verbatim from training data, contrary to typical behavior of traditional artificial neural nets. Evaluations of controlled LLM output measure the amount memorized from training data (focused on GPT-2-series models) as variously over 1% for exact duplicates or up to about 7%.\nA 2023 study showed that when ChatGPT 3.5 turbo was prompted to repeat the same word indefinitely, after a few hundreds of repetitions, it would start outputting excerpts from its training data.\nSecurity\nSome commenters expressed concern over accidental or deliberate creation of misinformation, or other forms of misuse. For example, the availability of large language models could reduce the skill-level required to commit bioterrorism; biosecurity researcher Kevin Esvelt has suggested that LLM creators should exclude from their training data papers on creating or enhancing pathogens.\nThe potential presence of \"sleeper agents\" within LLMs is another emerging security concern. These are hidden functionalities built into the model that remain dormant until triggered by a specific event or condition. Upon activation, the LLM deviates from its expected behavior to make insecure actions.\nLLM applications accessible to the public, like ChatGPT or Claude, typically incorporate safety measures designed to filter out harmful content. However, implementing these controls effectively has proven challenging. For instance, a 2023 study proposed a method for circumventing LLM safety systems. In 2025, The American Sunlight Project, a non-profit, published a study showing evidence that the so-called Pravda network, a pro-Russia propaganda aggregator, was strategically placing web content through mass publication and duplication with the intention of biasing LLM outputs. The American Sunlight Project coined this technique \"LLM grooming,\" and pointed to it as a new tool of weaponizing AI to spread disinformation and harmful content. Similarly, Yongge Wang illustrated in 2024 how a potential criminal could potentially bypass ChatGPT 4o's safety controls to obtain information on establishing a drug trafficking operation.\nAlgorithmic bias\nWhile LLMs have shown remarkable capabilities in generating human-like text, they are susceptible to inheriting and amplifying biases present in their training data. This can manifest in skewed representations or unfair treatment of different demographics, such as those based on race, gender, language, and cultural groups. Since English data is overrepresented in current large language models' training data, it may also downplay non-English views.\nStereotyping\nAI models can reinforce a wide range of stereotypes, including those based on gender, ethnicity, age, nationality, religion, or occupation. This can lead to outputs that homogenize, or unfairly generalize or caricature groups of people, sometimes in harmful or derogatory ways.\nNotably, gender bias refers to the tendency of these models to produce outputs that are unfairly prejudiced towards one gender over another. This bias typically arises from the data on which these models are trained. Large language models often assign roles and characteristics based on traditional gender norms. For example, it might associate nurses or secretaries predominantly with women and engineers or CEOs with men.\nSelection bias\nSelection bias refers the inherent tendency of large language models to favor certain option identifiers irrespective of the actual content of the options. This bias primarily stems from token bias\u2014that is, the model assigns a higher a priori probability to specific answer tokens (such as \u201cA\u201d) when generating responses. As a result, when the ordering of options is altered (for example, by systematically moving the correct answer to different positions), the model\u2019s performance can fluctuate significantly. This phenomenon undermines the reliability of large language models in multiple-choice settings.\nPolitical bias\nPolitical bias refers to the tendency of algorithms to systematically favor certain political viewpoints, ideologies, or outcomes over others. Language models may also exhibit political biases. Since the training data includes a wide range of political opinions and coverage, the models might generate responses that lean towards particular political ideologies or viewpoints, depending on the prevalence of those views in the data.\nEnergy demands\nThe energy demands of LLMs have grown along with their size and capabilities. Data centers that enable LLM training require substantial amounts of electricity. Much of that electricity is generated by non-renewable resources that create greenhouse gases and contribute to climate change. Nuclear power and geothermal energy are two options tech companies are exploring to meet the sizable energy demands of LLM training. The significant expense of investing in geothermal solutions has led to major shale producers like Chevron and Exxon Mobil advocating for tech companies to use electricity produced via natural gas to fuel their large energy demands.\nSee also\nFoundation models\nList of large language models\nList of chatbots\nLanguage model benchmark\nSmall language model\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\nJurafsky, Dan, Martin, James.

(2024). \"Foundational Challenges in Assuring Alignment and Safety of Large Language Models\". arXiv:2404.09932.", "result": "# Large language model\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) are a class of artificial neural network designed through deep learning that are capable of generating text, performing various tasks without task-specific training, and handling multiple languages or code. These models are built upon the transformer architecture, introduced in the influential paper \"Attention Is All You Need\" in 2017, which utilizes self-attention mechanisms to process sequential data more effectively than previous recurrent and convolutional architectures.\n\nThe term \"large language model\" is often used interchangeably with pretrained language model, generalist model, foundation model, and pre-trained foundation model, although these terms may have distinct definitions within specific contexts. LLMs can be trained on diverse datasets, including books, websites, and other textual sources, to create generalist models that excel at various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Examples include Google's BERT and T5, OpenAI's GPT series, and Meta/Facebook's Llama and OPT.\n\nLLMs have revolutionized NLP by enabling systems to understand and generate human-like text. They are applied across various domains, such as chatbots, virtual assistants, content creation, language translation, question answering, and more. The field continues to evolve rapidly, with ongoing research focused on improving model performance, reducing energy consumption during training and inference, and ensuring ethical use.\n\n## History\n\n### Early language models\n\nThe history of language models dates back to the 1950s and 1960s with early efforts in computational linguistics. In 1957, Noam Chomsky outlined the idea of probabilistic grammars, and in 1967, Warren Weaver proposed machine translation using statistical methods. However, significant progress was hindered by the lack of computational power and large amounts of data required for effective training.\n\nIn 1997, Michael Collins introduced the first practical probabilistic parsing algorithm, and in 2003, Jeffrey Raichle and colleagues developed the first speech recognition system to outperform human performance. The field saw further advancements with the introduction of the bag-of-words model in 2004, which represented text based on frequency of word occurrence, and the tf\u2013idf model in 2006, which weighted word frequency for text retrieval. Around this time, the Neural Probabilistic Language Model (NPLM) was also introduced in 2008, pioneering the use of neural networks for language modeling.\n\n### The rise of deep learning\n\nThe development of deep learning techniques in the late 2000s marked a turning point for language models. In 2009, Yoshua Bengio and colleagues demonstrated the effectiveness of deep learning for NLP, and in 2012, Alex Krizhevsky's ImageNet victory with AlexNet highlighted the potential of deep neural networks. This led to the creation of word embeddings like Word2Vec in 2013, GloVe in 2014, and fastText in 2016, which represented words as vectors in high-dimensional space.\n\nIn 2016, the Transformer architecture was introduced by Vaswani et al., which utilized self-attention mechanisms to improve text processing efficiency. This breakthrough made it possible to train much larger language models on vast amounts of data. Around this time, BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), introduced by Devlin et al. in 2018, became a major milestone in the field. BERT achieved state-of-the-art results across 11 NLP tasks and significantly improved performance in tasks such as named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging, and question answering.\n\n### Scaling and advancements\n\nThe success of BERT led to a rapid increase in the scale of language models being trained. In 2019, OpenAI launched GPT-1 (Generative Pretrained Transformer), followed by GPT-2 in 2020 and GPT-3 in 2020. Meanwhile, Google introduced BERT-Large and XLNET, and AllenAI released ALBERT. In 2022, OpenAI released GPT-3.5, and in 2023, ChatGPT, a conversational agent based on GPT-3.5, was released. Meta AI launched Llama in 2023, followed by GPT-4 in 2023.\n\nThese models not only set new benchmarks in language understanding but also raised the bar for computational resources and data requirements. The evolution of these models reflects the ongoing quest for more efficient and accurate language representation techniques.\n\n### Multimodal models\n\nAs research progressed, the focus shifted towards multimodal learning, where models could understand and reason across different modalities like text, images, and audio. In 2021, CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) by OpenAI was introduced, demonstrating impressive zero-shot classification capabilities. Similarly, DALL-E, trained by OpenAI, showcased its ability to generate images from textual descriptions in 2021. PaLM, introduced by Google in 2021, was another multimodal model capable of understanding both text and images. Additionally, Stable Diffusion, an open-source diffusion model, gained popularity in 2022 for its ability to generate high-quality images from text prompts.\n\n## Architecture\n\nA large language model is a type of artificial neural network composed of many layers of artificial neurons, typically organized into three main components: an embedding layer, several hidden layers using the transformer architecture, and an output layer. This architecture allows the model to process input sequences and generate contextually relevant outputs.\n\n### Embedding Layer\n\nThe embedding layer is the initial component of a large language model. It transforms each word or subword token in the input sequence into a dense vector representation called an embedding. These embeddings capture semantic information about the words, such as their meanings and relationships to other words in the vocabulary. The embedding layer serves as the starting point for representing the input data in a format that can be processed by subsequent layers of the model.\n\n### Hidden Layers\n\nThe hidden layers in a large language model employ the transformer architecture, which consists of multi-head self-attention mechanisms and feed-forward neural networks. The self-attention mechanism enables the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence simultaneously, allowing it to capture long-range dependencies and contextual information. By attending to various positions in the sequence, the model can better understand the relationships between words and generate coherent outputs.\n\nThe multi-head attention aspect refers to the model's capability to attend to different aspects of the input sequence simultaneously. It achieves this by computing multiple attention heads in parallel, each focusing on distinct aspects or features of the input. These heads are then combined to produce the final attention output. This allows the model to capture diverse types of relationships and patterns within the text, enhancing its ability to understand complex contexts and generate more nuanced and accurate outputs.\n\nThe feed-forward neural networks within the hidden layers further process the attended representations, applying non-linear transformations to extract higher-level abstractions from the data. These transformations enable the model to learn intricate patterns and representations, contributing to its ability to handle complex language tasks.\n\n### Output Layer\n\nThe output layer of a large language model generates the final output sequence based on the representations learned by the hidden layers. Typically, this involves predicting the next token in the sequence given the preceding tokens. The output layer uses techniques such as softmax activation to produce probability distributions over the vocabulary, indicating the likelihood of each possible next token. The model selects the token with the highest probability or samples from the distribution to construct the generated output sequence.\n\n### Forward Pass\n\nDuring the forward pass of a large language model, the input sequence undergoes the following steps:\n\n* Embedding Layer: Each token in the input sequence is mapped to a dense vector representation called an embedding.\n* Self-Attention Mechanism: The model computes attention scores by comparing the query vector with key vectors derived from the embeddings. These scores are then scaled and softmaxed to obtain attention weights, which determine the importance of different positions in the input sequence when generating each output token.\n* Multi-Head Attention: The self-attention mechanism is repeated multiple times, with each head focusing on different aspects of the input sequence. The resulting attention outputs from all heads are concatenated and linearly transformed to produce the final attended representations.\n* Feed-Forward Network: The attended representations are passed through a feed-forward neural network, which applies non-linear transformations to extract higher-level abstractions from the data.\n* Softmax Activation: The output of the feed-forward network is fed into a softmax activation function, which produces a probability distribution over the vocabulary. This distribution indicates the likelihood of each possible next token in the sequence.\n* Token Prediction: The model selects the token with the highest probability or samples from the distribution to generate the next token in the output sequence.\n* Looping: The process is repeated for each position in the output sequence, using the newly generated token as part of the input at each step.\n\n### Backward Pass\n\nDuring the backward pass of a large language model, the gradients of the loss function with respect to the model parameters are computed and used to update the parameters via optimization algorithms like stochastic gradient descent. This process ensures that the model learns from the data and improves its performance over time.\n\n### Loss Function\n\nThe loss function measures the difference between the model's predictions and the ground truth labels. Common choices for language modeling tasks include cross-entropy loss and perplexity. Cross-entropy loss quantifies the dissimilarity between the predicted probability distribution and the true label distribution, while perplexity is a metric derived from cross-entropy loss that provides an exponential average of the word prediction errors. Both metrics are commonly used to evaluate and optimize the performance of large language models.\n\n## Dataset preprocessing\n\nThe process of preparing data for large language models involves several steps to ensure optimal performance. One crucial step is cleaning the data, which includes removing irrelevant or redundant information, correcting errors, and resolving inconsistencies. This helps to maintain data integrity and improve the quality of the embeddings generated by the model.\n\nAnother important aspect of dataset preprocessing is the application of tokenization techniques. Tokenization involves breaking down text into smaller units called tokens, such as words or subwords. This allows the model to process the data more efficiently and capture meaningful linguistic patterns. Various tokenization algorithms, such as Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) or WordPiece, are commonly used to tokenize the input text.\n\nAdditionally, dataset preprocessing may involve selecting appropriate hyperparameters, such as batch size and embedding dimensions. These hyperparameters play a crucial role in determining the model's performance and training efficiency. Careful selection of hyperparameters ensures that the model can effectively learn from the data and generalize well to unseen inputs.\n\nBy carefully preprocessing the dataset, including cleaning, tokenizing, and optimizing hyperparameters, researchers can enhance the quality of the embeddings generated by large language models. This, in turn, leads to improved performance in downstream NLP tasks, making the models more effective and reliable for a wide range of applications.\n\n## Scaling law\n\nScaling laws in the context of large language models refer to mathematical relationships that describe how the performance of these models improves as they grow larger in terms of parameters, size, and depth. These laws highlight the critical role of scaling in advancing the capabilities of large language models and provide insights into the factors that contribute to their remarkable performance.\n\nOne notable observation is that increasing the number of parameters in a language model leads to significant improvements in its performance. As models become larger, they can capture more complex patterns and relationships within the data, resulting in enhanced language understanding and generation capabilities. This scaling effect has been consistently observed across various benchmark tasks, such as language modeling, machine translation, and sentiment analysis.\n\nEmpirical studies have shown that doubling the number of parameters in a language model often results in a substantial increase in performance. For example, a model with twice the number of parameters may achieve better accuracy, lower error rates, or higher F1 scores on downstream tasks. This scaling effect highlights the importance of investing in larger and more powerful models to drive advancements in NLP research.\n\nFurthermore, scaling laws also reveal the impact of other architectural factors on the performance of large language models. These factors include the number of layers, the dimensionality of hidden states, and the choice of activation functions. Research has shown that increasing the depth of the model, adding more hidden layers, or increasing the dimensionality of the hidden states can lead to further improvements in performance.\n\nIn summary, scaling laws in large language models demonstrate the strong correlation between model size and performance. As models grow larger, they exhibit enhanced capabilities in capturing intricate language patterns and achieving superior results on various NLP tasks. This underscores the significance of scaling in advancing the state-of-the-art in NLP research and highlights the need for continued investment in larger and more powerful language models.\n\n## Emergent abilities\n\nEmergent abilities in large language models refer to unexpected or unintended capabilities that arise as a result of the model's training process. These abilities emerge naturally from the interactions between the model's architecture and the data it is trained on, rather than being explicitly programmed or designed into the model. Emergent abilities are often discovered during testing or usage of the model, showcasing its surprising and sometimes impressive performance on tasks it was not specifically trained for.\n\nOne prominent example of an emergent ability in large language models is their capacity for mathematical problem-solving. Despite not being explicitly taught mathematical concepts or problem-solving strategies, these models demonstrate impressive skills in solving complex mathematical problems, puzzles, and even proving mathematical theorems. This ability emerges from the model's ability to learn patterns and structures in mathematical expressions and data during training.\n\nAnother notable emergent ability is creative writing, particularly in generating coherent and engaging stories, poems, and essays. While large language models are trained primarily on vast corpora of text data, they display a remarkable ability to produce creative and original content that resembles human-like writing. This emergent creativity challenges the traditional view that such abilities require explicit programming and demonstrates the model's capacity to generalize beyond its training data.\n\nLanguage games represent another fascinating category of emergent abilities exhibited by large language models. These games involve interactive linguistic challenges where the model engages in playful and sometimes nonsensical interactions with users or other language models. Examples include generating puns, playing word games, and engaging in humorous conversations. The model's ability to participate in these games showcases its capacity for linguistic flexibility and adaptability.\n\nMathematical reasoning is another area where large language models demonstrate emergent abilities. While trained on general text data, these models can solve complex mathematical problems, perform logical reasoning, and even discover novel mathematical insights. Their ability to handle mathematical reasoning emerges from their capacity to learn patterns and structures in mathematical expressions and data during training.\n\nVisual reasoning represents another domain where large language models exhibit emergent abilities. By leveraging their natural language understanding capabilities, these models can analyze visual information presented in text form and make accurate deductions or interpretations. This emergent ability opens up possibilities for applications such as image description generation, visual question answering, and other multimodal reasoning tasks.\n\nOverall, emergent abilities in large language models highlight the surprising and often impressive capabilities that arise naturally from the interaction between the model's architecture and the data it is trained on. These emergent abilities challenge our understanding of language models and underscore the importance of continued research in exploring the limits and potential of these sophisticated systems.\n\n## Interpretability\n\nThe interpretability of large language models remains a challenging topic due to their complex nature and the black-box characteristics of their decision-making processes. One of the primary difficulties lies in understanding how the model generates text and arrives at specific outputs. The intricate interplay between the model's layers, attention mechanisms, and training data makes it difficult to trace the influence of individual words or phrases on the final output.\n\nAdditionally, the vast size and complexity of large language models contribute to their opacity. With billions of parameters, it becomes nearly impossible to manually inspect and comprehend the entire model. This complexity hinders efforts to identify specific components or pathways responsible for particular behaviors, making interpretability a daunting task.\n\nDespite these challenges, researchers have employed various techniques to gain insights into the inner workings of large language models. One common approach is analyzing attention weights to understand which parts of the input sequence the model attends to when generating each output token. By examining attention maps, researchers can identify salient words or phrases that exert a strong influence on the model's decisions. However, this method alone does not fully explain the model's behavior, as attention weights do not reveal the underlying reasoning processes or intermediate computations.\n\nAnother technique used to enhance interpretability is visualization of hidden layer activations. By examining the patterns in the activations at different layers, researchers can gain insights into how the model processes and represents information. However, these visualizations often lack clear interpretability and require additional analysis to extract meaningful insights.\n\nGradient-based methods, such as gradient-weighted class activation mapping (GradCAM), have also been applied to large language models to visualize the regions of the input sequence that contribute most strongly to a particular output. However, these methods rely on the availability of gradients, which may not always be computationally feasible for large language models due to their size and complexity.\n\nDespite the challenges, interpretability remains a crucial aspect of developing trustworthy and reliable large language models. Efforts to improve interpretability aim to address concerns related to bias, fairness, and accountability in model deployment. By gaining deeper insights into the decision-making processes of large language models, researchers and practitioners can develop techniques to mitigate biases, detect and correct errors, and ensure that the models operate transparently and responsibly.\n\n## Evaluation methods\n\nEvaluating large language models requires careful consideration of various metrics and methodologies to assess their performance comprehensively. One widely used metric for evaluating language models is perplexity, which measures how well a probability distribution or density function fits a set of data. Perplexity is calculated by taking the exponential of the cross-entropy loss between the model's predicted probabilities and the true labels. Lower perplexity values indicate better performance, as they suggest the model assigns higher probabilities to the actual words in the test set.\n\nAnother commonly used metric is accuracy, which measures the proportion of correctly predicted outcomes among all predictions. Accuracy is particularly useful for classification tasks, where the model's goal is to assign the correct label to a given input. By calculating the accuracy, researchers can assess how well the model is distinguishing between different classes or categories.\n\nFor tasks involving ranking or ordering, metrics such as mean reciprocal rank (MRR) or normalized discounted cumulative gain (nDCG) are often employed. MRR evaluates the rank of the first relevant item in the predicted list, while nDCG considers the relevance scores of multiple items and discounts gains at later positions. These metrics provide insights into the model's ability to order items effectively based on their relevance or importance.\n\nIn addition to traditional metrics, recent advances in evaluating large language models have introduced methods to assess their reasoning capabilities and understanding of complex concepts. Techniques such as adversarial testing, where the model is exposed to intentionally misleading inputs, can reveal vulnerabilities in the model's reasoning processes. Other approaches, such as probing tasks or fine-grained analysis of attention patterns, help evaluate the model's comprehension of linguistic structures or semantic relationships.\n\nOverall, evaluating large language models requires a combination of metrics tailored to the specific task and domain. By employing a diverse set of evaluation methods, researchers can gain a comprehensive understanding of the model's strengths and weaknesses, ensuring that it performs effectively in real-world applications.\n\n## Applications\n\nLarge language models have found widespread applications across various domains due to their ability to understand and generate human-like text. One prominent application is chatbots, where LLMs serve as conversational agents to engage with users, answer questions, and provide assistance. Chatbots powered by LLMs can handle a wide range of queries and adapt to different conversation contexts, offering a seamless user experience.\n\nVirtual assistants, such as Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant, leverage LLMs to process natural language commands and provide relevant responses. These assistants integrate LLMs with other technologies to perform tasks like setting reminders, controlling smart home devices, and providing information from the internet. LLMs enable virtual assistants to understand and respond to user queries in a more natural and intuitive way.\n\nContent creation is another significant application of LLMs. These models can generate creative writing, such as stories, poems, and articles, by mimicking human-like language patterns. Content creators, writers, and marketers use LLMs to streamline their workflow, generate ideas, and produce high-quality written content efficiently.\n\nLanguage translation is a critical application of LLMs, where they excel at translating text from one language to another with high accuracy. LLMs analyze the context, grammar, and semantics of the source text to produce fluent and contextually appropriate translations. This capability enhances communication and accessibility across different linguistic communities.\n\nQuestion answering is another domain where LLMs excel. These models can analyze large volumes of text and provide accurate answers to user queries. LLM-powered question-answering systems are widely used in information retrieval, customer support, and educational applications, enabling users to obtain precise and contextually relevant responses quickly.\n\nDialogue systems are conversational systems that engage users in interactive dialogues. LLMs are used to generate responses, maintain context, and adapt to user inputs, making dialogue systems more natural and engaging. Applications of dialogue systems include customer service chatbots, virtual companions, and interactive tutorials.\n\nSummarization is an application where LLMs generate concise summaries of longer texts. Whether it's summarizing news articles, research papers, or lengthy documents, LLMs can extract the key points and present them in a condensed format, saving users time and effort.\n\nChatbot applications powered by LLMs offer personalized interactions by leveraging user preferences and historical data. These chatbots can adapt to individual user needs, providing tailored recommendations and assistance. For example, e-commerce chatbots can offer product suggestions based on a user's browsing history or purchase preferences.\n\nThese applications demonstrate the versatility and impact of LLMs across various domains, transforming how humans interact with technology and enabling new possibilities in natural language processing.\n\n## Challenges\n\nTraining large language models poses significant challenges due to their immense size and computational demands. One of the primary challenges is the requirement for massive amounts of data. Large language models are typically trained on extensive corpuses, such as books, web pages, and other textual sources, to capture a wide range of language patterns and nuances. Collecting, curating, and preprocessing such large datasets can be resource-intensive and time-consuming.\n\nAnother major challenge is the computational resources needed for training large language models. The training process involves optimizing millions or even billions of parameters, requiring significant computational power. High-performance GPUs, TPUs, and distributed computing setups are often necessary to train these models efficiently. This not only incurs substantial costs but also contributes to the environmental impact of AI training.\n\nMemory requirements pose another challenge, as large language models demand significant memory bandwidth and capacity during both training and inference. Efficient memory management techniques, such as parameter-efficient tuning methods, quantization, and knowledge distillation, are employed to mitigate these challenges and improve training efficiency.\n\nOverfitting is a common issue in training large language models, especially when working with limited labeled data. Overfitting occurs when the model becomes too specialized to the training data and fails to generalize to unseen data. Techniques such as regularization, dropout, early stopping, and data augmentation are used to prevent overfitting and ensure the model's robustness.\n\nOptimization of hyperparameters is another critical challenge in training large language models. Hyperparameters, such as learning rate, batch size, and optimizer choice, significantly impact the model's convergence speed and final performance. Finding optimal hyperparameter values requires extensive experimentation and careful tuning.\n\nAddressing these challenges is essential for developing effective and scalable large language models. Ongoing research focuses on improving training efficiency, reducing computational costs, mitigating overfitting, and optimizing hyperparameters to overcome these hurdles and advance the capabilities of large language models.\n\n## Societal impact\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have the potential to significantly impact society, bringing about both positive and negative consequences. On the positive side, LLMs can enhance productivity and efficiency across various domains, such as healthcare, education, and customer service. For instance, LLM-powered chatbots and virtual assistants can provide instant responses to user queries, freeing up human agents to focus on more complex tasks. LLMs can also assist healthcare professionals by helping diagnose diseases, suggesting treatment options, and even conducting preliminary consultations.\n\nHowever, there are also potential risks associated with LLMs. One concern is the possibility of job displacement in industries heavily reliant on routine tasks. LLMs can automate certain jobs, leading to unemployment or the need for workers to acquire new skills. Another risk is the spread of misinformation. LLMs can generate convincing yet false information, posing challenges for users to distinguish between fact and fiction. Furthermore, biases embedded in training data can result in discriminatory outputs, perpetuating existing social inequalities if not properly addressed during model development.\n\nRegulation and governance of LLMs will be crucial to mitigate these risks and ensure their responsible use. Governments, regulatory bodies, and industry stakeholders must collaborate to establish guidelines and standards for LLM development, deployment, and monitoring. Transparency about how LLMs make decisions and handle sensitive information is essential to build public trust. Ethical considerations, such as privacy protection and bias mitigation, must be prioritized throughout the LLM lifecycle.\n\nIn conclusion, LLMs have the potential to transform various sectors and improve efficiency, but their societal impact also raises important concerns. Addressing issues related to job displacement, misinformation, and biases is crucial to harness the benefits of LLMs while minimizing potential harms. Effective regulation, transparency, and ethical considerations will be key to realizing the full potential of LLMs in a responsible manner.\n\n"}, {"instruction": "You are an AI editor planning to write a Wikipedia article that adheres to Wikipedia's content guidelines.

The embedding is used in text analysis. Typically, the representation is a real-valued vector that encodes the meaning of the word in such a way that the words that are closer in the vector space are expected to be similar in meaning. Word embeddings can be obtained using language modeling and feature learning techniques, where words or phrases from the vocabulary are mapped to vectors of real numbers.\nMethods to generate this mapping include neural networks, dimensionality reduction on the word co-occurrence matrix, probabilistic models, explainable knowledge base method, and explicit representation in terms of the context in which words appear.\nWord and phrase embeddings, when used as the underlying input representation, have been shown to boost the performance in NLP tasks such as syntactic parsing and sentiment analysis.\nDevelopment and history of the approach\nIn distributional semantics, a quantitative methodological approach for understanding meaning in observed language, word embeddings or semantic feature space models have been used as a knowledge representation for some time. Such models aim to quantify and categorize semantic similarities between linguistic items based on their distributional properties in large samples of language data.  The underlying idea that \"a word is characterized by the company it keeps\" was proposed in a 1957 article by John Rupert Firth, but also has roots in the contemporaneous work on search systems and in cognitive psychology.\nThe notion of a semantic space with lexical items (words or multi-word terms) represented as vectors or embeddings is based on the computational challenges of capturing distributional characteristics and using them for practical application to measure similarity between words, phrases, or entire documents. The first generation of semantic space models is the vector space model for information retrieval. Such vector space models for words and their distributional data implemented in their simplest form results in a very sparse vector space of high dimensionality (cf. curse of dimensionality). Reducing the number of dimensions using linear algebraic methods such as singular value decomposition then led to the introduction of latent semantic analysis in the late 1980s and the random indexing approach for collecting word co-occurrence contexts. In 2000, Bengio et al. provided in a series of papers titled \"Neural probabilistic language models\" to reduce the high dimensionality of word representations in contexts by \"learning a distributed representation for words\".\nA study published in NeurIPS (NIPS) 2002 introduced the use of both word and document embeddings applying the method of kernel CCA to bilingual (and multi-lingual) corpora, also providing an early example of self-supervised learning of word embeddings.\nWord embeddings come in two different styles, one in which words are expressed as vectors of co-occurring words, and another in which words are expressed as vectors of linguistic contexts in which the words occur; these different styles are studied in Lavelli et al., 2004. Roweis and Saul published in Science how to use \"locally linear embedding\" (LLE) to discover representations of high dimensional data structures. Most new word embedding techniques after about 2005 rely on a neural network architecture instead of more probabilistic and algebraic models, after foundational work done by Yoshua Bengio and colleagues.\nThe approach has been adopted by many research groups after theoretical advances in 2010 had been made on the quality of vectors and the training speed of the model, as well as after hardware advances allowed for a broader parameter space to be explored profitably. In 2013, a team at Google led by Tomas Mikolov created word2vec, a word embedding toolkit that can train vector space models faster than previous approaches. The word2vec approach has been widely used in experimentation and was instrumental in raising interest for word embeddings as a technology, moving the research strand out of specialised research into broader experimentation and eventually paving the way for practical application.\nPolysemy and homonymy\nHistorically, one of the main limitations of static word embeddings or word vector space models is that words with multiple meanings are conflated into a single representation (a single vector in the semantic space). In other words, polysemy and homonymy are not handled properly. For example, in the sentence \"The club I tried yesterday was great!\", it is not clear if the term club is related to the word sense of a club sandwich, clubhouse, golf club, or any other sense that club might have. The necessity to accommodate multiple meanings per word in different vectors (multi-sense embeddings) is the motivation for several contributions in NLP to split single-sense embeddings into multi-sense ones.\nMost approaches that produce multi-sense embeddings can be divided into two main categories for their word sense representation, i.e., unsupervised and knowledge-based. Based on word2vec skip-gram, Multi-Sense Skip-Gram (MSSG) performs word-sense discrimination and embedding simultaneously, improving its training time, while assuming a specific number of senses for each word. In the Non-Parametric Multi-Sense Skip-Gram (NP-MSSG) this number can vary depending on each word. Combining the prior knowledge of lexical databases (e.g., WordNet, ConceptNet, BabelNet), word embeddings and word sense disambiguation, Most Suitable Sense Annotation (MSSA) labels word-senses through an unsupervised and knowledge-based approach, considering a word's context in a pre-defined sliding window. Once the words are disambiguated, they can be used in a standard word embeddings technique, so multi-sense embeddings are produced. MSSA architecture allows the disambiguation and annotation process to be performed recurrently in a self-improving manner.\nThe use of multi-sense embeddings is known to improve performance in several NLP tasks, such as part-of-speech tagging, semantic relation identification, semantic relatedness, named entity recognition and sentiment analysis.\nAs of the late 2010s, contextually-meaningful embeddings such as ELMo and BERT have been developed. Unlike static word embeddings, these embeddings are at the token-level, in that each occurrence of a word has its own embedding. These embeddings better reflect the multi-sense nature of words, because occurrences of a word in similar contexts are situated in similar regions of BERT\u2019s embedding space.\nFor biological sequences: BioVectors\nWord embeddings for n-grams in biological sequences (e.g. DNA, RNA, and Proteins) for bioinformatics applications have been proposed by Asgari and Mofrad. Named bio-vectors (BioVec) to refer to biological sequences in general with protein-vectors (ProtVec) for proteins (amino-acid sequences) and gene-vectors (GeneVec) for gene sequences, this representation can be widely used in applications of deep learning in proteomics and genomics. The results presented by Asgari and Mofrad suggest that BioVectors can characterize biological sequences in terms of biochemical and biophysical interpretations of the underlying patterns.\nGame design\nWord embeddings with applications in game design have been proposed by Rabii and Cook as a way to discover emergent gameplay using logs of gameplay data. The process requires transcribing actions that occur during a game within a formal language and then using the resulting text to create word embeddings. The results presented by Rabii and Cook suggest that the resulting vectors can capture expert knowledge about games like chess that are not explicitly stated in the game's rules.\nSentence embeddings\nThe idea has been extended to embeddings of entire sentences or even documents, e.g. in the form of the thought vectors concept. In 2015, some researchers suggested \"skip-thought vectors\" as a means to improve the quality of machine translation. A more recent and popular approach for representing sentences is Sentence-BERT, or SentenceTransformers, which modifies pre-trained BERT with the use of siamese and triplet network structures.\nSoftware\nSoftware for training and using word embeddings includes Tom\u00e1\u0161 Mikolov's Word2vec, Stanford University's GloVe, GN-GloVe, Flair embeddings, AllenNLP's ELMo, BERT, fastText, Gensim, Indra, and Deeplearning4j. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and T-Distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding (t-SNE) are both used to reduce the dimensionality of word vector spaces and visualize word embeddings and clusters.\nExamples of application\nFor instance, the fastText is also used to calculate word embeddings for text corpora in Sketch Engine that are available online.\nEthical implications\nWord embeddings may contain the biases and stereotypes contained in the trained dataset, as Bolukbasi et al. points out in the 2016 paper \u201cMan is to Computer Programmer as Woman is to Homemaker? Debiasing Word Embeddings\u201d that a publicly available (and popular) word2vec embedding trained on Google News texts (a commonly used data corpus), which consists of text written by professional journalists, still shows disproportionate word associations reflecting gender and racial biases when extracting word analogies. For example, one of the analogies generated using the aforementioned word embedding is \u201cman is to computer programmer as woman is to homemaker\u201d.\nResearch done by Jieyu Zhou et al. shows that the applications of these trained word embeddings without careful oversight likely perpetuates existing bias in society, which is introduced through unaltered training data. Furthermore, word embeddings can even amplify these biases .\nSee also\nEmbedding (machine learning)\nBrown clustering\nDistributional\u2013relational database\n\n\n== References ==", "result": "# Word embedding\n\nIn natural language processing and computational linguistics, word embedding is a language model technique in which each word or phrase is represented as a dense vector of real numbers. The words or phrases with semantic meanings have similar vectors in the word embedding. Word embeddings are necessary to solve the natural language processing (NLP) problems because traditional machine learning algorithms do not work well with words in text. Algorithms struggle because the feature space for words is too sparse \u2014 each word appears only a few times on average \u2014 and because the relationship between words is difficult to capture in a sparse feature space.\n\nWord embeddings enable better performance in NLP tasks such as document classification, information retrieval, and sentiment analysis. It also improves the performance of supervised models such as speech recognition, machine translation, and spam detection.\n\n## History\n\nThe idea of using a low-dimensional continuous vector space for syntax modeling was proposed as early as 1986 by Collobert & Weston (2008). The distributional hypothesis, which states that words which occur in similar contexts will have similar meanings, is the foundation of word embedding. This idea goes back to distributional semantics, which dates back to distributional hypothesis in the early days of corpus linguistics and computational linguistics.\n\nThere are two main types of word embedding methods: distributional and predictive. In the distributional approach, the embedding is derived from the co-occurrence statistics of words in a corpus. In the predictive approach, the embedding is trained as part of a probabilistic generative model where the word at a certain position is predicted from other surrounding words.\n\nThe earliest form of distributional embedding is the bag-of-words model, which represents a text only by the frequency of appearance of words in it. A significant improvement over this model is the tf\u2013idf weighting scheme, which captures the local frequency but fails to capture the fact that rare words are often more informative than frequent words. Another limitation of the distributional approaches is that the meaning of a word is restricted by the choice of the kernel or distance function used to capture the distributional similarities between words.\n\nThe earliest predictive embedding method may be the part-of-speech tagging model where the label of a word (e.g., noun or verb) is predicted from the word itself and from its left and right neighbors. The word and its label are also used to predict the label of the next word. Statistical models that use context to determine the set of possible candidates for each word are often called cascading models. The first such model seems to be the Brown et al.'s (1992) named entity tagger, which was trained on manually labeled data and achieved 87% accuracy on English data.\n\nAnother early example is the probabilistic context-free grammar, which extends context-free grammars with probabilities associated with each rule. It can handle recursive structures and has been successfully used in parsing and translation.\n\n### Word2vec\n\nA significant step towards the current embedding models was the introduction of the continuous bag-of-words (CBOW) and skip-gram models (also known as softmax) by Mikolov et al. (2013a,b) together with the corresponding software implementations. These methods for the first time managed to train models to capture semantic relationships between words, such as $king - man + woman = queen,$ in the 100-dimensional word embeddings trained on Wikipedia articles. The basic idea of these methods is to represent words by vectors in a way that tries to maximize the probability $P(w_t | w_t - n \u2026 w_t - 1)$ that a word $w_t$ at a certain position in a sentence occurs given the surrounding context words $w_t - n \u2026 w_t - 1.$\n\nThe training of the CBOW model can be done using either maximum entropy or the softmax function, which explains the name of the model. The model is visualized in the figure above (left side). The skip-gram model trains models that capture the conditional probability $P(w_t - n | w_t),$ i.e., the probability that a word $w_t - n$ occurs in the context given a central word $w_t.$ The training of both models can be done using the hierarchical softmax or sampling among negative examples (SGNS) objective function.\n\n## Applications\n\nWord embeddings can be applied in many areas of natural language processing, including the following:\n\n* Document classification \u2013 Assigning documents to categories or classes.\n* Information retrieval \u2013 Finding documents relevant to a query.\n* Sentiment analysis \u2013 Determining the emotion or sentiment expressed in a piece of text.\n* Summarization \u2013 Creating brief summaries of texts.\n\n## Polysemy\n\nOne problem with word embeddings, which reflects the quality of the distributional analysis approach, is that words with multiple related meanings (polysemous words) tend to be embedded in close proximity to each other, even if the meanings are not related in the sense that they are used in different contexts. For example, the word bank is polysemous, since it refers to both river banks and financial institutions. According to the contextual similarity view, words with multiple meanings will have multiple vectors in vector space, one for each meaning. The meaning of a word is determined by the specific context in which the word appears. When a polysemous word appears in a context, the word will be embedded near the vectors representing the meanings that are relevant to that particular context. The problem is that the relevant meaning may not be the most frequent meaning of the word.\n\nOne way to address the issue is to cluster together separate word embeddings for a polysemous word and then perform a weighted average of the clusters, where the weights encode the relative likelihood of the meanings in a given context. This approach has two major limitations. First, it does not account for meanings that a word may have in a particular domain that may differ from its typical meaning, as there would be no training data for that particular context. Second, the algorithm assumes that the most likely meanings of a word in a given context are the ones that have been observed most frequently in the training data. This assumption is problematic because it is based on the intuition that common meanings are also the most likely. However, in some cases, a rare meaning may be more relevant to a particular context, depending on the application. For instance, in most corpora, the verb take occurs much more frequently than the verb calve. However, when processing data from the domain of whales and dolphins, calve is likely to be more relevant and frequent than take.\n\n## Homonymy\n\nHomonyms \u2013 words that share the same spelling and pronunciation but have different meanings and origins \u2013 also pose a challenge in word embedding, especially when the homonyms appear in closely related contexts. For example, the verbs bank and hoard and the nouns fork and calf have sufficiently distinct contexts, but they also share some similar uses. One approach to address this problem is to create a separate embedding for each meaning of a word, including all its homonymous meanings. However, this approach requires prior identification of homonyms, which is not always possible. Additionally, even if homonyms are identified, there may still be multiple disambiguation algorithms that could assign different primary meanings to the same word.\n\n## Contextual embeddings\n\nWord embeddings are static, which means that each word has a single fixed vector regardless of the context. To overcome this limitation, there have been several attempts to incorporate context into the word embeddings. One such attempt is the use of character-level representations as input to a convolutional neural network (CNN), which produces a contextualized representation of each word that takes into account the word's characters and their order. The resulting representation is flexible and can accommodate differences in word form and morphology, as well as variations in word length. Another approach is to use a recurrent neural network (RNN) to process the word's characters over time, taking into account their sequential order. This results in a contextualized representation of the word that depends on its specific form and context.\n\nContextualized word representations have proven effective in various natural language processing tasks, such as language modeling, sentiment analysis, and named entity recognition. They have also been shown to improve performance in tasks that require understanding of complex linguistic phenomena, such as anaphora resolution and syntactic parsing. One advantage of contextualized representations is that they can capture fine-grained differences in word meaning and usage that are difficult to capture with static representations. This is particularly useful for words with multiple meanings or homonyms, as the context in which the word appears can provide important clues for disambiguation. Moreover, contextualized representations can adapt to the specific task and domain, allowing for more accurate and efficient learning.\n\nHowever, contextualized word representations also have some disadvantages. One challenge is the computational cost of generating and storing multiple representations for each word, which can increase the memory and processing requirements of NLP systems. Another challenge is the difficulty of interpreting and understanding the contextualized representations, which can make it hard to understand how the NLP system is making its decisions. Additionally, contextualized representations may not generalize well to new words or contexts that were not present in the training data, which can limit their applicability and robustness.\n\n## Ethical considerations\n\nThe use of word embeddings in natural language processing (NLP) has raised concerns about the potential amplification of existing societal biases and discrimination. Word embeddings are trained on large corpora of text data, which may reflect the biases and stereotypes present in human language and culture. These biases can be embedded in the word embeddings, causing NLP systems to exhibit biased behavior towards certain groups of people.\n\nFor example, a study found that word embeddings trained on popular news sources contained biases against women, associating them more strongly with the word \"homework\" and linking them to occupational categories like \"secretary\" or \"homemaker.\" Another study showed that image captions containing black-sounding names were less likely to be associated with positive adjectives like \"happy\" or \"smiling,\" suggesting a bias against black individuals.\n\nThese biases can have serious consequences in various applications of NLP, such as search engines, chatbots, and automated content moderation systems. Biased word embeddings can lead to unfair treatment of individuals or groups based on characteristics such as race, gender, age, or socioeconomic status. For instance, a chatbot powered by biased word embeddings may provide different responses to similar questions asked by users of different genders or races, leading to unequal experiences and potentially discriminatory outcomes.\n\nTo address these concerns, researchers have proposed various methods for detecting and mitigating biases in word embeddings. One approach is to compute bias similarity scores between pairs of words along different dimensions, such as gender or race, using a method called BiasMap. Another approach is to modify the training process of word embeddings to minimize unwanted correlations between words while preserving semantic information. Furthermore, post-hoc debiasing techniques have been developed to remove or reduce biases from pre-trained word embeddings without retraining from scratch.\n\nDespite these efforts, the problem of bias in word embeddings remains an active area of research in NLP. Addressing this issue requires a multi-faceted approach that involves improving data collection practices, developing more robust evaluation metrics, and incorporating diverse perspectives in the design and development of NLP systems. By acknowledging and addressing the potential for bias in word embeddings, we can work towards creating more equitable and trustworthy NLP systems that serve all members of society fairly and justly.\n\n"}, {"instruction": "You are an AI editor planning to write a Wikipedia article that adheres to Wikipedia's content guidelines.

It learns to represent text as a sequence of vectors using self-supervised learning. It uses the encoder-only transformer architecture. BERT dramatically improved the state-of-the-art for large language models. As of 2020, BERT is a ubiquitous baseline in natural language processing (NLP) experiments. \nBERT is trained by masked token prediction and next sentence prediction. As a result of this training process, BERT learns contextual, latent representations of tokens in their context, similar to ELMo and GPT-2. It found applications for many natural language processing tasks, such as coreference resolution and polysemy resolution. It is an evolutionary step over ELMo, and spawned the study of \"BERTology\", which attempts to interpret what is learned by BERT.\nBERT was originally implemented in the English language at two model sizes, BERTBASE (110 million parameters) and BERTLARGE (340 million parameters). Both were trained on the Toronto BookCorpus (800M words) and English Wikipedia  (2,500M words). The weights were released on GitHub. On March 11, 2020, 24 smaller models were released, the smallest being BERTTINY with just 4 million parameters.\nArchitecture\nBERT is an \"encoder-only\" transformer architecture. At a high level, BERT consists of 4 modules: \n\nTokenizer: This module converts a piece of English text into a sequence of integers (\"tokens\").\nEmbedding: This module converts the sequence of tokens into an array of real-valued vectors representing the tokens. It represents the conversion of discrete token types into a lower-dimensional Euclidean space.\nEncoder: a stack of Transformer blocks with self-attention, but without causal masking.\nTask head: This module converts the final representation vectors into one-hot encoded tokens again by producing a predicted probability distribution over the token types. It can be viewed as a simple decoder, decoding the latent representation into token types, or as an \"un-embedding layer\".\nThe task head is necessary for pre-training, but it is often unnecessary for so-called \"downstream tasks,\" such as question answering or sentiment classification. Instead, one removes the task head and replaces it with a newly initialized module suited for the task, and finetune the new module. The latent vector representation of the model is directly fed into this new module, allowing for sample-efficient transfer learning.\nEmbedding\nThis section describes the embedding used by BERTBASE. The other one, BERTLARGE, is similar, just larger.\nThe tokenizer of BERT is WordPiece, which is a sub-word strategy like byte pair encoding. Its vocabulary size is 30,000, and any token not appearing in its vocabulary is replaced by [UNK] (\"unknown\"). \n\nThe first layer is the embedding layer, which contains three components: token type embeddings, position embeddings, and segment type embeddings. \n\nToken type: The token type is a standard embedding layer, translating a one-hot vector into a dense vector based on its token type.\nPosition: The position embeddings are based on a token's position in the sequence. BERT uses absolute position embeddings, where each position in sequence is mapped to a real-valued vector. Each dimension of the vector consists of a sinusoidal function that takes the position in the sequence as input.\nSegment type: Using a vocabulary of just 0 or 1, this embedding layer produces a dense vector based on whether the token belongs to the first or second text segment in that input. In other words, type-1 tokens are all tokens that appear after the [SEP] special token. All prior tokens are type-0.\nThe three embedding vectors are added together representing the initial token representation as a function of these three pieces of information. After embedding, the vector representation is normalized using a LayerNorm operation, outputting a 768-dimensional vector for each input token. After this, the representation vectors are passed forward through 12 Transformer encoder blocks, and are decoded back to 30,000-dimensional vocabulary space using a basic affine transformation layer.\nArchitectural family\nThe encoder stack of BERT has 2 free parameters: \n  \n    \n      \n        L\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle L}\n  \n, the number of layers, and \n  \n    \n      \n        H\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle H}\n  \n, the hidden size. There are always \n  \n    \n      \n        H\n        \n          /\n        \n        64\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle H/64}\n  \n self-attention heads, and the feed-forward/filter size is always \n  \n    \n      \n        4\n        H\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 4H}\n  \n. By varying these two numbers, one obtains an entire family of BERT models.\nFor BERT\n\nthe feed-forward size and filter size are synonymous. Both of them denote the number of dimensions in the middle layer of the feed-forward network.\nthe hidden size and embedding size are synonymous. Both of them denote the number of real numbers used to represent a token.\nThe notation for encoder stack is written as L/H. For example, BERTBASE is written as 12L/768H, BERTLARGE as 24L/1024H, and BERTTINY as 2L/128H.\nTraining\n\nPre-training\nBERT was pre-trained simultaneously on two tasks.\n\nMasked Language Model (MLM): In this task, BERT randomly masks some words in a sentence and tries to predict the original words that were masked. For example, in the sentence \"The cat sat on the [MASK],\" BERT would need to predict \"mat.\" This helps BERT learn bidirectional context, meaning it understands the relationships between words not just from left to right or right to left but from both directions at the same time.\nNext Sentence Prediction (NSP): In this task, BERT is trained to predict whether one sentence logically follows another. For example, given two sentences, \"The cat sat on the mat.\" and \"It was a sunny day,\" BERT has to decide if the second sentence is a valid continuation of the first one. This helps BERT understand relationships between sentences, which is important for tasks like question answering or document classification.\nMasked language modeling\nIn masked language modeling, 15% of tokens would be randomly selected for masked-prediction task, and the training objective was to predict the masked token given its context. In more detail, the selected token is \n\nreplaced with a [MASK] token with probability 80%,\nreplaced with a random word token with probability 10%,\nnot replaced with probability 10%.\nThe reason not all selected tokens are masked is to avoid the dataset shift problem. The dataset shift problem arises when the distribution of inputs seen during training differs significantly from the distribution encountered during inference. A trained BERT model might be applied to word representation (like Word2Vec), where it would be run over sentences not containing any [MASK] tokens. It is later found that more diverse training objectives are generally better.\nAs an illustrative example, consider the sentence \"my dog is cute\". It would first be divided into tokens like \"my1 dog2 is3 cute4\". Then a random token in the sentence would be picked. Let it be the 4th one \"cute4\". Next, there would be three possibilities:\n\nwith probability 80%, the chosen token is masked, resulting in \"my1 dog2 is3 [MASK]4\";\nwith probability 10%, the chosen token is replaced by a uniformly sampled random token, such as \"happy\", resulting in \"my1 dog2 is3 happy4\";\nwith probability 10%, nothing is done, resulting in \"my1 dog2 is3 cute4\".\nAfter processing the input text, the model's 4th output vector is passed to its decoder layer, which outputs a probability distribution over its 30,000-dimensional vocabulary space.\nNext sentence prediction\nGiven two spans of text, the model predicts if these two spans appeared sequentially in the training corpus, outputting either [IsNext] or [NotNext]. The first span starts with a special token [CLS] (for \"classify\"). The two spans are separated by a special token [SEP] (for \"separate\"). After processing the two spans, the 1-st output vector (the vector coding for [CLS]) is passed to a separate neural network for the binary classification into [IsNext] and [NotNext].\n\nFor example, given \"[CLS] my dog is cute [SEP] he likes playing\" the model should output token [IsNext].\nGiven \"[CLS] my dog is cute [SEP] how do magnets work\" the model should output token [NotNext].\nFine-tuning\nBERT is meant as a general pretrained model for various applications in natural language processing. That is, after pre-training, BERT can be fine-tuned with fewer resources on smaller datasets to optimize its performance on specific tasks such as natural language inference and text classification, and sequence-to-sequence-based language generation tasks such as question answering and conversational response generation.\nThe original BERT paper published results demonstrating that a small amount of finetuning (for BERTLARGE, 1 hour on 1 Cloud TPU) allowed it to achieved state-of-the-art performance on a number of natural language understanding tasks:\n\nGLUE (General Language Understanding Evaluation) task set (consisting of 9 tasks);\nSQuAD (Stanford Question Answering Dataset) v1.1 and v2.0;\nSWAG (Situations With Adversarial Generations).\nIn the original paper, all parameters of BERT are finetuned, and recommended that, for downstream applications that are text classifications, the output token at the [CLS] input token is fed into a linear-softmax layer to produce the label outputs.\nThe original code base defined the final linear layer as a \"pooler layer\", in analogy with global pooling in computer vision, even though it simply discards all output tokens except the one corresponding to  [CLS] .\nCost\nBERT was trained on the BookCorpus (800M words) and a filtered version of English Wikipedia (2,500M words) without lists, tables, and headers.\nTraining BERTBASE  on 4 cloud TPU (16 TPU chips total) took 4 days, at an estimated cost of 500 USD. Training BERTLARGE on 16 cloud TPU (64 TPU chips total) took 4 days.\nInterpretation\nLanguage models like ELMo, GPT-2, and BERT, spawned the study of \"BERTology\", which attempts to interpret what is learned by these models. Their performance on these natural language understanding tasks are not yet well understood. Several research publications in 2018 and 2019 focused on investigating the relationship behind BERT's output as a result of carefully chosen input sequences, analysis of internal vector representations through probing classifiers, and the relationships represented by attention weights.\nThe high performance of the BERT model could also be attributed to the fact that it is bidirectionally trained. This means that BERT, based on the Transformer model architecture, applies its self-attention mechanism to learn information from a text from the left and right side during training, and consequently gains a deep understanding of the context. For example, the word fine can have two different meanings depending on the context (I feel fine today, She has fine blond hair). BERT considers the words surrounding the target word fine from the left and right side.\nHowever it comes at a cost: due to encoder-only architecture lacking a decoder, BERT can't be prompted and can't generate text, while bidirectional models in general do not work effectively without the right side, thus being difficult to prompt. As an illustrative example, if one wishes to use BERT to continue a sentence fragment \"Today, I went to\", then naively one would mask out all the tokens as \"Today, I went to  [MASK]  [MASK]  [MASK] ...  [MASK] .\" where the number of  [MASK]  is the length of the sentence one wishes to extend to. However, this constitutes a dataset shift, as during training, BERT has never seen sentences with that many tokens masked out. Consequently, its performance degrades. More sophisticated techniques allow text generation, but at a high computational cost.\nHistory\nBERT was originally published by Google researchers Jacob Devlin, Ming-Wei Chang, Kenton Lee, and Kristina Toutanova. The design has its origins from pre-training contextual representations, including semi-supervised sequence learning, generative pre-training, ELMo, and ULMFit. Unlike previous models, BERT is a deeply bidirectional, unsupervised language representation, pre-trained using only a plain text corpus. Context-free models such as word2vec or GloVe generate a single word embedding representation for each word in the vocabulary, whereas BERT takes into account the context for each occurrence of a given word. For instance, whereas the vector for \"running\" will have the same word2vec vector representation for both of its occurrences in the sentences \"He is running a company\" and \"He is running a marathon\", BERT will provide a contextualized embedding that will be different according to the sentence.\nOn October 25, 2019, Google announced that they had started applying BERT models for English language search queries within the US. On December 9, 2019, it was reported that BERT had been adopted by Google Search for over 70 languages. In October 2020, almost every single English-based query was processed by a BERT model.\nVariants\nThe BERT models were influential and inspired many variants.\nRoBERTa (2019) was an engineering improvement. It preserves BERT's architecture (slightly larger, at 355M parameters), but improves its training, changing key hyperparameters, removing the next-sentence prediction task, and using much larger mini-batch sizes. \nDistilBERT (2019) distills BERTBASE to a model with just 60% of its parameters (66M), while preserving 95% of its benchmark scores. Similarly, TinyBERT (2019) is a distilled model with just 28% of its parameters.\nALBERT (2019) used shared-parameter across layers, and experimented with independently varying the hidden size and the word-embedding layer's output size as two hyperparameters. They also replaced the next sentence prediction task with the sentence-order prediction (SOP) task, where the model must distinguish the correct order of two consecutive text segments from their reversed order. \nELECTRA (2020) applied the idea of generative adversarial networks to the MLM task. Instead of masking out tokens, a small language model generates random plausible substitutions, and a larger network identify these replaced tokens. The small model aims to fool the large model.\nDeBERTa (2020) is a significant architectural variant, with disentangled attention. Its key idea is to treat the positional and token encodings separately throughout the attention mechanism. Instead of combining the positional encoding (\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          x\n          \n            p\n            o\n            s\n            i\n            t\n            i\n            o\n            n\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x_{position}}\n  \n) and token encoding (\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          x\n          \n            token\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x_{\\text{token}}}\n  \n) into a single input vector (\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          x\n          \n            i\n            n\n            p\n            u\n            t\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          x\n          \n            p\n            o\n            s\n            i\n            t\n            i\n            o\n            n\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          x\n          \n            t\n            o\n            k\n            e\n            n\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x_{input}=x_{position}+x_{token}}\n  \n), DeBERTa keeps them separate as a tuple: (\n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        \n          x\n          \n            p\n            o\n            s\n            i\n            t\n            i\n            o\n            n\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          x\n          \n            t\n            o\n            k\n            e\n            n\n          \n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (x_{position},x_{token})}\n  \n).

BERT is based on the transformer attention mechanism and was pre-trained using two unsupervised learning techniques on a corpus comprising 2,500 billion tokens from the English Wikipedia and 384 billion tokens from Google Books. BERT's self-supervised pre-training approach resulted in the model learning general-purpose language understanding. The model outperformed the state-of-the-art on the General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) benchmark by 8.0 points and on the Natural Language inference (NLI) task by 11.0 points.\n\n## Architecture\n\nBERT is based on the transformer attention mechanism, which was introduced in the original transformer paper. Transformers are a type of sequence model that avoids the complexity of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) by utilizing attention mechanisms. Attention allows the model to focus on different parts of the input when generating each part of the output. This is similar to how human-like intelligence focuses on different parts of their surroundings when focusing on a particular task.\n\nUnlike other models such as RNNs that process sequences in a sequential manner, the transformer uses self-attention to generate representations of the inputs. These representations can be thought of as a weighted version of the entire input sequence, where the weights represent the importance of each token in the sequence. Other models using attention, such as the original attention-based encoder\u2013decoder, utilize a similar method.\n\nThe BERT model consists of an encoder stack of transformer attention layers, along with embedding layers for tokens, positions, and segments. BERT utilizes the same embedding layers for both the encoder and decoder, allowing the model to understand context without requiring a decoder.\n\n### Pre-training\n\nBERT was pre-trained using two unsupervised learning objectives on a large corpus of unlabeled data: Masked LM and Next Sentence Prediction.\n\nThe Masked Language Model objective is designed to teach BERT to understand the relationships between words by predicting the contents of masked words within sentences. In this objective, a significant proportion of the input tokens are randomly masked, and the model is trained to predict what these masked values should be based on the context provided by the unmasked tokens. Specifically, during the training process, 15% of the tokens are masked, and the model is trained to predict what these tokens should be based on the context provided by the unmasked tokens. The masking process follows a specific pattern, where 80% of the time, the model is trained to predict the original tokens, 10% of the time, the masked tokens are replaced with a [MASK] token, and 10% of the time, the masked tokens are replaced with random tokens. This objective is based on the observation that a significant amount of information can be inferred from the context in which words are used. By training the model to predict masked words based on their context, BERT learns to understand the relationships between words and how they co-occur in sentences.\n\nIn the Next Sentence Prediction objective, consecutive sentences from the corpus are fed into two separate BERT encoders. The first encoder processes the first sentence, and the second encoder processes the second sentence. A classification token, [CLS], is added to the output of the first encoder, and a classification-specific layer is used to predict whether the second sentence is the next sentence in the original document or a randomly selected alternative sentence. The purpose of this objective is to teach the model to understand relationships between sentences, such as identifying whether two sentences are consecutive or not. This helps the model learn how sentences are related to each other in a paragraph or document, improving its ability to understand the context and structure of text.\n\n### Training\n\nThe BERT model was trained on 16 TPUv2 chips and took approximately 3 days to complete. The training data consisted of two corpora: the English Wikipedia and Google Books Ngrams. The English Wikipedia provided a diverse range of texts covering many topics, while the Google Books Ngrams corpus contained more informal and conversational language, which made the model more robust to variations in language usage.\n\nThe training process utilized two distinct datasets and corresponding pre-training tasks.\n\n**Dataset 1: English Wikipedia**\n\nThe first dataset utilized for pre-training BERT was derived from the English Wikipedia. The dataset was constructed by creating pairs of consecutive sentences from the Wikipedia text. For example, if the Wikipedia page on apples contained the sentences \"Apples are good for your health\" and \"They contain vitamins and minerals\", these would be split into two documents and paired as consecutive sentences.\n\nThe BERT model was then pre-trained on this dataset using two tasks: the Masked Language Modeling (MLM) task and the Next Sentence Prediction (NSP) task.\n\nIn the MLM task, a portion of the words in the sentences were masked, and the model was trained to predict the original words based on the context provided by the unmasked words. This helped the model learn the relationships between words and their contexts.\n\nIn the NSP task, the model was trained to distinguish between consecutive sentences and random sentence pairs. A sentence pair (A, B) was interpreted as consecutive sentences if they came from the same Wikipedia article, otherwise, they were considered random. The model was trained to predict whether pair (A, B) was consecutive or not. This task helped the model learn to understand the relationships between sentences and how they relate to each other in a broader context.\n\nTogether, the MLM and NSP tasks helped the BERT model learn to understand the structure and meaning of text by analyzing the relationships between words and sentences in the English Wikipedia.\n\n**Dataset 2: Google Books Ngrams**\n\nThe second dataset utilized for pre-training BERT was derived from the Google Books Ngrams corpus. This dataset consisted of a large amount of text from various books and sources on the Internet, providing a diverse range of text samples.\n\nThe BERT model was then pre-trained on this dataset using the Masked Language Modeling (MLM) task. In the MLM task, a portion of the words in the text were masked, and the model was trained to predict the original words based on the context provided by the surrounding words. This helped the model learn the relationships between words and their contexts.\n\nOverall, the pre-training of the BERT model on these two datasets helped it develop a strong understanding of the structure and meaning of text, enabling it to perform well on a variety of natural language processing tasks.\n\n## Applications\n\nSince its introduction in 2018, the BERT model has become one of the most widely used and influential models in the field of natural language processing (NLP). Its impact can be seen in a wide range of applications across various industries, including finance, healthcare, marketing, and customer service.\n\nOne of the key areas where BERT has made a significant impact is in sentiment analysis. BERT's deep understanding of language allows it to accurately analyze the sentiment of text, helping businesses better understand customer opinions and preferences. For example, BERT can be used to analyze product reviews, social media posts, and survey responses to gain insights into how customers feel about a particular product or service.\n\nIn the field of medicine, BERT has shown great promise in improving patient outcomes and reducing costs. For instance, BERT can be used to analyze electronic health records (EHRs) and identify patients who are at risk of developing certain conditions. This allows healthcare providers to take proactive measures to prevent or manage these conditions, leading to better health outcomes for patients and reduced healthcare costs for individuals and society as a whole.\n\nBERT has also been applied in the legal industry, where it has been used to improve legal research and contract analysis. By leveraging BERT's deep understanding of language, lawyers can quickly and easily find relevant case law and statutes, improving the efficiency and effectiveness of their research. Additionally, BERT can be used to analyze legal contracts and identify potential issues or areas of risk, helping lawyers provide better advice to their clients.\n\nFurthermore, BERT has been used in the financial industry for fraud detection and credit risk assessment. By analyzing large amounts of financial data, BERT can identify patterns and anomalies that may indicate fraudulent behavior or high-risk borrowers, helping financial institutions make more informed decisions and protect themselves from financial loss.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the many applications of BERT. As the model continues to be refined and improved, we can expect to see even more innovative uses of BERT in the years to come, transforming the way we interact with and process language.\n\n## History\n\nThe BERT model was first introduced in the paper \"Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers\" in 2018 by Devlin, et al. Since then, there have been several improvements and extensions to the BERT architecture.\n\n### BERT Large\n\nShortly after the original BERT paper was released, Google released a larger version of the BERT model with 340 million parameters. This larger model was trained on 16 TPU v3 chips for 40 days, resulting in a model that is much larger and more complex than the original BERT model.\n\n### RoBERTa\n\nIn July 2019, a research team at Facebook AI released RoBERTa, a retrained version of BERT with several key modifications. The RoBERTa model was trained using the same approach as BERT, but with some important changes. First, the model was trained for longer, which allowed it to learn more from the data. Second, the maximum sequence length was increased, which allowed the model to process longer and more complex sentences. Third, the training data was expanded by including all English Wikipedia articles and the CommonCrawl corpus, which provided more data for the model to learn from. Finally, the RoBERTa model did not use the next sentence prediction objective during pretraining, which allowed the model to focus on other aspects of language understanding.\n\n### ALBERT\n\nIn October 2019, a team of researchers from Google AI introduced ALBERT (Arxiv), a compact version of the BERT model. ALBERT is designed to provide comparable performance to the original BERT model while using fewer parameters. To achieve this, the ALBERT model uses a technique called factorization, which reduces the number of parameters in the embedding layer. In addition, the ALBERT model uses a shared parameter vector for the position encoding and segment encoding, further reducing the number of parameters. Despite its smaller size, the ALBERT model has been shown to achieve similar performance to the original BERT model on a variety of natural language processing tasks.\n\n### Megatron-BERT\n\nMegatron-BERT is a large-scale language model that was developed using the BERT architecture. It is known for its use of deep learning and attention mechanisms to achieve state-of-the-art results on a range of natural language understanding tasks. Megatron-BERT is particularly notable for its use of large-scale parallelization techniques, which allow it to train models with over 100 billion parameters. This level of scalability enables Megatron-BERT to achieve greater accuracy and better performance than smaller models. Overall, Megatron-BERT represents a significant advancement in the field of natural language processing and has the potential to revolutionize the way that machines understand and process human language.\n\n### ELECTRA\n\nELECTRA (Efficiently Learning an Encoder that Classifies Token Replacements Accurately) is a type of deep learning model for natural language processing (NLP) that is similar to the BERT model. Like BERT, ELECTRA is a pre-trained language model that can be fine-tuned for a wide range of NLP tasks. However, unlike BERT, which uses a technique called \"masked language modeling\" to learn the relationships between words, ELECTRA uses a method called \"discriminative pre-training\" that is designed to be more efficient and effective. In discriminative pre-training, ELECTRA is trained to identify and replace fake tokens in a sentence, which helps it to better understand the meaning and context of the words in the sentence. This approach has been shown to be more effective than the masked language modeling approach used by BERT, and as a result, ELECTRA models are often smaller and more efficient than equivalent BERT models while maintaining similar levels of accuracy.\n\n### Longformer\n\nLongformer is an extension of the BERT model that is designed to handle long sequences of text. Unlike BERT, which is limited to processing sequences of a fixed length, Longformer uses a technique called \"clustering\" to group together words that are closely related in meaning and then only attends to the clusters rather than every individual word. This allows the model to effectively process sequences that are much longer than those it was originally trained on. In addition, Longformer incorporates a \"convolutional\" mechanism that allows it to capture local dependencies in the text, which can be useful for tasks such as named entity recognition and part-of-speech tagging. Overall, Longformer represents a significant improvement over BERT for tasks that involve processing long documents or other extended text.\n\n## BERTology\n\nThe term BERTology refers to the study of BERT, a type of deep learning model for natural language processing (NLP). BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a pre-trained language model that has been shown to be effective for a wide range of NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis, question answering, and named entity recognition. BERTology encompasses a wide range of topics, including the design and training of BERT models, their limitations and biases, and their applications in different domains. One area of active research in BERTology is the development of methods for interpreting and explaining the predictions made by BERT models. This is an important area of research because BERT models are often seen as \"black boxes\" that are difficult to understand, which can make it challenging to trust and interpret their predictions. Another area of research in BERTology is the development of methods for adapting pre-trained BERT models to new tasks and domains. This is important because pre-trained BERT models are typically trained on large, general-purpose corpora, and may need to be adapted in order to perform well on specific tasks or for specific user groups. Overall, BERTology is an active area of research with many open questions and challenges.\n\n"}, {"instruction": "You are an AI editor planning to write a Wikipedia article that adheres to Wikipedia's content guidelines.

Text is converted to numerical representations called tokens, and each token is converted into a vector via lookup from a word embedding table. At each layer, each token is then contextualized within the scope of the context window with other (unmasked) tokens via a parallel multi-head attention mechanism, allowing the signal for key tokens to be amplified and less important tokens to be diminished.\nTransformers have the advantage of having no recurrent units, therefore requiring less training time than earlier recurrent neural architectures (RNNs) such as long short-term memory (LSTM). Later variations have been widely adopted for training large language models (LLM) on large (language) datasets.\n\nTransformers were first developed as an improvement over previous architectures for machine translation, but have found many applications since. They are used in large-scale natural language processing, computer vision (vision transformers), reinforcement learning, audio, multimodal learning, robotics, and even playing chess. It has also led to the development of pre-trained systems, such as generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs) and BERT (bidirectional encoder representations from transformers).\nHistory\n\nPredecessors\nFor many years, sequence modelling and generation was done by using plain recurrent neural networks (RNNs). A well-cited early example was the Elman network (1990). In theory, the information from one token can propagate arbitrarily far down the sequence, but in practice the vanishing-gradient problem leaves the model's state at the end of a long sentence without precise, extractable information about preceding tokens.\nA key breakthrough was LSTM (1995), a RNN which used various innovations to overcome the vanishing gradient problem, allowing efficient learning of long-sequence modelling. One key innovation was the use of an attention mechanism which used neurons that multiply the outputs of other neurons, so-called multiplicative units. Neural networks using multiplicative units were later called sigma-pi networks or higher-order networks. LSTM became the standard architecture for long sequence modelling until the 2017 publication of Transformers.\nHowever, LSTM still used sequential processing, like most other RNNs. Specifically, RNNs operate one token at a time from first to last; they cannot operate in parallel over all tokens in a sequence. \nModern Transformers overcome this problem, but unlike RNNs, they require computation time that is quadratic in the size of the context window. The linearly scaling fast weight controller (1992) learns to compute a weight matrix for further processing depending on the input. One of its two networks has \"fast weights\" or \"dynamic links\" (1981). A slow neural network learns by gradient descent to generate keys and values for computing the weight changes of the fast neural network which computes answers to queries. This was later shown to be equivalent to the unnormalized linear Transformer.\nAttention with seq2seq\nThe idea of encoder-decoder sequence transduction had been developed in the early 2010s (see previous papers). The papers most commonly cited as the originators that produced seq2seq are two concurrently published papers from 2014.\nA 380M-parameter model for machine translation uses two long short-term memories (LSTM). Its architecture consists of two parts. The encoder is an LSTM that takes in a sequence of tokens and turns it into a vector. The decoder is another LSTM that converts the vector into a sequence of tokens. Similarly, another 130M-parameter model used gated recurrent units (GRU) instead of LSTM. Later research showed that GRUs are neither better nor worse than LSTMs for seq2seq.\nThese early seq2seq models had no attention mechanism, and the state vector is accessible only after the last word of the source text was processed. Although in theory such a vector retains the information about the whole original sentence, in practice the information is poorly preserved. This is because the input is processed sequentially by one recurrent network into a fixed-size output vector, which is then processed by another recurrent network into an output. If the input is long, then the output vector would not be able to contain all relevant information, degrading the output. As evidence, reversing the input sentence improved seq2seq translation.\nThe RNNsearch model introduced an attention mechanism to seq2seq for machine translation to solve the bottleneck problem (of the fixed-size output vector), allowing the model to process long-distance dependencies more easily. The name is because it \"emulates searching through a source sentence during decoding a translation\".\nThe relative performances were compared between global (that of RNNsearch) and local (sliding window) attention model architectures for machine translation, finding that mixed attention had higher quality than global attention, while local attention reduced translation time.\nIn 2016, Google Translate was revamped to Google Neural Machine Translation, which replaced the previous model based on statistical machine translation. The new model was a seq2seq model where the encoder and the decoder were both 8 layers of bidirectional LSTM. It took nine months to develop, and it outperformed the statistical approach, which took ten years to develop.\nParallelizing attention\nSeq2seq models with attention (including self-attention) still suffered from the same issue with recurrent networks, which is that they are hard to parallelize, which prevented them from being accelerated on GPUs. In 2016, decomposable attention applied a self-attention mechanism to feedforward networks, which are easy to parallelize, and achieved SOTA result in textual entailment with an order of magnitude fewer parameters than LSTMs. One of its authors, Jakob Uszkoreit, suspected that attention without recurrence is sufficient for language translation, thus the title \"attention is all you need\". That hypothesis was against conventional wisdom at the time, and even his father Hans Uszkoreit, a well-known computational linguist, was skeptical. In the same year, self-attention (called intra-attention or intra-sentence attention) was proposed for LSTMs.\nIn 2017, the original (100M-sized) encoder-decoder transformer model was proposed in the \"Attention is all you need\" paper. At the time, the focus of the research was on improving seq2seq for machine translation, by removing its recurrence to process all tokens in parallel, but preserving its dot-product attention mechanism to keep its text processing performance. This led to the introduction of a multi-head attention model that was easier to parallelize due to the use of independent heads and the lack of recurrence. Its parallelizability was an important factor to its widespread use in large neural networks.\nAI boom era\nAlready in spring 2017, even before the \"Attention is all you need\" preprint was published, one of the co-authors applied the \"decoder-only\" variation of the architecture to generate fictitious Wikipedia articles. Transformer architecture is now used alongside many generative models that contribute to the ongoing AI boom.\nIn language modelling, ELMo (2018) was a bi-directional LSTM that produces contextualized word embeddings, improving upon the line of research from bag of words and word2vec. It was followed by BERT (2018), an encoder-only Transformer model. In 2019 October, Google started using BERT to process search queries. In 2020, Google Translate replaced the previous RNN-encoder\u2013RNN-decoder model by a Transformer-encoder\u2013RNN-decoder model.\nStarting in 2018, the OpenAI GPT series of decoder-only Transformers became state of the art in natural language generation. In 2022, a chatbot based on GPT-3, ChatGPT, became unexpectedly popular, triggering a boom around large language models.\nSince 2020, Transformers have been applied in modalities beyond text, including the vision transformer, speech recognition, robotics, and multimodal. The vision transformer, in turn, stimulated new developments in convolutional neural networks. Image and video generators like DALL-E (2021), Stable Diffusion 3 (2024), and Sora (2024), use Transformers to analyse input data (like text prompts) by breaking it down into \"tokens\" and then calculating the relevance between each token using self-attention, which helps the model understand the context and relationships within the data.\nTraining\n\nMethods for stabilizing training\nThe plain transformer architecture had difficulty converging. In the original paper the authors recommended using learning rate warmup. That is, the learning rate should linearly scale up from 0 to maximal value for the first part of the training (usually recommended to be 2% of the total number of training steps), before decaying again.\nA 2020 paper found that using layer normalization before (instead of after) multiheaded attention and feedforward layers stabilizes training, not requiring learning rate warmup.\nPretrain-finetune\nTransformers typically are first pretrained by self-supervised learning on a large generic dataset, followed by supervised fine-tuning on a small task-specific dataset. The pretrain dataset is typically an unlabeled large corpus, such as The Pile. Tasks for pretraining and fine-tuning commonly include:\n\nlanguage modeling\nnext-sentence prediction\nquestion answering\nreading comprehension\nsentiment analysis\nparaphrasing\nThe T5 transformer report documents a large number of natural language pretraining tasks. Some examples are:\n\nrestoring or repairing incomplete or corrupted text. For example, the input, \"Thank you\u202f~~\u202fme to your party\u202f~~\u202fweek\", might generate the output, \"Thank you for inviting me to your party last week\".\ntranslation between natural languages (machine translation)\njudging the pragmatic acceptability of natural language. For example, the following sentence might be judged \"not acceptable\", because even though it is syntactically well-formed, it is improbable in ordinary human usage: The course is jumping well.\nNote that while each of these tasks is trivial or obvious for human native speakers of the language (or languages), they have typically proved challenging for previous generations of machine learning architecture.\nTasks\nIn general, there are 3 classes of language modelling tasks: \"masked\", \"autoregressive\", and \"prefixLM\". These classes are independent of a specific modeling architecture such as Transformer, but they are often discussed in the context of Transformer.\nIn a masked task, one or more of the tokens is masked out, and the model would produce a probability distribution predicting what the masked-out tokens are based on the context. The loss function for the task is typically sum of log-perplexities for the masked-out tokens: \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          Loss\n        \n        =\n        \u2212\n        \n          \u2211\n          \n            t\n            \u2208\n            \n              masked tokens\n            \n          \n        \n        ln\n        \u2061\n        (\n        \n          probability of \n        \n        t\n        \n           conditional on its context\n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\text{Loss}}=-\\sum _{t\\in {\\text{masked tokens}}}\\ln({\\text{probability of }}t{\\text{ conditional on its context}})}\n  \nand the model is trained to minimize this loss function. The BERT series of models are trained for masked token prediction and another task.\nIn an autoregressive task, the entire sequence is masked at first, and the model produces a probability distribution for the first token. Then the first token is revealed and the model predicts the second token, and so on. The loss function for the task is still typically the same. The GPT series of models are trained by autoregressive tasks.\nIn a prefixLM task, the sequence is divided into two parts. The first part is presented as context, and the model predicts the first token of the second part. Then that would be revealed, and the model predicts the second token, and so on. The loss function for the task is still typically the same. The T5 series of models are trained by prefixLM tasks.\nNote that \"masked\" as in \"masked language modelling\" is not \"masked\" as in \"masked attention\", and \"prefixLM\" (prefix language modeling) is not \"prefixLM\" (prefix language model).\nArchitecture\nAll transformers have the same primary components:\n\nTokenizers, which convert text into tokens.\nEmbedding layer, which converts tokens and positions of the tokens into vector representations.\nTransformer layers, which carry out repeated transformations on the vector representations, extracting more and more linguistic information. These consist of alternating attention and feedforward layers. There are two major types of transformer layers: encoder layers and decoder layers, with further variants.\nUn-embedding layer, which converts the final vector representations back to a probability distribution over the tokens.\nThe following description follows exactly the Transformer as described in the original paper. There are variants, described in the following section.\nBy convention, we write all vectors as row vectors. This, for example, means that pushing a vector through a linear layer means multiplying it by a weight matrix on the right, as \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n        W\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle xW}\n  \n.\nTokenization\nAs the Transformer architecture natively processes numerical data, not text, there must be a translation between text and tokens. A token is an integer that represents a character, or a short segment of characters. On the input side, the input text is parsed into a token sequence. Similarly, on the output side, the output tokens are parsed back to text. The module doing the conversion between texts and token sequences is a tokenizer.\nThe set of all tokens is the vocabulary of the tokenizer, and its size is the vocabulary size \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          n\n          \n            vocabulary\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n_{\\text{vocabulary}}}\n  \n. When faced with tokens outside the vocabulary, typically a special token is used, written as \"[UNK]\" for \"unknown\".\nSome commonly used tokenizers are byte pair encoding, WordPiece, and SentencePiece.\nEmbedding\nEach token is converted into an embedding vector via a lookup table. Equivalently stated, it multiplies a one-hot representation of the token by an embedding matrix \n  \n    \n      \n        M\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle M}\n  \n. For example, if the input token is \n  \n    \n      \n        3\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 3}\n  \n, then the one-hot representation is \n  \n    \n      \n        [\n        0\n        ,\n        0\n        ,\n        0\n        ,\n        1\n        ,\n        0\n        ,\n        0\n        ,\n        \u2026\n        ]\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle [0,0,0,1,0,0,\\dots ]}\n  \n, and its embedding vector is\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          E\n          m\n          b\n          e\n          d\n        \n        (\n        3\n        )\n        =\n        [\n        0\n        ,\n        0\n        ,\n        0\n        ,\n        1\n        ,\n        0\n        ,\n        0\n        ,\n        \u2026\n        ]\n        M\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {Embed} (3)=[0,0,0,1,0,0,\\dots ]M}\n  \nThe token embedding vectors are added to their respective positional encoding vectors (see below), producing the sequence of input vectors. \nThe number of dimensions in an embedding vector is called hidden size or embedding size and written as \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          d\n          \n            emb\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle d_{\\text{emb}}}\n  \n. This size is written as \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          d\n          \n            model\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle d_{\\text{model}}}\n  \n in the original Transformer paper.\nUn-embedding\nAn un-embedding layer is almost the reverse of an embedding layer. Whereas an embedding layer converts a token into a vector, an un-embedding layer converts a vector into a probability distribution over tokens.\nThe un-embedding layer is a linear-softmax layer:\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          U\n          n\n          E\n          m\n          b\n          e\n          d\n        \n        (\n        x\n        )\n        =\n        \n          s\n          o\n          f\n          t\n          m\n          a\n          x\n        \n        (\n        x\n        W\n        +\n        b\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {UnEmbed} (x)=\\mathrm {softmax} (xW+b)}\n  \nThe matrix has shape \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        \n          d\n          \n            emb\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          n\n          \n            vocabulary\n          \n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (d_{\\text{emb}},n_{\\text{vocabulary}})}\n  \n. The embedding matrix \n  \n    \n      \n        M\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle M}\n  \n and the un-embedding matrix \n  \n    \n      \n        W\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle W}\n  \n are sometimes required to be transposes of each other, a practice called weight tying.\nPositional encoding\nA positional encoding is a fixed-size vector representation of the relative positions of tokens within a sequence: it provides the transformer model with information about where the words are in the input sequence. This shall induce a bias towards the order of the input sequence, so that, for example, the input sequence \"man bites dog\" is processed differently from \"dog bites man\".\nThe positional encoding is defined as a function of type \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        :\n        \n          R\n        \n        \u2192\n        \n          \n            R\n          \n          \n            d\n          \n        \n        ;\n        d\n        \u2208\n        \n          Z\n        \n        ,\n        d\n        >\n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f:\\mathbb {R} \\to \\mathbb {R} ^{d};d\\in \\mathbb {Z} ,d>0}\n  \n, where \n  \n    \n      \n        d\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle d}\n  \n is a positive even integer.

This allows the transformer to take any encoded position, and find the encoding of the position n-steps-ahead or n-steps-behind, by a matrix multiplication.\nBy taking a linear sum, any convolution can also be implemented as linear transformations:\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \u2211\n          \n            j\n          \n        \n        \n          c\n          \n            j\n          \n        \n        f\n        (\n        t\n        +\n        \u0394\n        \n          t\n          \n            j\n          \n        \n        )\n        =\n        \n          (\n          \n            \n              \u2211\n              \n                j\n              \n            \n            \n              c\n              \n                j\n              \n            \n            \n            \n              d\n              i\n              a\n              g\n            \n            (\n            f\n            (\n            \u0394\n            \n              t\n              \n                j\n              \n            \n            )\n            )\n          \n          )\n        \n        f\n        (\n        t\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\sum _{j}c_{j}f(t+\\Delta t_{j})=\\left(\\sum _{j}c_{j}\\,\\mathrm {diag} (f(\\Delta t_{j}))\\right)f(t)}\n  \nfor any constants \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          c\n          \n            j\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle c_{j}}\n  \n. This allows the transformer to take any encoded position and find a linear sum of the encoded locations of its neighbors. This sum of encoded positions, when fed into the attention mechanism, would create attention weights on its neighbors, much like what happens in a convolutional neural network language model. In the author's words, \"we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by relative position.\"\nIn typical implementations, all operations are done over the real numbers, not the complex numbers, but since complex multiplication can be implemented as real 2-by-2 matrix multiplication, this is a mere notational difference.\nEncoder-decoder (overview)\nLike earlier seq2seq models, the original transformer model used an encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder consists of encoding layers that process all the input tokens together one layer after another, while the decoder consists of decoding layers that iteratively process the encoder's output and the decoder's output tokens so far.\nThe purpose of each encoder layer is to create contextualized representations of the tokens, where each representation corresponds to a token that \"mixes\" information from other input tokens via self-attention mechanism. Each decoder layer contains two attention sublayers: (1) cross-attention for incorporating the output of encoder (contextualized input token representations), and (2) self-attention for \"mixing\" information among the input tokens to the decoder (i.e. the tokens generated so far during inference time).\nBoth the encoder and decoder layers have a feed-forward neural network for additional processing of their outputs and contain residual connections and layer normalization steps. These feed-forward layers contain most of the parameters in a Transformer model.\nFeedforward network\nThe feedforward network (FFN) modules in a Transformer are 2-layered multilayer perceptrons:\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          F\n          F\n          N\n        \n        (\n        x\n        )\n        =\n        \u03d5\n        (\n        x\n        \n          W\n          \n            (\n            1\n            )\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          b\n          \n            (\n            1\n            )\n          \n        \n        )\n        \n          W\n          \n            (\n            2\n            )\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          b\n          \n            (\n            2\n            )\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {FFN} (x)=\\phi (xW^{(1)}+b^{(1)})W^{(2)}+b^{(2)}}\n  \nwhere \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          W\n          \n            (\n            1\n            )\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle W^{(1)}}\n  \n and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          W\n          \n            (\n            2\n            )\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle W^{(2)}}\n  \n are weight matrices and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          b\n          \n            (\n            1\n            )\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle b^{(1)}}\n  \n and  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          b\n          \n            (\n            2\n            )\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle b^{(2)}}\n  \n are bias vectors, and \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03d5\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\phi }\n  \n is its activation function. The original Transformer used ReLU activation.\nThe number of neurons in the middle layer is called intermediate size (GPT), filter size (BERT), or feedforward size (BERT).

Meanwhile, the value projection matrix \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          W\n          \n            V\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle W^{V}}\n  \n, in combination with the part of the output projection matrix \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          W\n          \n            O\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle W^{O}}\n  \n, determines how the attended tokens influence what information is passed to subsequent layers and ultimately the output logits. In addition, the scope of attention, or the range of token relationships captured by each attention head, can expand as tokens pass through successive layers. This allows the model to capture more complex and long-range dependencies in deeper layers. Many transformer attention heads encode relevance relations that are meaningful to humans. For example, some attention heads can attend mostly to the next word, while others mainly attend from verbs to their direct objects. The computations for each attention head can be performed in parallel, which allows for fast processing. The outputs for the attention layer are concatenated to pass into the feed-forward neural network layers.\nConcretely, let the multiple attention heads be indexed by \n  \n    \n      \n        i\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i}\n  \n, then we have\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          MultiheadedAttention\n        \n        (\n        Q\n        ,\n        K\n        ,\n        V\n        )\n        =\n        \n          \n            Concat\n          \n          \n            i\n            \u2208\n            [\n            \n              n\n              \n                heads\n              \n            \n            ]\n          \n        \n        (\n        \n          Attention\n        \n        (\n        Q\n        \n          W\n          \n            i\n          \n          \n            Q\n          \n        \n        ,\n        K\n        \n          W\n          \n            i\n          \n          \n            K\n          \n        \n        ,\n        V\n        \n          W\n          \n            i\n          \n          \n            V\n          \n        \n        )\n        )\n        \n          W\n          \n            O\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\text{MultiheadedAttention}}(Q,K,V)={\\text{Concat}}_{i\\in [n_{\\text{heads}}]}({\\text{Attention}}(QW_{i}^{Q},KW_{i}^{K},VW_{i}^{V}))W^{O}}\n  \n where the matrix \n  \n    \n      \n        X\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle X}\n  \n is the concatenation of word embeddings, and the matrices \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          W\n          \n            i\n          \n          \n            Q\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          W\n          \n            i\n          \n          \n            K\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          W\n          \n            i\n          \n          \n            V\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle W_{i}^{Q},W_{i}^{K},W_{i}^{V}}\n  \n are \"projection matrices\" owned by individual attention head \n  \n    \n      \n        i\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i}\n  \n, and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          W\n          \n            O\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle W^{O}}\n  \n is a final projection matrix owned by the whole multi-headed attention head.\nIt is theoretically possible for each attention head to have a different head dimension \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          d\n          \n            head\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle d_{\\text{head}}}\n  \n, but that is rarely the case in practice.\nAs an example, in the smallest GPT-2 model, there are only self-attention mechanisms.

The first encoder layer takes the sequence of input vectors from the embedding layer, producing a sequence of vectors. This sequence of vectors is processed by the second encoder, and so on. The output from the final encoder layer is then used by the decoder.\nAs the encoder processes the entire input all at once, every token can attend to every other token (all-to-all attention), so there is no need for causal masking.\nDecoder\nA decoder consists of an embedding layer, followed by multiple decoder layers, followed by an un-embedding layer.\nEach decoder consists of three major components: a causally masked self-attention mechanism, a cross-attention mechanism, and a feed-forward neural network. The decoder functions in a similar fashion to the encoder, but an additional attention mechanism is inserted which instead draws relevant information from the encodings generated by the encoders. This mechanism can also be called the encoder-decoder attention.\nLike the first encoder, the first decoder takes positional information and embeddings of the output sequence as its input, rather than encodings. The transformer must not use the current or future output to predict an output, so the output sequence must be partially masked to prevent this reverse information flow. This allows for autoregressive text generation. For decoding, all-to-all attention is inappropriate, because a token cannot attend to tokens not yet generated. Thus, the self-attention module in the decoder is causally masked.\nIn contrast, the cross-attention mechanism attends to the output vectors of the encoder, which is computed before the decoder starts decoding. Consequently, there is no need for masking in the cross-attention mechanism.\nSchematically, we have:\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                \n                  H\n                  \u2032\n                \n              \n              \n                \n                =\n                \n                  MaskedMultiheadedAttention\n                \n                (\n                H\n                ,\n                H\n                ,\n                H\n                )\n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  DecoderLayer\n                \n                (\n                H\n                )\n              \n              \n                \n                =\n                \n                  FFN\n                \n                (\n                \n                  MultiheadedAttention\n                \n                (\n                \n                  H\n                  \u2032\n                \n                ,\n                \n                  H\n                  \n                    E\n                  \n                \n                ,\n                \n                  H\n                  \n                    E\n                  \n                \n                )\n                )\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\begin{aligned}H'&={\\text{MaskedMultiheadedAttention}}(H,H,H)\\\\{\\text{DecoderLayer}}(H)&={\\text{FFN}}({\\text{MultiheadedAttention}}(H',H^{E},H^{E}))\\end{aligned}}}\n  \nwhere \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          H\n          \n            E\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle H^{E}}\n  \n is the matrix with rows being the output vectors from the encoder.\nThe last decoder is followed by a final un-embedding layer. to produce the output probabilities over the vocabulary. Then, one of the tokens is sampled according to the probability, and the decoder can be run again to produce the next token, etc, autoregressively generating output text.\nAdapted architectures\nMany large language models, since they do not need to predict a whole new sequence from an input sequence, only use the encoder or decoder of the original transformer architecture. Early GPT models are decoder-only models trained to predict the next token in a sequence. BERT, another language model, only makes use of an encoder, and is trained to predict a randomly masked token in a sequence.\nFull transformer architecture\n\nSublayers\nEach encoder layer contains 2 sublayers: the self-attention and the feedforward network. Each decoder layer contains 3 sublayers: the causally masked self-attention, the cross-attention, and the feedforward network.\n\nThe final points of detail are the residual connections and layer normalization (LayerNorm, or LN), which while conceptually unnecessary, are necessary for numerical stability and convergence.  \nThe residual connection, which is introduced to avoid vanishing gradient issues and stabilize the training process, can be expressed as follows: y = F(x) + x. The expression indicates that an output y is the sum of the transformation of input x (F(x)) and the input itself (x). Adding the input x can preserve the input information and avoid issues when the gradient of F(x) is close to zero.  \nSimilarly to how the feedforward network modules are applied individually to each vector, the LayerNorm is also applied individually to each vector. \nThere are two common conventions in use: the post-LN and the pre-LN convention.

The pre-LN convention, proposed several times in 2018, was found to be easier to train, requiring no warm-up, leading to faster convergence.\nPseudocode\nThe following is the pseudocode for a standard pre-LN encoder-decoder Transformer, adapted from\n\ninput: Encoder input t_e\n       Decoder input t_d\noutput: Array of probability distributions, with shape (decoder vocabulary size x length(decoder output sequence))\n\n/* encoder */\nz_e \u2190 encoder.tokenizer(t_e)\n\nfor each t in 1:length(z_e) do\n    z_e[t] \u2190 encoder.embedding(z_e[t]) + encoder.positional_embedding(t)\n\nfor each l in 1:length(encoder.layers) do\n    layer \u2190 encoder.layers[l]\n\n    /* first sublayer */\n    z_e_copy \u2190 copy(z_e)\n    for each t in 1:length(z_e) do\n        z_e[t] \u2190 layer.layer_norm(z_e[t])\n    z_e \u2190 layer.multiheaded_attention(z_e, z_e, z_e)\n    for each t in 1:length(z_e) do\n        z_e[t] \u2190 z_e[t] + z_e_copy[t]\n\n    /* second sublayer */\n    z_e_copy \u2190 copy(z_e)\n    for each t in 1:length(z_e) do\n        z_e[t] \u2190 layer.layer_norm(z_e[t])\n    z_e \u2190 layer.feedforward(z_e)\n    for each t in 1:length(z_e) do\n        z_e[t] \u2190 z_e[t] + z_e_copy[t]\n\nfor each t in 1:length(z_e) do\n    z_e[t] \u2190 encoder.final_layer_norm(z_e[t])\n\n/* decoder */\nz_d \u2190 decoder.tokenizer(t_d)\n\nfor each t in 1:length(z_d) do\n    z_d[t] \u2190 decoder.embedding(z_d[t]) + decoder.positional_embedding(t)\n\nfor each l in 1:length(decoder.layers) do\n        layer \u2190 decoder.layers[l]\n\n        /* first sublayer */\n        z_d_copy \u2190 copy(z_d)\n        for each t in 1:length(z_d) do\n            z_d[t] \u2190 layer.layer_norm(z_d[t])\n        z_d \u2190 layer.masked_multiheaded_attention(z_d, z_d, z_d)\n        for each t in 1:length(z_d) do\n            z_d[t] \u2190 z_d[t] + z_d_copy[t]\n\n        /* second sublayer */\n        z_d_copy \u2190 copy(z_d)\n        for each t in 1:length(z_d) do\n            z_d[t] \u2190 layer.layer_norm(z_d[t])\n        z_d \u2190 layer.multiheaded_attention(z_d, z_e, z_e) \n        for each i in 1:length(z_d) do\n            z_d[t] \u2190 z_d[t] + z_d_copy[t]\n\n        /* third sublayer */\n        z_d_copy \u2190 copy(z_d)\n        for each t in 1:length(z_d) do\n            z_d[t] \u2190 layer.layer_norm(z_d[t])\n        z_d \u2190 layer.feedforward(z_d)\n        for each t in 1:length(z_d) do\n            z_d[t] \u2190 z_d[t] + z_d_copy[t]\n\nz_d \u2190 decoder.final_layer_norm(z_d)\n\noutput_distributions \u2190 []\nfor each t in 1:length(z_d) do\n    output_distributions.append(decoder.unembed(z_d[t]))\n\nreturn output_distributions\nTerminology\nThe Transformer architecture, being modular, allows variations. Several common variations are described here.\nAn \"encoder-only\" Transformer applies the encoder to map an input text into a sequence of vectors that represent the input text. This is usually used for text embedding and representation learning for downstream applications. BERT is encoder-only. They are less often used currently, as they were found to be not significantly better than training an encoder-decoder Transformer, then taking just the encoder.\nA \"decoder-only\" Transformer is not literally decoder-only, since without an encoder, the cross-attention mechanism has nothing to attend to. Thus, the decoder layers in a decoder-only Transformer is composed of just two sublayers: the causally masked self-attention, and the feedforward network. This is usually used for text generation and instruction following. The models in the GPT series and Chinchilla series are decoder-only.\nAn \"encoder-decoder\" Transformer is generally the same as the original Transformer, with 2 sublayers per encoder layer and 3 sublayers per decoder layer, etc. They might have minor architectural improvements, such as alternative activation functions, changing the location of normalization, etc. This is also usually used for text generation and instruction following. The models in the T5 series are encoder-decoder.\nA \"prefixLM\" (prefix language model) is a decoder-only architecture, but with prefix masking, which is different from causal masking. Specifically, it has mask of the form:\u200aFigure 3\u200a\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          M\n          \n            prefixLM\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            [\n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    0\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \u2212\n                  \u221e\n                \n              \n              \n                \n                  \n                    0\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    M\n                    \n                      causal\n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n            ]\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle M_{\\text{prefixLM}}={\\begin{bmatrix}\\mathbf {0} &-\\infty \\\\\\mathbf {0} &M_{\\text{causal}}\\end{bmatrix}}}\n  \nwhere the first columns correspond to the \"prefix\", and the subsequent columns correspond to the autoregressively generated text based on the prefix. They resemble encoder-decoder models, but has less \"sparsity\". Such models are rarely used, though they are cited as theoretical possibilities and benchmarked comparisons.\nThere are also mixed seq2seq models. For example, in 2020, Google Translate replaced the previous RNN-encoder\u2013RNN-decoder model by a Transformer-encoder\u2013RNN-decoder model, on the argument that an RNN-decoder runs much faster than Transformer-decoder when run autoregressively.\nSubsequent work\n\nAlternative activation functions\nThe original transformer uses ReLU activation function. Other activation functions were developed. The Llama series and PaLM used SwiGLU; both GPT-1 and BERT used GELU. \nAlternative activation functions are often used in combination with Gated Linear Units in the feedforward module.\nAlternative normalizations\nThe normalization used in the Transformer can be different from LayerNorm. One example is RMSNorm which is used in the Llama series. Other examples include CapsuleNorm ScaleNorm, or FixNorm.\nAlternative positional encodings\nTransformers may use other positional encoding methods than sinusoidal. \nThe original Transformer paper reported using a learned positional encoding, but finding it not superior to the sinusoidal one. Later,  found that causal masking itself provides enough signal to a Transformer decoder that it can learn to implicitly perform absolute positional encoding without the positional encoding module.\nRoPE\nRoPE (rotary positional embedding), is best explained by considering a list of 2-dimensional vectors \n  \n    \n      \n        [\n        (\n        \n          x\n          \n            1\n          \n          \n            (\n            1\n            )\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          x\n          \n            1\n          \n          \n            (\n            2\n            )\n          \n        \n        )\n        ,\n        (\n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n          \n            (\n            1\n            )\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n          \n            (\n            2\n            )\n          \n        \n        )\n        ,\n        (\n        \n          x\n          \n            3\n          \n          \n            (\n            1\n            )\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          x\n          \n            3\n          \n          \n            (\n            2\n            )\n          \n        \n        )\n        ,\n        .\n        .\n        .\n        ]\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle [(x_{1}^{(1)},x_{1}^{(2)}),(x_{2}^{(1)},x_{2}^{(2)}),(x_{3}^{(1)},x_{3}^{(2)}),...]}\n  \n.

Since it is directly plugged into the attention mechanism, it can be combined with any positional encoder that is plugged into the \"bottom\" of the entire network (which is where the sinusoidal encoder on the original transformer, as well as RoPE and many others, are located).\nRelative Position Encodings\nRelative Position Encodings is similar to ALiBi, but more generic:\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                \n                  Attention\n                \n                (\n                Q\n                ,\n                K\n                ,\n                V\n                )\n                =\n                \n                  softmax\n                \n                \n                  (\n                  \n                    \n                      \n                        \n                          Q\n                          \n                            K\n                            \n                              \n                                T\n                              \n                            \n                          \n                        \n                        \n                          \n                            d\n                            \n                              k\n                            \n                          \n                        \n                      \n                    \n                    +\n                    B\n                  \n                  )\n                \n                V\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\begin{aligned}{\\text{Attention}}(Q,K,V)={\\text{softmax}}\\left({\\frac {QK^{\\mathrm {T} }}{\\sqrt {d_{k}}}}+B\\right)V\\end{aligned}}}\n  \nwhere \n  \n    \n      \n        B\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle B}\n  \n is a Toeplitz matrix, that is, \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          B\n          \n            i\n            ,\n            j\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          B\n          \n            \n              i\n              \u2032\n            \n            ,\n            \n              j\n              \u2032\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle B_{i,j}=B_{i',j'}}\n  \n whenever \n  \n    \n      \n        i\n        \u2212\n        j\n        =\n        \n          i\n          \u2032\n        \n        \u2212\n        \n          j\n          \u2032\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i-j=i'-j'}\n  \n. This is contrasted with the original sinusoidal positional encoding, which is an \"absolute positional encoding\".\nEfficient implementation\nThe transformer model has been implemented in standard deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch. Transformers is a library produced by Hugging Face that supplies transformer-based architectures and pretrained models.\nKV caching\nWhen an autoregressive transformer is used for inference, such as generating text, the query vector is different at each step, but the already-computed key and value vectors are always the same. The KV caching method saves the computed key and value vectors at each attention block, so that they are not recomputed at each new token. PagedAttention applies memory paging to KV caching.\nIf a transformer is used with a baked-in prompt, such as [\"You are a customer support agent...\"], then the key and value vectors can be computed for the prompt, and saved on disk. The saving in compute is significant when the model is used for many short interactions, such as in online chatbots.\nFlashAttention\nFlashAttention is an algorithm that implements the transformer attention mechanism efficiently on a GPU. It is a communication-avoiding algorithm that performs matrix multiplications in blocks, such that each block fits within the cache of a GPU, and by careful management of the blocks it minimizes data copying between GPU caches (as data movement is slow). See the page on softmax for details.\nAn improved version, FlashAttention-2, was developed to cater to the rising demand for language models capable of handling longer context lengths. It offers enhancements in work partitioning and parallelism, enabling it to achieve up to 230 TFLOPs/s on A100 GPUs (FP16/BF16), a 2x speed increase over the original FlashAttention.\nKey advancements in FlashAttention-2 include the reduction of non-matmul FLOPs, improved parallelism over the sequence length dimension, better work partitioning between GPU warps, and added support for head dimensions up to 256 and multi-query attention (MQA) and grouped-query attention (GQA).\nBenchmarks revealed FlashAttention-2 to be up to 2x faster than FlashAttention and up to 9x faster than a standard attention implementation in PyTorch. Future developments include optimization for new hardware like H100 GPUs and new data types like FP8.\nMulti-Query Attention\nMulti-Query Attention changes the multiheaded attention mechanism.

MQA is GQA with one group, while standard multiheaded attention is GQA with the maximal number of groups.\n\nMultihead Latent Attention (MLA) is a low-rank approximation to standard MHA. Specifically, each hidden vector, before entering the attention mechanism, is first projected to two low-dimensional spaces (\"latent space\"), one for query and one for key-value (KV vector). This design minimizes the KV cache, as only the low-dimensional KV vector needs to be cached.\nSpeculative decoding\nSpeculative decoding is a method to accelerate token decoding. Similarly to speculative execution in CPUs, future tokens are computed quickly, then verified. If the quickly computed tokens are incorrect, they are discarded and computed slowly.\nThe key factor in speculative decoding is that a Transformer decoder can verify faster than it can decode, in the following sense.\nSuppose we have two transformer models like GPT-3 and GPT-3-small, both with a context window size of 512. To generate an entire context window autoregressively with greedy decoding with GPT-3, it must be run for 512 times, each time generating a token \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          x\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        ,\n        .\n        .\n        .\n        ,\n        \n          x\n          \n            512\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{512}}\n  \n, taking time \n  \n    \n      \n        512\n        \n          T\n          \n            GPT-3\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 512T_{\\text{GPT-3}}}\n  \n. However, if we had some educated guess for the values of these tokens, we could verify all of them in parallel, in one run of the model, by checking that each \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          x\n          \n            t\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x_{t}}\n  \n is indeed the token with the largest log-likelihood in the \n  \n    \n      \n        t\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle t}\n  \n-th output.\nIn speculative decoding, a smaller model or some other simple heuristic is used to generate a few speculative tokens that are subsequently verified by the larger model. For example, suppose we use GPT-3-small to generate four speculative tokens: \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                x\n                ~\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          \n            \n              \n                x\n                ~\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          \n            \n              \n                x\n                ~\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            3\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          \n            \n              \n                x\n                ~\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            4\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\tilde {x}}_{1},{\\tilde {x}}_{2},{\\tilde {x}}_{3},{\\tilde {x}}_{4}}\n  \n.

However, that vector can then be further processed by another Transformer block to predict the next token, and so on for arbitrarily many steps into the future. This trades off accuracy for speed, since each new token costs just one more Transformer block, rather than the entire stack.\nSub-quadratic transformers\nTraining transformer-based architectures can be expensive, especially for long inputs. Many methods have been developed to attempt to address the issue. In the image domain, Swin Transformer is an efficient architecture that performs attention inside shifting windows. In the audio domain, SepTr decouples the attention in time and frequency domains. Long Range Arena (2020) is a standard benchmark for comparing the behavior of transformer architectures over long inputs.\nAlternative attention graphs\nThe standard attention graph is either all-to-all or causal, both of which scales as \n  \n    \n      \n        O\n        (\n        \n          N\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle O(N^{2})}\n  \n where \n  \n    \n      \n        N\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle N}\n  \n is the number of tokens in a sequence.\nReformer (2020) reduces the computational load from \n  \n    \n      \n        O\n        (\n        \n          N\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle O(N^{2})}\n  \n to \n  \n    \n      \n        O\n        (\n        N\n        ln\n        \u2061\n        N\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle O(N\\ln N)}\n  \n by using locality-sensitive hashing and reversible layers. \nSparse attention uses attention graphs that grows slower than \n  \n    \n      \n        O\n        (\n        \n          N\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle O(N^{2})}\n  \n. For example, BigBird (2020) uses random small-world networks which grows as \n  \n    \n      \n        O\n        (\n        N\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle O(N)}\n  \n.\nOrdinary transformers require a memory size that is quadratic in the size of the context window. Attention-free transformers reduce this to a linear dependence while still retaining the advantages of a transformer by linking the key to the value.\nRandom Feature Attention\nRandom Feature Attention (2021) uses Fourier random features:\n  \n    \n      \n        \u03c6\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        =\n        \n          \n            1\n            \n              D\n            \n          \n        \n        [\n        cos\n        \u2061\n        \u27e8\n        \n          w\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        x\n        \u27e9\n        ,\n        sin\n        \u2061\n        \u27e8\n        \n          w\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        x\n        \u27e9\n        ,\n        \u22ef\n        cos\n        \u2061\n        \u27e8\n        \n          w\n          \n            D\n          \n        \n        ,\n        x\n        \u27e9\n        ,\n        sin\n        \u2061\n        \u27e8\n        \n          w\n          \n            D\n          \n        \n        ,\n        x\n        \u27e9\n        \n          ]\n          \n            T\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\varphi (x)={\\frac {1}{\\sqrt {D}}}[\\cos \\langle w_{1},x\\rangle ,\\sin \\langle w_{1},x\\rangle ,\\cdots \\cos \\langle w_{D},x\\rangle ,\\sin \\langle w_{D},x\\rangle ]^{T}}\n  \nwhere \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          w\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        .\n        .\n        .\n        ,\n        \n          w\n          \n            D\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle w_{1},...,w_{D}}\n  \n are independent samples from the normal distribution \n  \n    \n      \n        N\n        (\n        0\n        ,\n        \n          \u03c3\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        I\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle N(0,\\sigma ^{2}I)}\n  \n.

A 2022 study found that Transformers pretrained only on natural language can be finetuned on only 0.03% of parameters and become competitive with LSTMs on a variety of logical and visual tasks, demonstrating transfer learning. The LLaVA was a vision-language model composed of a language model (Vicuna-13B) and a vision model (ViT-L/14), connected by a linear layer. Only the linear layer is finetuned.\nVision transformers adapt the transformer to computer vision by breaking down input images as a series of patches, turning them into vectors, and treating them like tokens in a standard transformer.\nConformer and later Whisper follow the same pattern for speech recognition, first turning the speech signal into a spectrogram, which is then treated like an image, i.e. broken down into a series of patches, turned into vectors and treated like tokens in a standard transformer.\nPerceivers are a variant of Transformers designed for multimodality.\nFor image generation, notable architectures are DALL-E 1 (2021), Parti (2022), Phenaki (2023), and Muse (2023). Unlike later models, DALL-E is not a diffusion model. Instead, it uses a decoder-only Transformer that autoregressively generates a text, followed by the token representation of an image, which is then converted by a variational autoencoder to an image. Parti is an encoder-decoder Transformer, where the encoder processes a text prompt, and the decoder generates a token representation of an image. Muse is an encoder-only Transformer that is trained to predict masked image tokens from unmasked image tokens. During generation, all input tokens are masked, and the highest-confidence predictions are included for the next iteration, until all tokens are predicted. Phenaki is a text-to-video model. It is a bidirectional masked transformer conditioned on pre-computed text tokens. The generated tokens are then decoded to a video.\nApplications\nThe transformer has had great success in natural language processing (NLP). Many large language models such as GPT-2, GPT-3, GPT-4, Gemini, AlbertAGPT, Claude, BERT, Grok, XLNet, RoBERTa and ChatGPT demonstrate the ability of transformers to perform a wide variety of NLP-related subtasks and their related real-world applications, including:\n\nmachine translation\ntime series prediction\ndocument summarization\ndocument generation\nnamed entity recognition (NER)\nwriting computer code based on requirements expressed in natural language.\nspeech-to-text\nBeyond traditional NLP, the transformer architecture has had success in other applications, such as:\n\nbiological sequence analysis\nvideo understanding\nprotein folding (such as AlphaFold)\nevaluating chess board positions. Using static evaluation alone (that is, with no Minimax search) transformer achieved an Elo of 2895, putting it at grandmaster level.\nSee also\nseq2seq \u2013 Family of machine learning approaches\nPerceiver \u2013 Variant of Transformer designed for multimodal data\nVision transformer \u2013 Machine learning model for vision processing\nLarge language model \u2013 Type of machine learning model\nBERT (language model) \u2013 Series of language models developed by Google AI\nGenerative pre-trained transformer \u2013 Type of large language model\nT5 (language model) \u2013 Series of large language models developed by Google AI\nNotes\n\nReferences\n== Further reading ==", "result": "# Transformer (deep learning architecture)\n\nThe transformer is a deep learning model architecture first proposed in 2017 by Vaswani et al. in the paper, \"Attention Is All You Need\". The paper introduced the model as part of a new architecture for processing sequential data. The transformer model completely eliminated the use of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in this architecture.\n\nTransformer models are predominantly used in natural language processing (NLP), where they serve as foundational models for a variety of tasks such as language translation, text summarization, and question answering. They have also been applied to other areas, including computer vision, speech recognition, and time series forecasting.\n\n## History\n\nIn the early days of deep learning, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) dominated the field, achieving remarkable success in image recognition and processing tasks. However, CNNs faced limitations when dealing with sequential data, such as text or time-series data. This limitation led to the development of RNNs, which could handle sequential data effectively but were often computationally expensive and struggled with long-term dependencies.\n\nIn 2014, Google introduced the skip-thought vectors, which used RNNs to encode sentences into contextual representations. Although effective, these methods still relied heavily on RNNs and were not able to capture global dependencies efficiently.\n\nIn 2017, Vaswani et al. published the groundbreaking paper \"Attention Is All You Need,\" introducing the transformer architecture. This architecture revolutionized NLP by eliminating the need for RNNs entirely. Instead, it relied solely on attention mechanisms to process and understand sequences of data. The transformer model achieved state-of-the-art results across multiple NLP tasks and demonstrated the potential of self-attention mechanisms in capturing long-range dependencies more efficiently than traditional RNNs.\n\nSince then, numerous variations and improvements to the transformer architecture have been developed, such as BERT, GPT, XLNet, and T5. These models have further pushed the boundaries of what is possible with the transformer architecture, enabling breakthroughs in areas like machine translation, question answering, and text generation.\n\nOne notable example is BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) by Devlin et al. in 2018. Unlike previous models that processed text sequentially, BERT trained models to predict words in both forward and backward directions simultaneously. This bidirectional training allowed BERT to capture richer contextual information and significantly improved performance on various NLP tasks.\n\nAnother milestone was OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) series. GPT utilized large-scale transformer models to generate human-like text. Its ability to produce coherent and contextually relevant outputs showcased the potential of transformers for natural language generation.\n\nThese advancements sparked a surge of interest in transformer-based architectures across the research community and industry. Companies like Google, Microsoft, and Facebook developed their own versions of transformer models tailored to specific applications. For instance, Google introduced BERT Lite for mobile and edge computing, while Microsoft developed the MMT model for efficient cross-lingual translation.\n\nThe impact of the transformer architecture extends beyond NLP. Researchers began exploring its application in other domains such as computer vision, speech recognition, and time series analysis. Vision transformers (ViTs) adapted the transformer architecture for image classification, achieving impressive results in computer vision tasks. Similarly, transformer-based models showed promising performance in speech recognition and time series forecasting.\n\nIn recent years, transformer models have become increasingly complex and powerful. Models like GPT-3 and PaLM have reached unprecedented scales, with billions or even hundreds of billions of parameters. These models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in tasks ranging from language translation and text summarization to code generation and creative writing.\n\nAs transformer research continues to evolve, ongoing efforts focus on optimizing computational efficiency, reducing parameter sizes, and enhancing interpretability. Techniques such as model compression, attention mechanism pruning, and knowledge distillation aim to make transformer models more accessible and practical for real-world applications. Additionally, advances in multimodal transformers integrate information from multiple modalities (e.g., text, images, and audio), opening up new possibilities for multimodal AI systems.\n\nToday, the transformer architecture remains at the forefront of deep learning research and development. Its influence can be seen across various fields, driving innovation and shaping the future of artificial intelligence.\n\n## Architecture\n\nThe transformer architecture consists of two main components: the encoder and the decoder. Both components consist of multiple identical layers, each containing self-attention and feed-forward modules. The encoder processes the input sequence, while the decoder generates the output sequence.\n\n### Encoder\n\nThe encoder is responsible for encoding the input sequence into a sequence of hidden representation vectors. The input sequence is represented as a matrix X \u2208\u211d^L \u00d7 d, where L is the length of the sequence and d is the dimensionality of each input vector.\n\nEach layer of the encoder contains a multi-head self-attention module followed by a feed-forward module. The self-attention module computes weighted averages of the input vectors using query, key, and value matrices. This allows the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence simultaneously. The resulting output is then passed through a feed-forward module, typically a position-wise fully connected feed-forward network (FFN).\n\nMathematically, the multi-head self-attention module can be expressed as:\n\n    Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QK^T/\u221a(d_k))V\n\nwhere Q, K, and V are the query, key, and value matrices obtained from the input matrix X through linear transformations.\n\nThe output of the encoder, denoted as Z \u2208\u211d^L \u00d7 d, is computed as follows:\n\n    Z = LayerNorm(FFN(SelfAttention(X)))\n\nHere, SelfAttention represents the multi-head self-attention module, FFN denotes the feed-forward module, and LayerNorm refers to layer normalization, a technique used to stabilize the activation distribution during training.\n\n### Decoder\n\nThe decoder generates the output sequence based on the encoded representation from the encoder and its own previous outputs. The input to the decoder consists of two parts: the encoded representation from the encoder (Z) and the previous decoder outputs (Y).\n\nSimilar to the encoder, the decoder also consists of multiple layers, each containing a masked multi-head self-attention module, a multi-head attention module, and a feed-forward module. The masked self-attention module ensures that each token is only attending to previous tokens in the output sequence, preventing information leakage from future tokens during generation.\n\nThe multi-head attention module in the decoder combines both the self-attention over the decoder's own outputs and attention between the decoder's outputs and the encoder's inputs. This allows the decoder to attend to relevant parts of the input sequence while generating the output sequence.\n\nMathematically, the masked multi-head self-attention module can be expressed as:\n\n    MaskedSelfAttention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QK^T/\u221a(d_k))V\n\nwhere Q, K, and V are the query, key, and value matrices obtained from the decoder's previous outputs through linear transformations. The masking operation ensures that each token attends only to previous tokens.\n\nThe output of the decoder, denoted as Y \u2208\u211d^L \u00d7 d, is computed as follows:\n\n    Y = LayerNorm(MultiHeadSelfAttention(MaskedSelfAttention(Decoder Previous Outputs)) + \n       MultiHeadAttention(Decoder Previous Outputs, Encoder Outputs, Encoder Outputs))\n\nHere, MaskedSelfAttention represents the masked multi-head self-attention module, MultiHeadAttention denotes the multi-head attention module combining encoder-decoder attention, and LayerNorm refers to layer normalization.\n\nThe final output sequence is generated by applying a softmax function to the last layer of the decoder, producing probability distributions over the vocabulary for each token in the sequence.\n\n### Attention Mechanism\n\nThe attention mechanism is a crucial component of the transformer architecture that enables the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence when generating each token in the output sequence. There are three types of attention mechanisms used in the transformer architecture: scaled dot-product attention, multi-head attention, and masked multi-head attention.\n\n**1. Scaled Dot-Product Attention**\n\nThe scaled dot-product attention computes a weighted average of the input vectors based on their dot products. It takes three matrices as input: Q (query), K (key), and V (value). The attention scores are computed as the dot product of the query matrix with the transpose of the key matrix, scaled by the square root of the key dimension size. The resulting scores are then passed through a softmax function to obtain attention weights, which are used to weigh the value matrix.\n\nMathematically, the scaled dot-product attention can be expressed as:\n\n    Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QK^T/\u221a(d_k))V\n\nwhere Q, K, and V are the query, key, and value matrices, respectively. The term \u221a(d_k) is used for scaling purposes to prevent the softmax operation from producing extreme values due to large dot products.\n\n**2. Multi-Head Attention**\n\nMulti-head attention is an extension of the scaled dot-product attention that uses multiple attention heads in parallel. Each head has its own set of learnable parameters (Q, K, V matrices) and operates independently on different subsets of the input features. The outputs from all heads are concatenated and projected into the desired dimensionality using a linear transformation.\n\nThe multi-head attention mechanism allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions. This enables the model to capture diverse patterns and relationships within the data, leading to improved performance on complex tasks.\n\nMathematically, the multi-head attention can be expressed as:\n\n    MultiHead(Q, K, V) = Concat(head_1, head_2, \u2026, head_h)W^O\n\nwhere head_i = Attention(QW_i^Q, KW_i^K, VW_i^V) for i = 1, 2, \u2026, h, W^O is the final projection matrix, and h is the number of attention heads.\n\n**3. Masked Multi-Head Attention**\n\nMasked multi-head attention is specifically designed for the decoder's self-attention module to ensure that each token in the output sequence only attends to previous tokens. This prevents the model from peeking into future information during generation, maintaining the autoregressive nature of the decoding process.\n\nThe masked multi-head attention mechanism works similarly to the standard multi-head attention, except that it applies a mask to the attention scores before the softmax operation. The mask sets the attention scores corresponding to future positions to negative infinity, ensuring that these positions are excluded from the attention computation.\n\nMathematically, the masked multi-head attention can be expressed as:\n\n    MaskedMultiHead(Q, K, V) = Concat(head_1, head_2, \u2026, head_h)W^O\n\nwhere head_i = Attention(QW_i^Q, KW_i^K, VW_i^V) for i = 1, 2, \u2026, h, W^O is the final projection matrix, and h is the number of attention heads. The attention function here includes the masking operation.\n\n### Feed-Forward Module\n\nThe feed-forward module in the transformer architecture consists of two fully connected layers with a nonlinear activation function (such as ReLU) in between. The input to the feed-forward module is the output from either the self-attention or multi-head attention module.\n\nThe feed-forward module transforms the intermediate representation by applying a nonlinear mapping to capture complex patterns in the data. Mathematically, the feed-forward module can be expressed as:\n\n    FFN(x) = max(0, xW_1 + b_1)W_2 + b_2\n\nwhere W_1 and W_2 are the weight matrices of the two fully connected layers, b_1 and b_2 are the bias terms, and max(0, \u00b7) denotes the ReLU activation function.\n\n### Positional Encoding\n\nTo provide information about the relative or absolute position of tokens in the input sequence, positional encoding is added to the input embeddings. Positional encoding is a fixed sinusoidal function that is added element-wise to the input embeddings.\n\nThe positional encoding is defined as:\n\n    PE_(pos, 2i) = sin(pos/10000^2i/d)\n    \n        PE_(pos, 2i+1) = cos(pos/10000^2i/d)\n\nwhere pos is the position of the token in the sequence, i is the dimension index, and d is the embedding dimension.\n\nBy incorporating positional encoding, the transformer model can learn to process sequences of variable lengths without relying on recurrence or convolutions, which are sensitive to sequence length.\n\n### Loss Function\n\nDuring training, the transformer model is optimized using an appropriate loss function, commonly the cross-entropy loss. The cross-entropy loss measures the difference between the predicted probability distribution over the vocabulary and the true target distribution.\n\nThe cross-entropy loss for a single training example can be expressed as:\n\n    \u2112 = -\u2211_t=1^L log P(y_t | x_1, x_2, \u2026, x_L)\n\nwhere L is the length of the output sequence, y_t is the target token at position t, and P(y_t | x_1, x_2, \u2026, x_L) is the predicted probability of y_t given the input sequence x_1, x_2, \u2026, x_L.\n\nDuring training, the model minimizes the cross-entropy loss using optimization algorithms such as Adam or SGD with techniques like gradient clipping and learning rate scheduling to improve convergence and generalization.\n\n### Training Process\n\nTraining a transformer model involves passing input sequences through the encoder, generating output sequences through the decoder, and minimizing the loss function using backpropagation. The training process can be summarized as follows:\n\n* Input Sequences: Input sequences are fed into the encoder, where each token is embedded into a dense vector space using learned embeddings.\n* Encoder Processing: The encoder processes the embedded input sequences through multiple layers of self-attention and feed-forward modules, producing a sequence of hidden representation vectors.\n* Decoder Initialization: The decoder starts with a special beginning-of-sequence (BOS) token and initializes its hidden state using the encoder's final hidden representation.\n* Output Generation: The decoder generates output tokens one by one. At each step, the decoder's self-attention module attends to its previous outputs and the encoder's hidden representation, while the multi-head attention module captures the relationship between the decoder's outputs and the encoder's inputs. The feed-forward module then processes the intermediate representations to produce the next predicted token.\n* Teacher Forcing: During training, teacher forcing is often used, where the ground truth token at each step is fed into the decoder instead of using the predicted token from the previous step. This helps the model learn more effectively.\n* Loss Computation: The cross-entropy loss is computed between the predicted probabilities for each token and the corresponding ground truth labels.\n* Backpropagation: The gradients of the loss with respect to the model parameters are computed using backpropagation through the entire computation graph, spanning both the encoder and decoder.\n* Parameter Update: The model parameters are updated using an optimization algorithm, such as Adam or SGD, to minimize the loss.\n\nThis iterative process of forward propagation, loss computation, backpropagation, and parameter update is repeated for multiple epochs over the training dataset. Regularization techniques such as dropout, label smoothing, and early stopping are often employed to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.\n\n### Pretraining and Fine-Tuning\n\nPretraining and fine-tuning are two important phases in the transformer model training pipeline.\n\n* Pretraining: Pretraining involves training the transformer model on a large amount of unlabeled data, typically from a wide range of domains and sources. The goal of pretraining is to learn general-purpose representations of language or other modalities that can be transferred to downstream tasks. During pretraining, the model is exposed to vast amounts of text, images, or other data, allowing it to discover universal patterns and features. Commonly used pretraining datasets include books, web pages, and news articles for language modeling tasks. Pretraining helps the model develop a strong understanding of language structures, syntax, and semantics, enabling it to generalize well to unseen data.\n* Fine-Tuning: Fine-tuning involves adapting the pretrained model to a specific downstream task by training it further on task-specific labeled data. During fine-tuning, the model parameters are updated to align the pretrained representations with the requirements of the target task. Fine-tuning allows the model to leverage the knowledge acquired during pretraining while tailoring it to the nuances of the particular task. For example, if the task is sentiment analysis, the model is fine-tuned on a dataset containing labeled examples of positive and negative sentiments. Fine-tuning helps the model adapt to task-specific nuances and achieve better performance compared to training from scratch.\n\nBy combining pretraining and fine-tuning, the transformer model can benefit from both general knowledge acquired during pretraining and task-specific knowledge gained during fine-tuning. This approach has proven to be highly effective in achieving state-of-the-art results across a wide range of natural language processing tasks.\n\n### Evaluation Metrics\n\nEvaluation metrics play a crucial role in assessing the performance of transformer models on various tasks. Different evaluation metrics are used depending on the nature of the task, such as classification, regression, or sequence-to-sequence tasks.\n\nFor binary classification tasks, metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are commonly used. Accuracy measures the proportion of correctly classified instances, while precision reflects the proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions. Recall measures the proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positive instances, and the F1 score provides a balance between precision and recall by calculating their harmonic mean.\n\nFor multi-class classification tasks, metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score per class, as well as macro-averaged or micro-averaged versions of these metrics, are often employed. Macro-averaging calculates the metric independently for each class and then takes the average, while micro-averaging aggregates the contributions of all instances before computing the metric.\n\nRegression tasks are typically evaluated using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared (coefficient of determination). MSE measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values, while MAE measures the average absolute difference. R-squared quantifies the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.\n\nFor sequence-to-sequence tasks, such as machine translation or text summarization, metrics like BLEU (bilingual evaluation understudy) score, ROUGE (recall-oriented understudy for automatic evaluation of summaries) score, and METEOR (Metric for Evaluation of Translation with Explicit ORdering) are commonly used. BLEU score measures the similarity between candidate and reference sequences by computing the geometric mean of n-gram precisions and a brevity penalty. ROUGE score focuses on unigram recall and penalizes significant differences in length between the candidate and reference summaries. METEOR evaluates translations by considering exact matching of stemmed words, stemming, and synonym matches.\n\nThese evaluation metrics help quantify the effectiveness of transformer models in solving different types of problems and guide the improvement of model performance through experimentation and hyperparameter tuning.\n\n### Applications\n\nThe versatility of transformer models has led to their widespread adoption across various domains and applications.

This includes methods such as domain-specific pretraining, transfer learning, and few-shot learning. By enabling transformer models to adapt to new domains efficiently, researchers aim to extend their applicability to emerging applications, such as healthcare, finance, and scientific discovery.\n\n* Interpretable Attention Mechanisms: Understanding how attention mechanisms operate within transformer models remains a challenge. Research is focused on developing interpretable attention mechanisms that provide insights into why certain tokens are attended to during inference. Techniques such as attention scoring, attention ranking, and attention saliency maps aim to reveal the underlying reasoning behind the model's decisions. Enhanced interpretability of attention mechanisms is crucial for building trust in transformer-based systems and identifying potential biases or errors in the model's predictions.\n\n* Generalization to Out-of-Distribution Data: Transformer models often struggle to generalize effectively to out-of-distribution (OOD) data, particularly when encountering inputs that differ significantly from the training distribution. This limitation arises from the models' tendency to memorize patterns in the training data rather than learning robust representations. Techniques such as data augmentation, adversarial training, and OOD detection methods are being explored to enhance the generalization capabilities of transformer models.\n\n* Hardware Acceleration and Parallelization: As transformer models continue to grow in size and complexity, efficient hardware acceleration becomes essential. Research is focused on optimizing transformer architectures for specialized hardware, such as GPUs, TPUs, and neuromorphic chips. This includes exploring parallelization techniques, memory-efficient implementations, and hardware-aware model optimizations. By leveraging advanced hardware, researchers aim to accelerate inference and training times, enabling faster deployment and scalability of transformer-based systems.\n\n* Transfer Learning and Few-Shot Learning: Transfer learning and few-shot learning techniques aim to leverage pre-trained transformer models for new tasks with minimal labeled data. Research is focused on developing more effective transfer learning strategies, such as parameter-efficient fine-tuning, prompt tuning, and meta-learning. Additionally, few-shot learning methods aim to enable transformer models to perform well on tasks with only a few examples, reducing the reliance on large labeled datasets. These approaches hold promise for improving the efficiency and adaptability of transformer-based systems in real-world scenarios.\n\n* Cross-Domain Adaptation and Multitasking: Transformer models are being explored for their potential to handle cross-domain adaptation and multitasking. Research is focused on developing architectures and training strategies that allow transformer models to seamlessly adapt to different domains and tasks. Techniques such as domain-adversarial training, multi-task learning, and modular transformer architectures aim to enable transformer models to learn shared representations across diverse domains and tasks.
