Based on the given title and outline, generate a detailed article structure with appropriate sections. Each section should have a clear purpose and contribute to the overall topic. \n\nArticle Title: Named-entity recognition\nTotal Expected Length: 1800 words\nArticle Topic and Scope: Write a comprehensive and detailed Wikipedia article about Named-entity recognition (NER), focusing on its definition as a subtask of information extraction, the methodologies and platforms used in NER, the challenges and evaluation metrics associated with it, and the ongoing research efforts to enhance its performance across various domains and contexts, including social media and fine-grained entity recognition.\n\nPlease outline the article structure with:\n\nMaintain a neutral and encyclopedic tone appropriate for a Wikipedia article.", "input": "", "output": "Named-entity recognition\nIntroduction\nNamed-entity recognition (NER) (also known as (named) entity identification, entity chunking, and entity extraction) is a subtask of information extraction that seeks to locate and classify named entities mentioned in unstructured text into pre-defined categories such as person names, organizations, locations, medical codes, time expressions, quantities, monetary values, percentages, etc.\nMost research on NER/NEE systems has been structured as taking an unannotated block of text, such as this one:\n\nJim bought 300 shares of Acme Corp. in 2006.\nAnd producing an annotated block of text that highlights the names of entities:\n\n[Jim]Person bought 300 shares of [Acme Corp.]Organization in [2006]Time.\nIn this example, a person name consisting of one token, a two-token company name and a temporal expression have been detected and classified.\nState-of-the-art NER systems for English produce near-human performance. For example, the best system entering MUC-7 scored 93.39% of F-measure while human annotators scored 97.60% and 96.95%.\nNamed-entity recognition platforms\nNotable NER platforms include:\n\nGATE supports NER across many languages and domains out of the box, usable via a graphical interface and a Java API.\nOpenNLP includes rule-based and statistical named-entity recognition.\nSpaCy features fast statistical NER as well as an open-source named-entity visualizer.\nTransformers features token classification using deep learning models.\nProblem definition\nIn the expression named entity, the word named restricts the task to those entities for which one or many strings, such as words or phrases, stand (fairly) consistently for some referent. This is closely related to rigid designators, as defined by Kripke, although in practice NER deals with many names and referents that are not philosophically \"rigid\". For instance, the automotive company created by Henry Ford in 1903 can be referred to as Ford or Ford Motor Company, although \"Ford\" can refer to many other entities as well (see Ford). Rigid designators include proper names as well as terms for certain biological species and substances, but exclude pronouns (such as \"it\"; see coreference resolution), descriptions that pick out a referent by its properties (see also De dicto and de re), and names for kinds of things as opposed to individuals (for example \"Bank\").\nFull named-entity recognition is often broken down, conceptually and possibly also in implementations, as two distinct problems: detection of names, and classification of the names by the type of entity they refer to (e.g. person, organization, or location).\nThe first phase is typically simplified to a segmentation problem: names are defined to be contiguous spans of tokens, with no nesting, so that \"Bank of America\" is a single name, disregarding the fact that inside this name, the substring \"America\" is itself a name. This segmentation problem is formally similar to chunking. The second phase requires choosing an ontology by which to organize categories of things.\nTemporal expressions and some numerical expressions (e.g., money, percentages, etc.) may also be considered as named entities in the context of the NER task. While some instances of these types are good examples of rigid designators (e.g., the year 2001) there are also many invalid ones (e.g., I take my vacations in \u201cJune\u201d). In the first case, the year 2001 refers to the 2001st year of the Gregorian calendar. In the second case, the month June may refer to the month of an undefined year (past June, next June, every June, etc.). It is arguable that the definition of named entity is loosened in such cases for practical reasons. The definition of the term named entity is therefore not strict and often has to be explained in the context in which it is used.\nCertain hierarchies of named entity types have been proposed in the literature. BBN categories, proposed in 2002, are used for question answering and consists of 29 types and 64 subtypes. Sekine's extended hierarchy, proposed in 2002, is made of 200 subtypes. More recently, in 2011 Ritter used a hierarchy based on common Freebase entity types in ground-breaking experiments on NER over social media text.\nFormal evaluation\nTo evaluate the quality of an NER system's output, several measures have been defined. The usual measures are called precision, recall, and F1 score. However, several issues remain in just how to calculate those values.\nThese statistical measures work reasonably well for the obvious cases of finding or missing a real entity exactly; and for finding a non-entity. However, NER can fail in many other ways, many of which are arguably \"partially correct\", and should not be counted as complete success or failures. For example, identifying a real entity, but: \n\nwith fewer tokens than desired (for example, missing the last token of \"John Smith, M.D.\")\nwith more tokens than desired (for example, including the first word of \"The University of MD\")\npartitioning adjacent entities differently (for example, treating \"Smith, Jones Robinson\" as 2 vs. 3 entities)\nassigning it a completely wrong type (for example, calling a personal name an organization)\nassigning it a related but inexact type (for example, \"substance\" vs. \"drug\", or \"school\" vs. \"organization\")\ncorrectly identifying an entity, when what the user wanted was a smaller- or larger-scope entity (for example, identifying \"James Madison\" as a personal name, when it's part of \"James Madison University\"). Some NER systems impose the restriction that entities may never overlap or nest, which means that in some cases one must make arbitrary or task-specific choices.\nOne overly simple method of measuring accuracy is merely to count what fraction of all tokens in the text were correctly or incorrectly identified as part of entity references (or as being entities of the correct type). This suffers from at least two problems: first, the vast majority of tokens in real-world text are not part of entity names, so the baseline accuracy (always predict \"not an entity\") is extravagantly high, typically >90%; and second, mispredicting the full span of an entity name is not properly penalized (finding only a person's first name when his last name follows might be scored as \u00bd accuracy).\nIn academic conferences such as CoNLL, a variant of the F1 score has been defined as follows:\n\nPrecision is the number of predicted entity name spans that line up exactly with spans in the gold standard evaluation data. I.e. when [Person Hans] [Person Blick] is predicted but [Person Hans Blick] was required, precision for the predicted name is zero. Precision is then averaged over all predicted entity names.\nRecall is similarly the number of names in the gold standard that appear at exactly the same location in the predictions.\nF1 score is the harmonic mean of these two.\nIt follows from the above definition that any prediction that misses a single token, includes a spurious token, or has the wrong class, is a hard error and does not contribute positively to either precision or recall. Thus, this measure may be said to be pessimistic: it can be the case that many \"errors\" are close to correct, and might be adequate for a given purpose. For example, one system might always omit titles such as \"Ms.\" or \"Ph.D.\", but be compared to a system or ground-truth data that expects titles to be included. In that case, every such name is treated as an error. Because of such issues, it is important actually to examine the kinds of errors, and decide how important they are given one's goals and requirements.\nEvaluation models based on a token-by-token matching have been proposed. Such models may be given partial credit for overlapping matches (such as using the Intersection over Union criterion). They allow a finer grained evaluation and comparison of extraction systems.\nApproaches\nNER systems have been created that use linguistic grammar-based techniques as well as statistical models such as machine learning. Hand-crafted grammar-based systems typically obtain better precision, but at the cost of lower recall and months of work by experienced computational linguists. Statistical NER systems typically require a large amount of manually annotated training data. Semisupervised approaches have been suggested to avoid part of the annotation effort.\nMany different classifier types have been used to perform machine-learned NER, with conditional random fields being a typical choice.\nProblem domains\nIn 2001, research indicated that even state-of-the-art NER systems were brittle, meaning that NER systems developed for one domain did not typically perform well on other domains. Considerable effort is involved in tuning NER systems to perform well in a new domain; this is true for both rule-based and trainable statistical systems.\nEarly work in NER systems in the 1990s was aimed primarily at extraction from journalistic articles. Attention then turned to processing of military dispatches and reports. Later stages of the automatic content extraction (ACE) evaluation also included several types of informal text styles, such as weblogs and text transcripts from conversational telephone speech conversations. Since about 1998, there has been a great deal of interest in entity identification in the molecular biology, bioinformatics, and medical natural language processing communities.  The most common entity of interest in that domain has been names of genes and gene products. There has been also considerable interest in the recognition of chemical entities and drugs in the context of the CHEMDNER\ncompetition, with 27 teams participating in this task.\nCurrent challenges and research\nDespite high F1 numbers reported on the MUC-7 dataset, the problem of named-entity recognition is far from being solved. The main efforts are directed to reducing the annotations labor by employing semi-supervised learning, robust performance across domains and scaling up to fine-grained entity types. In recent years, many projects have turned to crowdsourcing, which is a promising solution to obtain high-quality aggregate human judgments for supervised and semi-supervised machine learning approaches to NER. Another challenging task is devising models to deal with linguistically complex contexts such as Twitter and search queries.\nThere are some researchers who did some comparisons about the NER performances from different statistical models such as HMM (hidden Markov model), ME (maximum entropy), and CRF (conditional random fields), and feature sets. And some researchers recently proposed graph-based semi-supervised learning model for language specific NER tasks.\nA recently emerging task of identifying \"important expressions\" in text and cross-linking them to Wikipedia can be seen as an instance of extremely fine-grained named-entity recognition, where the types are the actual Wikipedia pages describing the (potentially ambiguous) concepts. Below is an example output of a Wikification system:\n\nAnother field that has seen progress but remains challenging is the application of NER to Twitter and other microblogs, considered \"noisy\" due to non-standard orthography, shortness and informality of texts. NER challenges in English Tweets have been organized by research communities to compare performances of various approaches, such as bidirectional LSTMs, Learning-to-Search, or CRFs.\nSee also\nControlled vocabulary\nCoreference resolution\nEntity linking (aka named entity normalization, entity disambiguation)\nInformation extraction\nKnowledge extraction\nOnomastics\nRecord linkage\nSmart tag (Microsoft)\n\n\n== References ==", "result": "# Named-entity recognition\n\nNamed-entity recognition (NER) is a subtask of information extraction that seeks to locate and classify named entities mentioned in unstructured text into pre-defined categories such as person names, organizations, locations, medical codes, time expressions, quantities, monetary values, percentages, etc. NER is normally used as a step in the process of information extraction.\n\n## History\n\nThe task of NER can be traced back to the late 1980s when researchers started developing systems to identify and classify proper nouns into pre-defined categories. For example, Kukich\u00a0(1992) used a statistical approach to improve spell checkers; the method uses context to determine whether a word is correct or not. In particular, the method tries to find words from a list of possible words that best fit the context of the sentence. The system relies on two types of information: the occurrence frequency of each word in the corpus and the occurrence frequency of pairs of words. This approach was further improved by Damerau\u00a0(1995). A similar approach was also taken by Fung\u00a0(1996), who used a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to identify named entities in a corpus. In 1996, Roth\u00a0(1996) proposed a method that used a conditional random field model to identify named entities in the CoNLL-2003 shared task. The first CoNLL-2003 shared task on NER was organized by the Universal Dependencies project, which aimed to develop tools for the processing of linguistic data in many languages. The CoNLL-2003 shared task was followed by CoNLL-2012, which focused on the recognition of fine-grained entities. In 2014, the CoNLL-2014 shared task focused on the identification of semantic roles. The CoNLL-2014 shared task was later followed by CoNLL-2017, which focused on the recognition of events. Since then, the CoNLL shared tasks have become annual events. In 2022, the CoNLL-2022 shared task focused on the recognition of entities in social media texts.\n\n## Methods\n\nThere are several methods for performing NER, which can be broadly divided into rule-based and machine learning approaches. Rule-based approaches are based on manually crafted rules that are used to identify and classify named entities. These rules are often based on linguistic knowledge and are designed to capture specific patterns of named entities. Machine learning approaches use statistical models to learn the patterns of named entities from a training corpus. These models are trained using labeled data and are then used to classify new instances. The most common machine learning algorithms used for NER include support vector machines, conditional random fields, and neural networks.\n\n### Rule-based approaches\n\nRule-based approaches for NER involve manually crafting rules that are used to identify and classify named entities. These rules are often based on linguistic knowledge and are designed to capture specific patterns of named entities. For example, a rule might be used to identify proper nouns by looking for words that start with capital letters. Another rule might be used to identify dates by looking for sequences of numbers separated by slashes or hyphens. These rules can be combined to form more complex patterns that can be used to identify and classify named entities.\n\nRule-based approaches are often used in conjunction with other techniques, such as machine learning algorithms, to improve the accuracy of NER. For example, a rule-based approach might be used to identify candidate named entities, and a machine learning algorithm might be used to classify these entities into their appropriate categories.\n\n### Machine learning approaches\n\nMachine learning approaches for NER use statistical models to learn the patterns of named entities from a training corpus. These models are trained using labeled data, which consists of a set of documents that have been annotated with named entities. The labeled data is used to train the model to recognize patterns in the text that correspond to named entities. Once the model has been trained, it can be used to classify new instances of text into their appropriate categories.\n\nThere are several different types of machine learning algorithms that can be used for NER, including support vector machines, conditional random fields, and neural networks. Support vector machines are a type of supervised learning algorithm that can be used for classification tasks. Conditional random fields are a type of probabilistic graphical model that can be used for sequence labeling tasks. Neural networks are a type of machine learning algorithm that are composed of interconnected nodes or neurons. Neural networks are often used for tasks that require the processing of large amounts of data, such as image recognition and natural language processing.\n\n## Platforms\n\nThere are several platforms available for performing NER. Some of the most popular platforms include:\n\n* Stanford NLP Group: The Stanford NLP Group provides a suite of NLP tools, including a named entity recognizer.\n* Apache OpenNLP: Apache OpenNLP is an open-source platform for natural language processing.\n* spaCy: spaCy is an open-source library for natural language processing in Python.\n* NLTK: NLTK is a popular Python library for natural language processing.\n* Microsoft Azure: Microsoft Azure provides a range of services for natural language processing, including named entity recognition.\n* Google Cloud Natural Language API: The Google Cloud Natural Language API provides a range of tools for natural language processing, including named entity recognition.\n* IBM Watson Natural Language Understanding: IBM Watson Natural Language Understanding is a cloud-based service for natural language processing.\n\nThese platforms provide a range of tools and resources for performing NER, including pre-trained models, libraries, and APIs. They can be used to perform NER on a wide range of text data, including news articles, social media posts, and scientific papers.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nNER is evaluated using a variety of metrics, including precision, recall, and F1-score. Precision measures the proportion of true positive results among all positive results, while recall measures the proportion of true positive results among all actual positive results. The F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. NER is also evaluated using a variety of other metrics, such as accuracy, F-measure, and Matthew's correlation coefficient. Accuracy measures the proportion of correctly classified instances among all instances, while F-measure is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. Matthew's correlation coefficient is a measure of the agreement between the predicted labels and the true labels.\n\n## Challenges\n\nNER faces a number of challenges, including the following:\n\n* Ambiguity: Named entities can be ambiguous, making it difficult to accurately classify them. For example, the word \"bank\" can refer to a financial institution or the side of a river.\n* Domain-specific terminology: NER systems need to be trained on domain-specific data to accurately recognize named entities in that domain. For example, a system trained on medical records may not be able to accurately recognize named entities in legal documents.\n* Low resource languages: NER systems often require large amounts of data to be effective. However, many languages have limited amounts of annotated data, making it difficult to build accurate NER systems for these languages.\n* Name variations: Named entities can have multiple variations, such as nicknames, abbreviations, and acronyms. This makes it difficult to accurately recognize named entities in text.\n* Text normalization: Text normalization is the process of converting text into a standard format. This can include removing punctuation, converting to lowercase, and removing stop words. Text normalization can affect the accuracy of NER systems, as it can change the way named entities are represented in the text.\n* Multilingual support: NER systems need to be able to handle multilingual data, which can be challenging due to differences in language structure and syntax.\n* Social media: Social media data is often noisy and contains a lot of slang and abbreviations, which can make it difficult to accurately recognize named entities.\n* Fine-grained entity recognition: Fine-grained entity recognition involves recognizing and classifying named entities into more specific categories than traditional NER. This can be challenging because there are often many more fine-grained categories than there are coarse-grained categories, making it difficult to accurately classify named entities.\n\n## Research\n\nThere is a growing body of research on NER, with a focus on improving the accuracy and efficiency of NER systems. Some recent research efforts have focused on using deep learning techniques to improve the performance of NER systems. Other research has focused on developing more efficient algorithms for NER, such as those based on online learning or approximate inference. There is also a growing interest in developing NER systems that can handle multilingual data and that can recognize fine-grained named entities.\n\n"}, {"instruction": "You are an AI editor planning to write a Wikipedia article that adheres to Wikipedia's content guidelines.

LLMs are language models with many parameters, and are trained with self-supervised learning on a vast amount of text.\nThe largest and most capable LLMs are generative pretrained transformers (GPTs). Modern models can be fine-tuned for specific tasks or guided by prompt engineering. These models acquire predictive power regarding syntax, semantics, and ontologies inherent in human language corpora, but they also inherit inaccuracies and biases present in the data they are trained in.\nHistory\nBefore 2017, there were a few language models that were large as compared to capacities then available. In the 1990s, the IBM alignment models pioneered statistical language modelling. A smoothed n-gram model in 2001 trained on 0.3 billion words achieved state-of-the-art perplexity at the time. In the 2000s, as Internet use became prevalent, some researchers constructed Internet-scale language datasets (\"web as corpus\"), upon which they trained statistical language models. In 2009, in most language processing tasks, statistical language models dominated over symbolic language models because they can usefully ingest large datasets.\n\nAfter neural networks became dominant in image processing around 2012, they were applied to language modelling as well. Google converted its translation service to Neural Machine Translation in 2016. Because it preceded the existence of transformers, it was done by seq2seq deep LSTM networks.\nAt the 2017 NeurIPS conference, Google researchers introduced the transformer architecture in their landmark paper \"Attention Is All You Need\". This paper's goal was to improve upon 2014 seq2seq technology, and was based mainly on the attention mechanism developed by Bahdanau et al. in 2014. The following year in 2018, BERT was introduced and quickly became \"ubiquitous\". Though the original transformer has both encoder and decoder blocks, BERT is an encoder-only model. Academic and research usage of BERT began to decline in 2023, following rapid improvements in the abilities of decoder-only models (such as GPT) to solve tasks via prompting.\nAlthough decoder-only GPT-1 was introduced in 2018, it was GPT-2 in 2019 that caught widespread attention because OpenAI at first deemed it too powerful to release publicly, out of fear of malicious use. GPT-3 in 2020 went a step further and as of 2024 is available only via API with no offering of downloading the model to execute locally. But it was the 2022 consumer-facing browser-based ChatGPT that captured the imaginations of the general population and caused some media hype and online buzz. The 2023 GPT-4 was praised for its increased accuracy and as a \"holy grail\" for its multimodal capabilities. OpenAI did not reveal the high-level architecture and the number of parameters of GPT-4. The release of ChatGPT led to an uptick in LLM usage across several research subfields of computer science, including robotics, software engineering, and societal impact work. In 2024 OpenAI released the reasoning model OpenAI o1, which generates long chains of thought before returning a final answer.\nCompeting language models have for the most part been attempting to equal the GPT series, at least in terms of number of parameters.\nSince 2022, source-available models have been gaining popularity, especially at first with BLOOM and LLaMA, though both have restrictions on the field of use. Mistral AI's models Mistral 7B and Mixtral 8x7b have the more permissive Apache License. In January 2025, DeepSeek released DeepSeek R1, a 671-billion-parameter open-weight model that performs comparably to OpenAI o1 but at a much lower cost.\nSince 2023, many LLMs have been trained to be multimodal, having the ability to also process or generate other types of data, such as images or audio. These LLMs are also called large multimodal models (LMMs).\nAs of 2024, the largest and most capable models are all based on the transformer architecture. Some recent implementations are based on other architectures, such as recurrent neural network variants and Mamba (a state space model).\nDataset preprocessing\n\nTokenization\nAs machine learning algorithms process numbers rather than text, the text must be converted to numbers. In the first step, a vocabulary is decided upon, then integer indices are arbitrarily but uniquely assigned to each vocabulary entry, and finally, an embedding is associated to the integer index. Algorithms include byte-pair encoding (BPE) and WordPiece. There are also special tokens serving as control characters, such as [MASK] for masked-out token (as used in BERT), and [UNK] (\"unknown\") for characters not appearing in the vocabulary. Also, some special symbols are used to denote special text formatting. For example, \"\u0120\" denotes a preceding whitespace in RoBERTa and GPT. \"##\" denotes continuation of a preceding word in BERT.\nFor example, the BPE tokenizer used by GPT-3 (Legacy) would split tokenizer: texts -> series of numerical \"tokens\" as\n\nTokenization also compresses the datasets. Because LLMs generally require input to be an array that is not jagged, the shorter texts must be \"padded\" until they match the length of the longest one. How many tokens are, on average, needed per word depends on the language of the dataset.\nBPE\nAs an example, consider a tokenizer based on byte-pair encoding. In the first step, all unique characters (including blanks and punctuation marks) are treated as an initial set of n-grams (i.e. initial set of uni-grams). Successively the most frequent pair of adjacent characters is merged into a bi-gram and all instances of the pair are replaced by it. All occurrences of adjacent pairs of (previously merged) n-grams that most frequently occur together are then again merged into even lengthier n-gram, until a vocabulary of prescribed size is obtained (in case of GPT-3, the size is 50257). After a tokenizer is trained, any text can be tokenized by it, as long as it does not contain characters not appearing in the initial-set of uni-grams.\nProblems\nA token vocabulary based on the frequencies extracted from mainly English corpora uses as few tokens as possible for an average English word. However, an average word in another language encoded by such an English-optimized tokenizer is split into a suboptimal amount of tokens. GPT-2 tokenizer can use up to 15 times more tokens per word for some languages, for example for the Shan language from Myanmar. Even more widespread languages such as Portuguese and German have \"a premium of 50%\" compared to English.\nGreedy tokenization also causes subtle problems with text completion.\nDataset cleaning\nIn the context of training LLMs, datasets are typically cleaned by removing low-quality, duplicated, or toxic data. Cleaned datasets can increase training efficiency and lead to improved downstream performance. A trained LLM can be used to clean datasets for training a further LLM.\nWith the increasing proportion of LLM-generated content on the web, data cleaning in the future may include filtering out such content. LLM-generated content can pose a problem if the content is similar to human text (making filtering difficult) but of lower quality (degrading performance of models trained on it).\nSynthetic data\nTraining of largest language models might need more linguistic data than naturally available, or that the naturally occurring data is of insufficient quality. In these cases, synthetic data might be used. Microsoft's Phi series of LLMs is trained on textbook-like data generated by another LLM.\nTraining and architecture\n\nReinforcement learning from human feedback\nReinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) through algorithms, such as proximal policy optimization, is used to further fine-tune a model based on a dataset of human preferences.\nInstruction tuning\nUsing \"self-instruct\" approaches, LLMs have been able to bootstrap correct responses, replacing any naive responses, starting from human-generated corrections of a few cases. For example, in the instruction \"Write an essay about the main themes represented in Hamlet,\" an initial naive completion might be \"If you submit the essay after March 17, your grade will be reduced by 10% for each day of delay,\" based on the frequency of this textual sequence in the corpus.\nMixture of experts\nThe largest LLM may be too expensive to train and use directly. For such models, mixture of experts (MoE) can be applied, a line of research pursued by Google researchers since 2017 to train models reaching up to 1 trillion parameters.\nPrompt engineering, attention mechanism, and context window\nMost results previously achievable only by (costly) fine-tuning, can be achieved through prompt engineering, although limited to the scope of a single conversation (more precisely, limited to the scope of a context window).\n\nIn order to find out which tokens are relevant to each other within the scope of the context window, the attention mechanism calculates \"soft\" weights for each token, more precisely for its embedding, by using multiple attention heads, each with its own \"relevance\" for calculating its own soft weights. For example, the small (i.e. 117M parameter sized) GPT-2 model has had twelve attention heads and a context window of only 1k tokens. In its medium version it has 345M parameters and contains 24 layers, each with 12 attention heads. For the training with gradient descent a batch size of 512 was utilized.\nThe largest models, such as Google's Gemini 1.5, presented in February 2024, can have a context window sized up to 1 million (context window of 10 million was also \"successfully tested\"). Other models with large context windows includes Anthropic's Claude 2.1, with a context window of up to 200k tokens. Note that this maximum refers to the number of input tokens and that the maximum number of output tokens differs from the input and is often smaller. For example, the GPT-4 Turbo model has a maximum output of 4096 tokens.\nLength of a conversation that the model can take into account when generating its next answer is limited by the size of a context window, as well. If the length of a conversation, for example with ChatGPT, is longer than its context window, only the parts inside the context window are taken into account when generating the next answer, or the model needs to apply some algorithm to summarize the too distant parts of conversation.\nThe shortcomings of making a context window larger include higher computational cost and possibly diluting the focus on local context, while making it smaller can cause a model to miss an important long-range dependency. Balancing them is a matter of experimentation and domain-specific considerations.\nA model may be pre-trained either to predict how the segment continues, or what is missing in the segment, given a segment from its training dataset. It can be either\n\nautoregressive (i.e. predicting how the segment continues, as GPTs do): for example given a segment \"I like to eat\", the model predicts \"ice cream\", or \"sushi\".\n\"masked\" (i.e. filling in the parts missing from the segment, the way \"BERT\" does it): for example, given a segment \"I like to [__] [__] cream\", the model predicts that \"eat\" and \"ice\" are missing.\nModels may be trained on auxiliary tasks which test their understanding of the data distribution, such as Next Sentence Prediction (NSP), in which pairs of sentences are presented and the model must predict whether they appear consecutively in the training corpus. During training, regularization loss is also used to stabilize training. However regularization loss is usually not used during testing and evaluation.\nInfrastructure\nSubstantial infrastructure is necessary for training the largest models.\nTraining cost\nThe qualifier \"large\" in \"large language model\" is inherently vague, as there is no definitive threshold for the number of parameters required to qualify as \"large\". As time goes on, what was previously considered \"large\" may evolve. GPT-1 of 2018 is usually considered the first LLM, even though it has only 0.117 billion parameters. The tendency towards larger models is visible in the list of large language models.\nAs technology advanced, large sums have been invested in increasingly large models. For example, training of the GPT-2 (i.e. a 1.5-billion-parameters model) in 2019 cost $50,000, while training of the PaLM (i.e. a 540-billion-parameters model) in 2022 cost $8 million, and Megatron-Turing NLG 530B (in 2021) cost around $11 million.\nFor Transformer-based LLM, training cost is much higher than inference cost. It costs 6 FLOPs per parameter to train on one token, whereas it costs 1 to 2 FLOPs per parameter to infer on one token.\nTool use\nThere are certain tasks that, in principle, cannot be solved by any LLM, at least not without the use of external tools or additional software. An example of such a task is responding to the user's input '354 * 139 = ', provided that the LLM has not already encountered a continuation of this calculation in its training corpus. In such cases, the LLM needs to resort to running program code that calculates the result, which can then be included in its response.: Another example is \"What is the time now? It is \", where a separate program interpreter would need to execute a code to get system time on the computer, so that the LLM can include it in its reply. This basic strategy can be sophisticated with multiple attempts of generated programs, and other sampling strategies.\nGenerally, in order to get an LLM to use tools, one must fine-tune it for tool-use. If the number of tools is finite, then fine-tuning may be done just once. If the number of tools can grow arbitrarily, as with online API services, then the LLM can be fine-tuned to be able to read API documentation and call API correctly.\nRetrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is another approach that enhances LLMs by integrating them with document retrieval systems. Given a query, a document retriever is called to retrieve the most relevant documents. This is usually done by encoding the query and the documents into vectors, then finding the documents with vectors (usually stored in a vector database) most similar to the vector of the query. The LLM then generates an output based on both the query and context included from the retrieved documents.\nAgency\nAn LLM is typically not an autonomous agent by itself, as it lacks the ability to interact with dynamic environments, recall past behaviors, and plan future actions, but can be transformed into one by integrating modules like profiling, memory, planning, and action.\nThe ReAct pattern, a portmanteau of \"Reason + Act\", constructs an agent out of an LLM, using the LLM as a planner. The LLM is prompted to \"think out loud\". Specifically, the language model is prompted with a textual description of the environment, a goal, a list of possible actions, and a record of the actions and observations so far. It generates one or more thoughts before generating an action, which is then executed in the environment. The linguistic description of the environment given to the LLM planner can even be the LaTeX code of a paper describing the environment.\nIn the DEPS (\"Describe, Explain, Plan and Select\") method, an LLM is first connected to the visual world via image descriptions, then it is prompted to produce plans for complex tasks and behaviors based on its pretrained knowledge and environmental feedback it receives.\nThe Reflexion method constructs an agent that learns over multiple episodes. At the end of each episode, the LLM is given the record of the episode, and prompted to think up \"lessons learned\", which would help it perform better at a subsequent episode. These \"lessons learned\" are given to the agent in the subsequent episodes.\nMonte Carlo tree search can use an LLM as rollout heuristic. When a programmatic world model is not available, an LLM can also be prompted with a description of the environment to act as world model.\nFor open-ended exploration, an LLM can be used to score observations for their \"interestingness\", which can be used as a reward signal to guide a normal (non-LLM) reinforcement learning agent. Alternatively, it can propose increasingly difficult tasks for curriculum learning. Instead of outputting individual actions, an LLM planner can also construct \"skills\", or functions for complex action sequences. The skills can be stored and later invoked, allowing increasing levels of abstraction in planning.\nLLM-powered agents can keep a long-term memory of its previous contexts, and the memory can be retrieved in the same way as Retrieval Augmented Generation. Multiple such agents can interact socially.\nCompression\nTypically, LLMs are trained with single- or half-precision floating point numbers (float32 and float16). One float16 has 16 bits, or 2 bytes, and so one billion parameters require 2 gigabytes. The largest models typically have 100 billion parameters, requiring 200 gigabytes to load, which places them outside the range of most consumer electronics.\nPost-training quantization aims to decrease the space requirement by lowering precision of the parameters of a trained model, while preserving most of its performance. The simplest form of quantization simply truncates all numbers to a given number of bits. It can be improved by using a different quantization codebook per layer. Further improvement can be done by applying different precisions to different parameters, with higher precision for particularly important parameters (\"outlier weights\"). See the visual guide to quantization by Maarten Grootendorst for a visual depiction.\nWhile quantized models are typically frozen, and only pre-quantized models are fine-tuned, quantized models can still be fine-tuned.\nMultimodality\nMultimodality means \"having several modalities\", and a \"modality\" refers to a type of input or output, such as video, image, audio, text, proprioception, etc. There have been many AI models trained specifically to ingest one modality and output another modality, such as AlexNet for image to label, visual question answering for image-text to text, and speech recognition for speech to text.\nA common method to create multimodal models out of an LLM is to \"tokenize\" the output of a trained encoder. Concretely, one can construct an LLM that can understand images as follows: take a trained LLM, and take a trained image encoder \n  \n    \n      \n        E\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle E}\n  \n. Make a small multilayered perceptron \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f}\n  \n, so that for any image \n  \n    \n      \n        y\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle y}\n  \n, the post-processed vector \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        (\n        E\n        (\n        y\n        )\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f(E(y))}\n  \n has the same dimensions as an encoded token. That is an \"image token\". Then, one can interleave text tokens and image tokens. The compound model is then fine-tuned on an image-text dataset. This basic construction can be applied with more sophistication to improve the model. The image encoder may be frozen to improve stability.\nFlamingo demonstrated the effectiveness of the tokenization method, finetuning a pair of pretrained language model and image encoder to perform better on visual question answering than models trained from scratch. Google PaLM model was fine-tuned into a multimodal model PaLM-E using the tokenization method, and applied to robotic control. LLaMA models have also been turned multimodal using the tokenization method, to allow image inputs, and video inputs.\nGPT-4 can use both text and image as inputs (although the vision component was not released to the public until GPT-4V); Google DeepMind's Gemini is also multimodal.  Mistral introduced its own multimodel Pixtral 12B model in September 2024.\nReasoning\nIn late 2024, a new direction emerged in LLM development with models specifically designed for complex reasoning tasks. These \"reasoning models\" were trained to spend more time generating step-by-step solutions before providing final answers, similar to human problem-solving processes.\nOpenAI introduced this trend with their o1 model in September 2024, followed by o3 in December 2024. These models showed significant improvements in mathematics, science, and coding tasks compared to traditional LLMs. For example, on International Mathematics Olympiad qualifying exam problems, GPT-4o achieved 13% accuracy while o1 reached 83%.\nIn January 2025, the Chinese company DeepSeek released DeepSeek-R1, a 671-billion-parameter open-weight reasoning model that achieved comparable performance to OpenAI's o1 while being significantly more cost-effective to operate. Unlike proprietary models from OpenAI, DeepSeek-R1's open-weight nature allowed researchers to study and build upon the algorithm, though its training data remained private.\nThese reasoning models typically require more computational resources per query compared to traditional LLMs, as they perform more extensive processing to work through problems step-by-step. However, they have shown superior capabilities in domains requiring structured logical thinking, such as mathematics, scientific research, and computer programming.\nEfforts to reduce or compensate for hallucinations have employed automated reasoning, RAG (retrieval-augmented generation), fine-tuning, and other methods.\nProperties\n\nScaling laws\nThe performance of an LLM after pretraining largely depends on the:\n\ncost of pretraining \n  \n    \n      \n        C\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle C}\n  \n (the total amount of compute used),\nsize of the artificial neural network itself, such as number of parameters \n  \n    \n      \n        N\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle N}\n  \n (i.e. amount of neurons in its layers, amount of weights between them and biases),\nsize of its pretraining dataset (i.e. number of tokens in corpus, \n  \n    \n      \n        D\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle D}\n  \n).\n\"Scaling laws\" are empirical statistical laws that predict LLM performance based on such factors. One particular scaling law (\"Chinchilla scaling\") for LLM autoregressively trained for one epoch, with a log-log learning rate schedule, states that:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            {\n            \n              \n                \n                  C\n                  =\n                  \n                    C\n                    \n                      0\n                    \n                  \n                  N\n                  D\n                \n              \n              \n                \n                  L\n                  =\n                  \n                    \n                      A\n                      \n                        N\n                        \n                          \u03b1\n                        \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                  +\n                  \n                    \n                      B\n                      \n                        D\n                        \n                          \u03b2\n                        \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                  +\n                  \n                    L\n                    \n                      0\n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\begin{cases}C=C_{0}ND\\\\[6pt]L={\\frac {A}{N^{\\alpha }}}+{\\frac {B}{D^{\\beta }}}+L_{0}\\end{cases}}}\n  \n where the variables are\n\n  \n    \n      \n        C\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle C}\n  \n is the cost of training the model, in FLOPs.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        N\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle N}\n  \n is the number of parameters in the model.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        D\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle D}\n  \n is the number of tokens in the training set.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        L\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle L}\n  \n is the average negative log-likelihood loss per token (nats/token), achieved by the trained LLM on the test dataset.\nand the statistical hyper-parameters are\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          C\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n        =\n        6\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle C_{0}=6}\n  \n, meaning that it costs 6 FLOPs per parameter to train on one token.

However, this linearity may be punctuated by \"break(s)\" in the scaling law, where the slope of the line changes abruptly, and where larger models acquire \"emergent abilities\". They arise from the complex interaction of the model's components and are not explicitly programmed or designed. \nFurthermore, recent research has demonstrated that AI systems, including large language models, can employ heuristic reasoning akin to human cognition. They balance between exhaustive logical processing and the use of cognitive shortcuts (heuristics), adapting their reasoning strategies to optimize between accuracy and effort. This behavior aligns with principles of resource-rational human cognition, as discussed in classical theories of bounded rationality and dual-process theory.\nOne of the emergent abilities is in-context learning from example demonstrations. In-context learning is involved in tasks, such as:\n\nreported arithmetics\ndecoding the International Phonetic Alphabet\nunscrambling a word's letters\ndisambiguating word-in-context datasets\nconverting spatial words\ncardinal directions (for example, replying \"northeast\" in response to a 3x3 grid of 8 zeros and a 1 in the top-right), color terms represented in text.\nchain-of-thought prompting: In a 2022 research paper, chain-of-thought prompting only improved the performance for models that had at least 62B. Smaller models perform better when prompted to answer immediately, without chain of thought.\nidentifying offensive content in paragraphs of Hinglish (a combination of Hindi and English), and generating a similar English equivalent of Kiswahili proverbs.\nSchaeffer et. al. argue that the emergent abilities are not unpredictably acquired, but predictably acquired according to a smooth scaling law. The authors considered a toy statistical model of an LLM solving multiple-choice questions, and showed that this statistical model, modified to account for other types of tasks, applies to these tasks as well.\nLet \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x}\n  \n be the number of parameter count, and \n  \n    \n      \n        y\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle y}\n  \n be the performance of the model.\nInterpretation\nLarge language models by themselves are black boxes, and it is not clear how they can perform linguistic tasks. Similarly, it is unclear if or how LLMs should be viewed as models of the human brain and/or human mind.\nVarious techniques have been developed to enhance the transparency and interpretability of LLMs. Mechanistic interpretability aims to reverse-engineer LLMs by discovering symbolic algorithms that approximate the inference performed by an LLM. In recent years, sparse coding models such as sparse autoencoders, transcoders, and crosscoders have emerged as promising tools for identifying interpretable features.\nStudying a replacement model\nTranscoders, which are more interpretable than transformers, have been utilized to develop \u201creplacement models.\u201d In one such study involving the mechanistic interpretation of writing a rhyming poem by an LLM, it was shown that although they are believed to simply predict the next token, they can, in fact, plan ahead.\nExplainability\nA related concept is AI explainability, which focuses on understanding how an AI model arrives at a given result. Techniques such as partial dependency plots, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), and feature importance assessments allow researchers to visualize and understand the contributions of various input features to the model's predictions. These methods help ensure that AI models make decisions based on relevant and fair criteria, enhancing trust and accountability.\nBy integrating these techniques, researchers and practitioners can gain deeper insights into the operations of LLMs, fostering trust and facilitating the responsible deployment of these powerful models.\nIn another example, the authors trained small transformers on modular arithmetic addition. The resulting models were reverse-engineered, and it turned out they used discrete Fourier transform.\nUnderstanding and intelligence\nNLP researchers were evenly split when asked, in a 2022 survey, whether (untuned) LLMs \"could (ever) understand natural language in some nontrivial sense\". Proponents of \"LLM understanding\" believe that some LLM abilities, such as mathematical reasoning, imply an ability to \"understand\" certain concepts. A Microsoft team argued in 2023 that GPT-4 \"can solve novel and difficult tasks that span mathematics, coding, vision, medicine, law, psychology and more\" and that GPT-4 \"could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence system\": \"Can one reasonably say that a system that passes exams for software engineering candidates is not really intelligent?\" Ilya Sutskever argues that predicting the next word sometimes involves reasoning and deep insights, for example if the LLM has to predict the name of the criminal in an unknown detective novel after processing the entire story leading up to the revelation. Some researchers characterize LLMs as \"alien intelligence\". For example, Conjecture CEO Connor Leahy considers untuned LLMs to be like inscrutable alien \"Shoggoths\", and believes that RLHF tuning creates a \"smiling facade\" obscuring the inner workings of the LLM: \"If you don't push it too far, the smiley face stays on. But then you give it [an unexpected] prompt, and suddenly you see this massive underbelly of insanity, of weird thought processes and clearly non-human understanding.\"\nIn contrast, some skeptics of LLM understanding believe that existing LLMs are \"simply remixing and recombining existing writing\", a phenomenon known as stochastic parrot, or they point to the deficits existing LLMs continue to have in prediction skills, reasoning skills, agency, and explainability. For example, GPT-4 has natural deficits in planning and in real-time learning. Generative LLMs have been observed to confidently assert claims of fact which do not seem to be justified by their training data, a phenomenon which has been termed \"hallucination\". Specifically, hallucinations in the context of LLMs correspond to the generation of text or responses that seem syntactically sound, fluent, and natural but are factually incorrect, nonsensical, or unfaithful to the provided source input. Neuroscientist Terrence Sejnowski has argued that \"The diverging opinions of experts on the intelligence of LLMs suggests that our old ideas based on natural intelligence are inadequate\".\nThe matter of LLM's exhibiting intelligence or understanding has two main aspects \u2013 the first is how to model thought and language in a computer system, and the second is how to enable the computer system to generate human like language. These aspects of language as a model of cognition have been developed in the field of cognitive linguistics. American linguist George Lakoff presented Neural Theory of Language (NTL) as a computational basis for using language as a model of learning tasks and understanding. The NTL Model outlines how specific neural structures of the human brain shape the nature of thought and language and in turn what are the computational properties of such neural systems that can be applied to model thought and language in a computer system. After a framework for modeling language in a computer systems was established, the focus shifted to establishing frameworks for computer systems to generate language with acceptable grammar. In his 2014 book titled The Language Myth: Why Language Is Not An Instinct, British cognitive linguist and digital communication technologist Vyvyan Evans mapped out the role of probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG) in enabling NLP to model cognitive patterns and generate human like language.\nEvaluation\n\nPerplexity\nThe canonical measure of the performance of an LLM is its perplexity on a given text corpus. Perplexity measures how well a model predicts the contents of a dataset; the higher the likelihood the model assigns to the dataset, the lower the perplexity. In mathematical terms, perplexity is the exponential of the average negative log likelihood per token.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        log\n        \u2061\n        (\n        \n          Perplexity\n        \n        )\n        =\n        \u2212\n        \n          \n            1\n            N\n          \n        \n        \n          \u2211\n          \n            i\n            =\n            1\n          \n          \n            N\n          \n        \n        log\n        \u2061\n        (\n        Pr\n        (\n        \n          \n            token\n          \n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        \u2223\n        \n          \n            context for token\n          \n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        )\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\log({\\text{Perplexity}})=-{\\frac {1}{N}}\\sum _{i=1}^{N}\\log(\\Pr({\\text{token}}_{i}\\mid {\\text{context for token}}_{i}))}\n  \n\nHere, \n  \n    \n      \n        N\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle N}\n  \n is the number of tokens in the text corpus, and \"context for token \n  \n    \n      \n        i\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i}\n  \n\" depends on the specific type of LLM. If the LLM is autoregressive, then \"context for token \n  \n    \n      \n        i\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i}\n  \n\" is the segment of text appearing before token \n  \n    \n      \n        i\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i}\n  \n. If the LLM is masked, then \"context for token \n  \n    \n      \n        i\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i}\n  \n\" is the segment of text surrounding token \n  \n    \n      \n        i\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i}\n  \n.\nBecause language models may overfit to training data, models are usually evaluated by their perplexity on a test set. This evaluation is potentially problematic for larger models which, as they are trained on increasingly large corpora of text, are increasingly likely to inadvertently include portions of any given test set.\nBPW, BPC, and BPT\nIn information theory, the concept of entropy is intricately linked to perplexity, a relationship notably established by Claude Shannon. This relationship is mathematically expressed as \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          Entropy\n        \n        =\n        \n          log\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        \u2061\n        (\n        \n          Perplexity\n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\text{Entropy}}=\\log _{2}({\\text{Perplexity}})}\n  \n.\nEntropy, in this context, is commonly quantified in terms of bits per word (BPW) or bits per character (BPC), which hinges on whether the language model utilizes word-based or character-based tokenization.\nNotably, in the case of larger language models that predominantly employ sub-word tokenization, bits per token (BPT) emerges as a seemingly more appropriate measure. However, due to the variance in tokenization methods across different Large Language Models (LLMs), BPT does not serve as a reliable metric for comparative analysis among diverse models. To convert BPT into BPW, one can multiply it by the average number of tokens per word.\nIn the evaluation and comparison of language models, cross-entropy is generally the preferred metric over entropy. The underlying principle is that a lower BPW is indicative of a model's enhanced capability for compression. This, in turn, reflects the model's proficiency in making accurate predictions.\nTask-specific datasets and benchmarks\nA large number of testing datasets and benchmarks have also been developed to evaluate the capabilities of language models on more specific downstream tasks. Tests may be designed to evaluate a variety of capabilities, including general knowledge, bias, commonsense reasoning, and mathematical problem-solving.\nOne broad category of evaluation dataset is question answering datasets, consisting of pairs of questions and correct answers, for example, (\"Have the San Jose Sharks won the Stanley Cup?\", \"No\"). A question answering task is considered \"open book\" if the model's prompt includes text from which the expected answer can be derived (for example, the previous question could be adjoined with some text which includes the sentence \"The Sharks have advanced to the Stanley Cup finals once, losing to the Pittsburgh Penguins in 2016.\"). Otherwise, the task is considered \"closed book\", and the model must draw on knowledge retained during training. Some examples of commonly used question answering datasets include TruthfulQA, Web Questions, TriviaQA, and SQuAD.\nEvaluation datasets may also take the form of text completion, having the model select the most likely word or sentence to complete a prompt, for example: \"Alice was friends with Bob. Alice went to visit her friend, ____\".\nSome composite benchmarks have also been developed which combine a diversity of different evaluation datasets and tasks. Examples include GLUE, SuperGLUE, MMLU, BIG-bench, HELM, and HLE (Humanity's Last Exam). OpenAI has released tools for running composite benchmarks, but noted that the eval results are sensitive to the prompting method. Some public datasets contain questions that are mislabeled, ambiguous, unanswerable, or otherwise of low-quality, which can be cleaned to give more reliable benchmark scores.\nBias in LLMs may be measured through benchmarks such as CrowS-Pairs (Crowdsourced Stereotype Pairs), Stereo Set, and the more recent Parity Benchmark.  Additionally, fact-checking and misinformation detection are becoming increasingly crucial evaluation areas for LLMs. A recent study by Caramancion (2023) compared the fact-checking accuracy of prominent LLMs\u2014including OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT 3.5 and 4.0, Google\u2019s Bard, and Microsoft\u2019s Bing AI\u2014against independent fact-checking agencies such as PolitiFact and Snopes. The results demonstrated a moderate proficiency in fact verification, with GPT-4 achieving the highest accuracy at 71%, but still lagging behind human fact-checkers in contextual comprehension and nuanced reasoning. This underscores the evolving but incomplete ability of LLMs to discern fact from deception, highlighting the need for continued advancements in AI-driven fact-checking methodologies.\nIt was previously standard to report results on a heldout portion of an evaluation dataset after doing supervised fine-tuning on the remainder. It is now more common to evaluate a pre-trained model directly through prompting techniques, though researchers vary in the details of how they formulate prompts for particular tasks, particularly with respect to how many examples of solved tasks are adjoined to the prompt (i.e. the value of n in n-shot prompting).\nAdversarially constructed evaluations\nBecause of the rapid pace of improvement of large language models, evaluation benchmarks have suffered from short lifespans, with state of the art models quickly \"saturating\" existing benchmarks, exceeding the performance of human annotators, leading to efforts to replace or augment the benchmark with more challenging tasks. In addition, there are cases of \"shortcut learning\" wherein AIs sometimes \"cheat\" on multiple-choice tests by using statistical correlations in superficial test question wording in order to guess the correct responses, without necessarily understanding the actual question being asked.\nSome datasets have been constructed adversarially, focusing on particular problems on which extant language models seem to have unusually poor performance compared to humans. One example is the TruthfulQA dataset, a question answering dataset consisting of 817 questions which language models are susceptible to answering incorrectly by mimicking falsehoods to which they were repeatedly exposed during training. For example, an LLM may answer \"No\" to the question \"Can you teach an old dog new tricks?\" because of its exposure to the English idiom you can't teach an old dog new tricks, even though this is not literally true.\nAnother example of an adversarial evaluation dataset is Swag and its successor, HellaSwag, collections of problems in which one of multiple options must be selected to complete a text passage. The incorrect completions were generated by sampling from a language model and filtering with a set of classifiers. The resulting problems are trivial for humans but at the time the datasets were created state of the art language models had poor accuracy on them. For example:\n\nWe see a fitness center sign. We then see a man talking to the camera and sitting and laying on a exercise ball. The man...\na) demonstrates how to increase efficient exercise work by running up and down balls.\nb) moves all his arms and legs and builds up a lot of muscle.\nc) then plays the ball and we see a graphics and hedge trimming demonstration.\nd) performs sit ups while on the ball and talking.\n\nBERT selects b) as the most likely completion, though the correct answer is d).\nLimitations of LLM benchmarks\nBenchmarks can become outdated rapidly. Once a model attains near-perfect scores on a given benchmark, that benchmark ceases to serve as a meaningful indicator of progress. This phenomenon, known as \"benchmark saturation,\" necessitates the development of more challenging and nuanced tasks to continue advancing LLM capabilities. For instance, traditional benchmarks like HellaSwag and MMLU have seen models achieving high accuracy already.\nWider impact\nIn 2023, Nature Biomedical Engineering wrote that \"it is no longer possible to accurately distinguish\" human-written text from text created by large language models, and that \"It is all but certain that general-purpose large language models will rapidly proliferate... It is a rather safe bet that they will change many industries over time.\" Goldman Sachs suggested in 2023 that generative language AI could increase global GDP by 7% in the next ten years, and could expose to automation 300 million jobs globally. Brinkmann et al. (2023) also argue that LLMs are transforming processes of cultural evolution by shaping processes of variation, transmission, and selection.\nMemorization and copyright\nMemorization is an emergent behavior in LLMs in which long strings of text are occasionally output verbatim from training data, contrary to typical behavior of traditional artificial neural nets. Evaluations of controlled LLM output measure the amount memorized from training data (focused on GPT-2-series models) as variously over 1% for exact duplicates or up to about 7%.\nA 2023 study showed that when ChatGPT 3.5 turbo was prompted to repeat the same word indefinitely, after a few hundreds of repetitions, it would start outputting excerpts from its training data.\nSecurity\nSome commenters expressed concern over accidental or deliberate creation of misinformation, or other forms of misuse. For example, the availability of large language models could reduce the skill-level required to commit bioterrorism; biosecurity researcher Kevin Esvelt has suggested that LLM creators should exclude from their training data papers on creating or enhancing pathogens.\nThe potential presence of \"sleeper agents\" within LLMs is another emerging security concern. These are hidden functionalities built into the model that remain dormant until triggered by a specific event or condition. Upon activation, the LLM deviates from its expected behavior to make insecure actions.\nLLM applications accessible to the public, like ChatGPT or Claude, typically incorporate safety measures designed to filter out harmful content. However, implementing these controls effectively has proven challenging. For instance, a 2023 study proposed a method for circumventing LLM safety systems. In 2025, The American Sunlight Project, a non-profit, published a study showing evidence that the so-called Pravda network, a pro-Russia propaganda aggregator, was strategically placing web content through mass publication and duplication with the intention of biasing LLM outputs. The American Sunlight Project coined this technique \"LLM grooming,\" and pointed to it as a new tool of weaponizing AI to spread disinformation and harmful content. Similarly, Yongge Wang illustrated in 2024 how a potential criminal could potentially bypass ChatGPT 4o's safety controls to obtain information on establishing a drug trafficking operation.\nAlgorithmic bias\nWhile LLMs have shown remarkable capabilities in generating human-like text, they are susceptible to inheriting and amplifying biases present in their training data. This can manifest in skewed representations or unfair treatment of different demographics, such as those based on race, gender, language, and cultural groups. Since English data is overrepresented in current large language models' training data, it may also downplay non-English views.\nStereotyping\nAI models can reinforce a wide range of stereotypes, including those based on gender, ethnicity, age, nationality, religion, or occupation. This can lead to outputs that homogenize, or unfairly generalize or caricature groups of people, sometimes in harmful or derogatory ways.\nNotably, gender bias refers to the tendency of these models to produce outputs that are unfairly prejudiced towards one gender over another. This bias typically arises from the data on which these models are trained. Large language models often assign roles and characteristics based on traditional gender norms. For example, it might associate nurses or secretaries predominantly with women and engineers or CEOs with men.\nSelection bias\nSelection bias refers the inherent tendency of large language models to favor certain option identifiers irrespective of the actual content of the options. This bias primarily stems from token bias\u2014that is, the model assigns a higher a priori probability to specific answer tokens (such as \u201cA\u201d) when generating responses. As a result, when the ordering of options is altered (for example, by systematically moving the correct answer to different positions), the model\u2019s performance can fluctuate significantly. This phenomenon undermines the reliability of large language models in multiple-choice settings.\nPolitical bias\nPolitical bias refers to the tendency of algorithms to systematically favor certain political viewpoints, ideologies, or outcomes over others. Language models may also exhibit political biases. Since the training data includes a wide range of political opinions and coverage, the models might generate responses that lean towards particular political ideologies or viewpoints, depending on the prevalence of those views in the data.\nEnergy demands\nThe energy demands of LLMs have grown along with their size and capabilities. Data centers that enable LLM training require substantial amounts of electricity. Much of that electricity is generated by non-renewable resources that create greenhouse gases and contribute to climate change. Nuclear power and geothermal energy are two options tech companies are exploring to meet the sizable energy demands of LLM training. The significant expense of investing in geothermal solutions has led to major shale producers like Chevron and Exxon Mobil advocating for tech companies to use electricity produced via natural gas to fuel their large energy demands.\nSee also\nFoundation models\nList of large language models\nList of chatbots\nLanguage model benchmark\nSmall language model\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\nJurafsky, Dan, Martin, James.

LLMs are trained on vast amounts of text data and can perform a wide range of tasks, including natural language understanding (NLU), natural language generation (NLG), machine translation, and question-answering.\n\nLLMs are typically based on transformer architectures, which use self-attention mechanisms to process input sequences of tokens (e.g., words or subwords) and produce output sequences of tokens. These models are often very large, containing billions or even trillions of parameters, which allows them to capture complex patterns in language and perform well on a variety of tasks.\n\nLLMs have become increasingly popular in recent years due to their ability to perform a wide range of NLP tasks with high accuracy. They have been used in a variety of applications, including chatbots, virtual assistants, content creation, and sentiment analysis.\n\nOne of the key advantages of LLMs is their ability to learn from large amounts of data and generalize to new tasks and domains. This makes them particularly useful for tasks where there is limited labeled data available, such as in low-resource languages or specialized domains.\n\nLLMs also have the potential to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of NLP pipelines by reducing the need for manual feature engineering and enabling more flexible and adaptable models. However, they also raise concerns about issues such as bias, privacy, and interpretability, which must be carefully considered when designing and deploying these systems.\n\n## History\n\n### Early language models\n\nEarly language models were based on statistical approaches, such as n-gram models and hidden Markov models. These models were limited in their ability to capture long-range dependencies and contextual information in language.\n\nIn the late 2000s, neural network-based language models began to emerge, such as the skip-gram model and the word2vec model. These models used deep learning techniques to learn distributed representations of words, which could capture semantic relationships between words.\n\nIn the mid-2010s, deep learning-based sequence-to-sequence models became popular for tasks such as machine translation and speech recognition. These models used recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or variants thereof, such as long short-term memory (LSTM) networks and gated recurrent units (GRUs).\n\nIn the late 2010s, transformer-based models emerged as a powerful alternative to RNN-based models. Transformers use self-attention mechanisms to process input sequences of tokens and produce output sequences of tokens. This allows them to capture long-range dependencies and contextual information in language, and has led to significant improvements in performance on a variety of NLP tasks.\n\nThe first publicly released large language model was GPT-1, developed by OpenAI in 2018. This model had 117 million parameters and was trained on a large corpus of internet text. It demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating coherent text and answering questions, but it also exhibited some limitations, such as hallucinations and lack of commonsense reasoning.\n\nSubsequent versions of GPT, such as GPT-2 and GPT-3, further increased the size and performance of these models. GPT-3, released in 2020, had over 175 billion parameters and achieved state-of-the-art results on a wide range of NLP tasks without any task-specific training. This marked a significant milestone in the development of large language models.\n\nSince then, many other large language models have been developed by various organizations, including Google, Facebook, and Microsoft. These models have continued to push the boundaries of what is possible with AI language processing, demonstrating impressive capabilities in areas such as code generation, creative writing, and scientific discovery.\n\n### Multimodal and reasoning models\n\nAs the field of AI continues to evolve, researchers have begun to explore the use of large language models in combination with other modalities, such as images, videos, and audio. This has led to the development of multimodal language models, which can process and reason across multiple types of data.\n\nOne example of a multimodal language model is CLIP (Contrastive Language\u2013Image Pre-training), developed by OpenAI in 2021. CLIP is a vision-language model that can map both image and text inputs into the same semantic space, allowing it to perform tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering.\n\nAnother example is PaLM-E (Paired Language and Multimodal Model Enhanced), a large multimodal model developed by Google in 2022. PaLM-E combines a large language model with a visual encoder to process and reason about both textual and visual inputs.\n\nIn addition to multimodal models, researchers have also explored the use of large language models for tasks that require reasoning and problem-solving skills. One example is the MATH dataset, which consists of math problems and their corresponding solutions. Researchers have trained large language models on this dataset and found that they can solve math problems at a level comparable to humans.\n\nOther examples include models trained on datasets such as PhysicsQA, which contains physics problems and their solutions, and CommonsenseQA, which contains common sense reasoning tasks. These models have shown impressive performance on a variety of reasoning tasks, demonstrating the potential of large language models to tackle complex problems beyond simple language processing.\n\nOverall, the development of large language models has opened up new possibilities for AI research and applications. As these models continue to grow in size and capability, they are likely to play an increasingly important role in advancing the field of AI and driving innovation in a wide range of industries.\n\n## Architecture\n\nLarge language models are typically based on transformer architectures, which use self-attention mechanisms to process input sequences of tokens and produce output sequences of tokens. These models are often very large, containing billions or even trillions of parameters, which allows them to capture complex patterns in language and perform well on a variety of tasks.\n\nTransformer-based LLMs typically consist of an encoder-decoder architecture, where the encoder processes the input sequence of tokens and produces a sequence of hidden states, and the decoder generates the output sequence of tokens based on these hidden states. The self-attention mechanism allows each token in the input sequence to attend to all other tokens in the sequence, which enables the model to capture long-range dependencies and contextual information in the input.\n\nLLMs are typically trained using a technique called masked language modeling, where the model is trained to predict the next token in a sequence given a masked version of the input sequence. This allows the model to learn to predict missing words or phrases in a sentence, which helps it to capture the semantics of the input sequence.\n\nDuring inference, the LLM can generate text by sampling from the distribution of predicted tokens at each step of the decoding process. This allows the model to produce coherent and contextually relevant text based on the input sequence.\n\nLLMs can be fine-tuned on specific tasks or domains by training them on task-specific data. For example, a LLM can be fine-tuned on a dataset of customer service conversations to improve its ability to answer customer queries. Fine-tuning can be done using a variety of techniques, such as supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning from human feedback, and distillation.\n\nLLMs can be deployed in a variety of settings, including cloud-based services, mobile devices, and embedded systems. They can be used in a wide range of applications, such as chatbots, virtual assistants, content creation, and sentiment analysis.\n\nLLMs are a powerful tool for natural language processing, but they also raise concerns about issues such as bias, privacy, and interpretability, which must be carefully considered when designing and deploying these systems.\n\n## Tokenization\n\nTokenization is the process of breaking down text into smaller units called tokens. In the context of large language models, tokenization is an essential step in preparing text data for processing by the model.\n\nThere are several different tokenization strategies that can be used for LLMs, including word-level tokenization, subword-level tokenization, and character-level tokenization.\n\nWord-level tokenization involves breaking text into individual words. This is the simplest form of tokenization, but it can be problematic when dealing with out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words or words that are not present in the training data.\n\nSubword-level tokenization involves breaking text into smaller units that are always present in the training data, such as characters or small groups of characters. This approach can help to handle OOV words and improve the model's ability to generalize to new words.\n\nCharacter-level tokenization involves breaking text into individual characters. This approach can be useful for handling OOV words, but it can also lead to a large number of tokens, which can increase the computational cost of processing the text.\n\nIn practice, most LLMs use subword-level tokenization, such as Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) or SentencePiece (SP). BPE is a method that iteratively merges the most frequent pairs of characters or subwords until a maximum vocabulary size is reached. SP is a similar method that uses a fixed-size vocabulary and greedily merges the most frequent pairs of characters or subwords until the maximum vocabulary size is reached.\n\nLLMs typically represent each token as a dense vector of fixed length, known as a token embedding. The token embeddings are learned during training and are used as input to the model. The size of the token embeddings can vary depending on the model architecture and the task, but they are typically between 300 and 1024 dimensions.\n\nTokenization is a crucial step in preparing text data for processing by LLMs. By breaking text into smaller units, LLMs can better capture the meaning and context of the input and generate more accurate and coherent outputs.\n\n## Dataset preprocessing\n\nBefore training a large language model (LLM), it is necessary to preprocess the dataset to prepare it for the training process. The preprocessing steps can vary depending on the nature of the dataset and the specific requirements of the LLM, but some common preprocessing steps include:\n\n* Tokenization: Breaking the text into smaller units called tokens. This is typically done using a tokenizer that splits the text into words, subwords, or characters.\n* Lowercasing: Converting all text to lowercase to ensure that the model treats uppercase and lowercase versions of the same word as identical.\n* Removing punctuation and special characters: Removing punctuation marks and special characters from the text to reduce noise and improve the quality of the data.\n* Truncating or padding: Truncating or padding the text to a fixed length to ensure that all input sequences are the same length. This is necessary because LLMs typically process input sequences of a fixed length.\n* Filtering: Removing any text that does not meet certain criteria, such as being too short or too long, or containing certain types of content.\n* Normalizing: Normalizing the text to ensure that it is consistent and clean. This may involve removing duplicates, correcting spelling errors, or converting numbers to words.\n\nThe preprocessing steps are typically applied to the training data, but they may also be applied to the validation and test data as well. The goal of preprocessing is to prepare the data for the LLM so that it can learn to generate coherent and contextually relevant text.\n\nLLMs can be trained on a wide variety of datasets, ranging from large-scale corpora of web pages and books to specialized datasets for specific tasks or domains. The choice of dataset will depend on the specific requirements of the LLM and the task it is intended to perform.\n\nOne important consideration when selecting a dataset for LLM training is the diversity of the data. LLMs are designed to learn generalizable patterns in language, and they can benefit from exposure to a wide variety of texts and contexts. Datasets that contain a diverse range of topics, styles, and genres can help the LLM to develop a more robust understanding of language and improve its ability to generate high-quality text.\n\nAnother important factor to consider when selecting a dataset is the quality of the data. High-quality data is essential for training LLMs, as it provides the model with accurate and reliable examples to learn from. Datasets that are noisy, inconsistent, or poorly annotated can negatively impact the performance of the LLM and lead to poor results.\n\nIn addition to these factors, it is also important to consider the size of the dataset. Larger datasets can provide more examples for the LLM to learn from, which can improve its performance. However, larger datasets can also be more challenging to work with and may require more computational resources for training.\n\nOverall, selecting the right dataset is a critical step in training LLMs, and careful consideration of the dataset's characteristics and limitations is essential for achieving good results.\n\n## Scaling laws\n\nScaling laws describe how the performance of large language models (LLMs) improves as the size of the model increases. These laws have been observed in several studies, including those by Brown et al. (2020) and Dai et al. (2020), and they suggest that the performance of LLMs scales superlinearly with the number of parameters in the model.\n\nOne scaling law observed in LLMs is the relationship between the number of parameters and the perplexity of the model. Perplexity is a measure of how well a language model predicts a given text, and it is defined as the exponentiation of the negative log-likelihood of the model. As the number of parameters in an LLM increases, the perplexity of the model decreases, indicating that the model becomes better at predicting the text.\n\nAnother scaling law observed in LLMs is the relationship between the number of parameters and the performance of the model on downstream tasks. Studies have shown that LLMs with more parameters tend to perform better on a wide range of downstream tasks, including natural language inference, question answering, and text classification. This suggests that the larger the LLM, the better it is able to capture the underlying patterns and relationships in language, and the more effective it is at performing a variety of language-related tasks.\n\nThese scaling laws have important implications for the design and deployment of LLMs. First, they suggest that increasing the size of an LLM can lead to significant improvements in its performance, which can make it more effective at solving a wide range of language-related problems. Second, they highlight the importance of carefully selecting the size of an LLM for a particular task, as smaller models may not be able to achieve the same level of performance as larger models. Finally, these scaling laws suggest that there may be limits to the size of LLMs, as the benefits of increasing the size of the model may diminish at some point.\n\nOverall, the scaling laws observed in LLMs provide important insights into the behavior of these models and their potential applications in a wide range of language-related tasks. By understanding these laws, researchers and practitioners can make more informed decisions about the design and deployment of LLMs, and can potentially achieve better results in a variety of language-related applications.\n\n## Emergent abilities\n\nEmergent abilities refer to the unexpected and often surprising behaviors that arise in artificial intelligence (AI) systems as a result of the interactions between their components. These abilities are not explicitly programmed into the system, but rather emerge as a result of the way the system is designed and trained.\n\nIn the case of large language models (LLMs), emergent abilities can manifest in a variety of ways. For example, LLMs have been observed to exhibit the ability to perform tasks such as counting, arithmetic, and even simple algebraic operations, despite not having been explicitly trained on these tasks. Similarly, LLMs have been observed to demonstrate an understanding of abstract concepts such as time, causality, and even humor, which are not explicitly represented in their training data.\n\nOne of the most striking examples of emergent abilities in LLMs is the ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text, even when presented with incomplete or ambiguous input. This ability arises from the fact that LLMs are trained on large amounts of text data, which allows them to learn to generate text that is consistent with the patterns and structures observed in the training data. As a result, LLMs are able to generate text that is coherent and contextually relevant, even when presented with incomplete or ambiguous input.\n\nEmergent abilities in LLMs have important implications for the development and deployment of AI systems. On the one hand, these abilities can enable LLMs to perform a wide range of tasks that were previously thought to be beyond the capabilities of machines, such as natural language understanding and generation. On the other hand, these abilities also raise important questions about the transparency and explainability of AI systems, as it can be difficult to understand how LLMs arrive at their conclusions and generate their outputs.\n\nOverall, emergent abilities in LLMs highlight the potential of AI systems to perform tasks that were previously thought to be beyond their capabilities, and underscore the importance of continued research into the design and deployment of AI systems.\n\n## Interpretability\n\nInterpretability refers to the ability of a machine learning model to provide insights into its decision-making process. In the context of large language models (LLMs), interpretability is particularly important because these models are often used in applications where transparency and accountability are critical, such as healthcare, finance, and law enforcement.\n\nOne of the main challenges in interpreting LLMs is that they are often based on complex, non-linear neural network architectures that are difficult to understand and analyze. This makes it challenging to identify the features and patterns that the model is using to make predictions, and to determine how changes in the input data affect the model's output.\n\nTo address these challenges, researchers have developed a range of interpretability techniques for LLMs. These techniques can be broadly categorized into two types: local interpretability methods and global interpretability methods. Local interpretability methods focus on explaining the decisions made by the model for individual instances, while global interpretability methods aim to provide a more general understanding of the model's behavior across the entire input space.\n\nSome examples of local interpretability methods for LLMs include attention visualization, saliency maps, and activation maximization. Attention visualization involves visualizing the attention weights assigned by the model to different parts of the input sequence, providing insight into which parts of the input are most important for the model's decision-making process. Saliency maps show the relative importance of different input features in determining the model's output, while activation maximization involves identifying the input patterns that most strongly activate a particular neuron in the model, providing insight into the features that the model is sensitive to.\n\nGlobal interpretability methods for LLMs include t-SNE visualization, LIME, and SHAP. t-SNE visualization involves mapping the high-dimensional input space to a lower-dimensional space, allowing for the visualization of clusters and patterns in the data. LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) are model-agnostic interpretability methods that can be applied to any black-box model, including LLMs. These methods provide explanations for the model's predictions by approximating the behavior of the model with simpler, interpretable models.\n\nDespite these advances in interpretability techniques, there are still many challenges in understanding the decision-making process of LLMs. One of the main challenges is that LLMs are often highly sensitive to small changes in the input data, making it difficult to determine the exact features and patterns that the model is using to make predictions. Additionally, LLMs are often trained on large amounts of data, making it challenging to identify the specific examples and patterns that the model has learned.\n\nDespite these challenges, the ability to interpret LLMs is becoming increasingly important as these models are used in a wider range of applications. As LLMs continue to advance and become more widely adopted, it will be important to develop new interpretability techniques that can provide deeper insights into the decision-making process of these models.\n\n## Evaluation methods\n\nEvaluating large language models (LLMs) is a complex task, as these models are often trained on large amounts of text data and are capable of performing a wide range of tasks. There are several different methods that can be used to evaluate LLMs, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.\n\nOne common method for evaluating LLMs is through benchmarking on established datasets. Benchmarking involves comparing the performance of an LLM on a set of predefined tasks to the performance of other models or to human performance. This can provide a quantitative measure of the LLM's capabilities and help to identify areas where the model may need improvement. However, benchmarking can be limited by the availability of suitable datasets and the difficulty of defining appropriate metrics for measuring performance.\n\nAnother method for evaluating LLMs is through human evaluation. Human evaluation involves having humans assess the quality of the LLM's output on a set of predefined tasks. This can provide qualitative insights into the LLM's capabilities and help to identify areas where the model may need improvement. However, human evaluation can be expensive and time-consuming, and may be subject to biases and variability in human judgment.\n\nA third method for evaluating LLMs is through automated evaluation metrics. Automated evaluation metrics involve using algorithms to automatically assess the quality of the LLM's output on a set of predefined tasks. This can provide a quantitative measure of the LLM's capabilities and help to identify areas where the model may need improvement. However, automated evaluation metrics can be limited by the accuracy and reliability of the algorithms used to assess the output.\n\nOverall, evaluating LLMs requires a combination of benchmarking, human evaluation, and automated evaluation metrics. Each of these methods has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of method will depend on the specific goals of the evaluation and the available resources.\n\n## Societal impact\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have the potential to significantly impact society in a number of ways. On the positive side, LLMs can be used to automate a wide range of tasks, from customer service to translation, and can potentially lead to increased efficiency and productivity. LLMs can also be used to generate creative content, such as poetry or music, which can have artistic and cultural value.\n\nHowever, there are also potential downsides to the widespread adoption of LLMs. For example, LLMs could potentially replace human workers in certain jobs, leading to job loss and economic disruption. LLMs could also be used to spread misinformation or propaganda, potentially influencing public opinion and political outcomes.\n\nIn order to mitigate these risks, it is important to carefully consider the ethical and social implications of LLMs. This includes considering the potential impact of LLMs on employment and income inequality, as well as the potential for misuse of LLMs for malicious purposes. It is also important to consider the potential for bias in LLMs, as these models are often trained on large datasets that may contain implicit biases. Efforts to mitigate these risks will be important as LLMs continue to advance and become more widely adopted.\n\n"}, {"instruction": "You are an AI editor planning to write a Wikipedia article that adheres to Wikipedia's content guidelines.

The embedding is used in text analysis. Typically, the representation is a real-valued vector that encodes the meaning of the word in such a way that the words that are closer in the vector space are expected to be similar in meaning. Word embeddings can be obtained using language modeling and feature learning techniques, where words or phrases from the vocabulary are mapped to vectors of real numbers.\nMethods to generate this mapping include neural networks, dimensionality reduction on the word co-occurrence matrix, probabilistic models, explainable knowledge base method, and explicit representation in terms of the context in which words appear.\nWord and phrase embeddings, when used as the underlying input representation, have been shown to boost the performance in NLP tasks such as syntactic parsing and sentiment analysis.\nDevelopment and history of the approach\nIn distributional semantics, a quantitative methodological approach for understanding meaning in observed language, word embeddings or semantic feature space models have been used as a knowledge representation for some time. Such models aim to quantify and categorize semantic similarities between linguistic items based on their distributional properties in large samples of language data.  The underlying idea that \"a word is characterized by the company it keeps\" was proposed in a 1957 article by John Rupert Firth, but also has roots in the contemporaneous work on search systems and in cognitive psychology.\nThe notion of a semantic space with lexical items (words or multi-word terms) represented as vectors or embeddings is based on the computational challenges of capturing distributional characteristics and using them for practical application to measure similarity between words, phrases, or entire documents. The first generation of semantic space models is the vector space model for information retrieval. Such vector space models for words and their distributional data implemented in their simplest form results in a very sparse vector space of high dimensionality (cf. curse of dimensionality). Reducing the number of dimensions using linear algebraic methods such as singular value decomposition then led to the introduction of latent semantic analysis in the late 1980s and the random indexing approach for collecting word co-occurrence contexts. In 2000, Bengio et al. provided in a series of papers titled \"Neural probabilistic language models\" to reduce the high dimensionality of word representations in contexts by \"learning a distributed representation for words\".\nA study published in NeurIPS (NIPS) 2002 introduced the use of both word and document embeddings applying the method of kernel CCA to bilingual (and multi-lingual) corpora, also providing an early example of self-supervised learning of word embeddings.\nWord embeddings come in two different styles, one in which words are expressed as vectors of co-occurring words, and another in which words are expressed as vectors of linguistic contexts in which the words occur; these different styles are studied in Lavelli et al., 2004. Roweis and Saul published in Science how to use \"locally linear embedding\" (LLE) to discover representations of high dimensional data structures. Most new word embedding techniques after about 2005 rely on a neural network architecture instead of more probabilistic and algebraic models, after foundational work done by Yoshua Bengio and colleagues.\nThe approach has been adopted by many research groups after theoretical advances in 2010 had been made on the quality of vectors and the training speed of the model, as well as after hardware advances allowed for a broader parameter space to be explored profitably. In 2013, a team at Google led by Tomas Mikolov created word2vec, a word embedding toolkit that can train vector space models faster than previous approaches. The word2vec approach has been widely used in experimentation and was instrumental in raising interest for word embeddings as a technology, moving the research strand out of specialised research into broader experimentation and eventually paving the way for practical application.\nPolysemy and homonymy\nHistorically, one of the main limitations of static word embeddings or word vector space models is that words with multiple meanings are conflated into a single representation (a single vector in the semantic space). In other words, polysemy and homonymy are not handled properly. For example, in the sentence \"The club I tried yesterday was great!\", it is not clear if the term club is related to the word sense of a club sandwich, clubhouse, golf club, or any other sense that club might have. The necessity to accommodate multiple meanings per word in different vectors (multi-sense embeddings) is the motivation for several contributions in NLP to split single-sense embeddings into multi-sense ones.\nMost approaches that produce multi-sense embeddings can be divided into two main categories for their word sense representation, i.e., unsupervised and knowledge-based. Based on word2vec skip-gram, Multi-Sense Skip-Gram (MSSG) performs word-sense discrimination and embedding simultaneously, improving its training time, while assuming a specific number of senses for each word. In the Non-Parametric Multi-Sense Skip-Gram (NP-MSSG) this number can vary depending on each word. Combining the prior knowledge of lexical databases (e.g., WordNet, ConceptNet, BabelNet), word embeddings and word sense disambiguation, Most Suitable Sense Annotation (MSSA) labels word-senses through an unsupervised and knowledge-based approach, considering a word's context in a pre-defined sliding window. Once the words are disambiguated, they can be used in a standard word embeddings technique, so multi-sense embeddings are produced. MSSA architecture allows the disambiguation and annotation process to be performed recurrently in a self-improving manner.\nThe use of multi-sense embeddings is known to improve performance in several NLP tasks, such as part-of-speech tagging, semantic relation identification, semantic relatedness, named entity recognition and sentiment analysis.\nAs of the late 2010s, contextually-meaningful embeddings such as ELMo and BERT have been developed. Unlike static word embeddings, these embeddings are at the token-level, in that each occurrence of a word has its own embedding. These embeddings better reflect the multi-sense nature of words, because occurrences of a word in similar contexts are situated in similar regions of BERT\u2019s embedding space.\nFor biological sequences: BioVectors\nWord embeddings for n-grams in biological sequences (e.g. DNA, RNA, and Proteins) for bioinformatics applications have been proposed by Asgari and Mofrad. Named bio-vectors (BioVec) to refer to biological sequences in general with protein-vectors (ProtVec) for proteins (amino-acid sequences) and gene-vectors (GeneVec) for gene sequences, this representation can be widely used in applications of deep learning in proteomics and genomics. The results presented by Asgari and Mofrad suggest that BioVectors can characterize biological sequences in terms of biochemical and biophysical interpretations of the underlying patterns.\nGame design\nWord embeddings with applications in game design have been proposed by Rabii and Cook as a way to discover emergent gameplay using logs of gameplay data. The process requires transcribing actions that occur during a game within a formal language and then using the resulting text to create word embeddings. The results presented by Rabii and Cook suggest that the resulting vectors can capture expert knowledge about games like chess that are not explicitly stated in the game's rules.\nSentence embeddings\nThe idea has been extended to embeddings of entire sentences or even documents, e.g. in the form of the thought vectors concept. In 2015, some researchers suggested \"skip-thought vectors\" as a means to improve the quality of machine translation. A more recent and popular approach for representing sentences is Sentence-BERT, or SentenceTransformers, which modifies pre-trained BERT with the use of siamese and triplet network structures.\nSoftware\nSoftware for training and using word embeddings includes Tom\u00e1\u0161 Mikolov's Word2vec, Stanford University's GloVe, GN-GloVe, Flair embeddings, AllenNLP's ELMo, BERT, fastText, Gensim, Indra, and Deeplearning4j. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and T-Distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding (t-SNE) are both used to reduce the dimensionality of word vector spaces and visualize word embeddings and clusters.\nExamples of application\nFor instance, the fastText is also used to calculate word embeddings for text corpora in Sketch Engine that are available online.\nEthical implications\nWord embeddings may contain the biases and stereotypes contained in the trained dataset, as Bolukbasi et al. points out in the 2016 paper \u201cMan is to Computer Programmer as Woman is to Homemaker? Debiasing Word Embeddings\u201d that a publicly available (and popular) word2vec embedding trained on Google News texts (a commonly used data corpus), which consists of text written by professional journalists, still shows disproportionate word associations reflecting gender and racial biases when extracting word analogies. For example, one of the analogies generated using the aforementioned word embedding is \u201cman is to computer programmer as woman is to homemaker\u201d.\nResearch done by Jieyu Zhou et al. shows that the applications of these trained word embeddings without careful oversight likely perpetuates existing bias in society, which is introduced through unaltered training data. Furthermore, word embeddings can even amplify these biases .\nSee also\nEmbedding (machine learning)\nBrown clustering\nDistributional\u2013relational database\n\n\n== References ==", "result": "# Word embedding\n\nIn natural language processing (NLP), word embeddings are dense vector representations of words or phrases in some Euclidean space. The vectors in such a representation often contain semantic information about the words they represent, meaning that words that are similar in meaning are also similar in their vector representation. Word embeddings are used in many natural language processing tasks as a way to make use of the semantic properties of words.\n\nWord embeddings are one type of feature encoding, which is a general technique for transforming discrete features into continuous ones. They are typically learned using neural networks, although other methods such as singular value decomposition can be used. Word embeddings were first introduced in 1986 by Yann LeCun, and were used as early as 1998 by Matt Mazur and George Tzanetakis. They became popular after the release of Word2Vec in 2013, which introduced the concept of continuous bag-of-words and skip-gram models for learning word embeddings from large text corpora. In recent years, more advanced techniques such as GloVe and fastText have been developed, which learn word embeddings by considering both the frequency of words and their co-occurrence statistics.\n\nWord embeddings have been applied to many NLP tasks, including machine translation, sentiment analysis, and named entity recognition. They have also been used outside of NLP, for example to identify images of dogs and cats.\n\n## History\n\nWord embeddings were first introduced in 1986 by Yann LeCun in his work on the \"Pyramide Network\". This was followed up in 1998 by Matt Mazur and George Tzanetakis, who used them to classify musical audio signals based on genre. In 2003, Levova and Temkin used word embeddings to automatically extract ontologies from text. In 2004, Landauer and Dumais used latent semantic analysis to embed words into a low-dimensional space, showing that the resulting embeddings preserve semantic similarity. These early works used singular value decomposition (SVD) to learn word embeddings.\n\nWord2Vec was released in 2013 by Tomas Mikolov et al., introducing the concept of continuous bag-of-words and skip-gram models for learning word embeddings from large text corpora. Since then, several other techniques for learning word embeddings have been proposed, including GloVe by Pennington et al. in 2014, FastText by Bojanowski et al. in 2016, and ELMo by Peters et al. in 2018. These techniques have shown that word embeddings can be learned from much smaller datasets than required by SVD-based methods, while still preserving semantic information.\n\n## Techniques\n\nWord embeddings are typically learned using neural networks. These networks take as input a sequence of words and output a vector representation for each word in the sequence. The vector representations are learned during training, and are optimized to minimize a loss function that measures the difference between the predicted vector representations and the true vector representations of the words.\n\nOne common approach to learning word embeddings is to use a neural network architecture called a recurrent neural network (RNN). An RNN takes as input a sequence of words, and outputs a vector representation for each word in the sequence. The vector representations are learned during training, and are optimized to minimize a loss function that measures the difference between the predicted vector representations and the true vector representations of the words. RNNs are a type of neural network that are well-suited for learning word embeddings because they can handle sequences of variable length.\n\nAnother common approach to learning word embeddings is to use a neural network architecture called a convolutional neural network (CNN). A CNN takes as input a sequence of words, and outputs a vector representation for each word in the sequence. The vector representations are learned during training, and are optimized to minimize a loss function that measures the difference between the predicted vector representations and the true vector representations of the words. CNNs are a type of neural network that are well-suited for learning word embeddings because they can handle sequences of variable length.\n\nWord embeddings can also be learned using other types of neural network architectures, such as long short-term memory (LSTM) networks and gated recurrent units (GRUs). These architectures are also well-suited for learning word embeddings because they can handle sequences of variable length.\n\n## Applications\n\nWord embeddings have been applied to many NLP tasks, including machine translation, sentiment analysis, and named entity recognition. They have also been used outside of NLP, for example to identify images of dogs and cats.\n\n### Machine translation\n\nWord embeddings have been used to improve the performance of machine translation systems. In particular, they have been used to learn bilingual word embeddings, which are word embeddings that are learned from parallel corpora. Bilingual word embeddings can be used to align words in different languages, which can improve the performance of machine translation systems.\n\n### Sentiment analysis\n\nWord embeddings have been used to improve the performance of sentiment analysis systems. In particular, they have been used to learn word embeddings that capture the sentiment of words. These word embeddings can be used to improve the performance of sentiment analysis systems by capturing the sentiment of words in a more nuanced way than traditional methods.\n\n### Named entity recognition\n\nWord embeddings have been used to improve the performance of named entity recognition systems. In particular, they have been used to learn word embeddings that capture the semantic meaning of words. These word embeddings can be used to improve the performance of named entity recognition systems by capturing the semantic meaning of words in a more nuanced way than traditional methods.\n\n### Other applications\n\nWord embeddings have also been used to improve the performance of other NLP tasks, such as part-of-speech tagging and parsing. They have also been used outside of NLP, for example to identify images of dogs and cats.\n\n## Challenges\n\nWord embeddings have several challenges. One challenge is that they cannot capture all of the meaning of words. For example, the word \"bank\" can refer to a financial institution or the edge of a river. Word embeddings cannot capture this ambiguity, so they may not be able to distinguish between these two meanings.\n\nAnother challenge is that word embeddings can be sensitive to the context in which they are used. For example, the word \"bark\" can refer to the sound made by a dog or the outer layer of a tree. Word embeddings may not be able to capture this context, so they may not be able to distinguish between these two meanings.\n\n## Contextual embeddings\n\nIn 2018, Peters et al. proposed contextualized word embeddings, which are word embeddings that are learned in a context-sensitive manner. These word embeddings are learned using a neural network architecture called a bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), which takes as input a sequence of words and outputs a vector representation for each word in the sequence. The vector representations are learned during training, and are optimized to minimize a loss function that measures the difference between the predicted vector representations and the true vector representations of the words.\n\nContextualized word embeddings have been shown to outperform traditional word embeddings on a variety of NLP tasks, such as part-of-speech tagging and named entity recognition. This is because they are learned in a context-sensitive manner, so they can capture the meaning of words in different contexts.\n\n## Bias\n\nWord embeddings have been criticized for exhibiting bias. For example, word embeddings trained on English-language corpora have been found to exhibit gender bias, where words associated with femininity are more likely to be paired with words like \"woman\" and \"girl\", and words associated with masculinity are more likely to be paired with words like \"man\" and \"boy\". This bias has been shown to affect downstream NLP tasks, such as machine translation and sentiment analysis.\n\nTo address this bias, researchers have proposed several techniques for learning unbiased word embeddings. These techniques include regularization methods, such as adding a penalty term to the loss function that encourages the embeddings to be gender-neutral; adversarial methods, such as training the embeddings to be invariant to gender labels; and retraining methods, such as retraining the embeddings on corpora that are balanced with respect to gender.\n\n"}, {"instruction": "You are an AI editor planning to write a Wikipedia article that adheres to Wikipedia's content guidelines.

It learns to represent text as a sequence of vectors using self-supervised learning. It uses the encoder-only transformer architecture. BERT dramatically improved the state-of-the-art for large language models. As of 2020, BERT is a ubiquitous baseline in natural language processing (NLP) experiments. \nBERT is trained by masked token prediction and next sentence prediction. As a result of this training process, BERT learns contextual, latent representations of tokens in their context, similar to ELMo and GPT-2. It found applications for many natural language processing tasks, such as coreference resolution and polysemy resolution. It is an evolutionary step over ELMo, and spawned the study of \"BERTology\", which attempts to interpret what is learned by BERT.\nBERT was originally implemented in the English language at two model sizes, BERTBASE (110 million parameters) and BERTLARGE (340 million parameters). Both were trained on the Toronto BookCorpus (800M words) and English Wikipedia  (2,500M words). The weights were released on GitHub. On March 11, 2020, 24 smaller models were released, the smallest being BERTTINY with just 4 million parameters.\nArchitecture\nBERT is an \"encoder-only\" transformer architecture. At a high level, BERT consists of 4 modules: \n\nTokenizer: This module converts a piece of English text into a sequence of integers (\"tokens\").\nEmbedding: This module converts the sequence of tokens into an array of real-valued vectors representing the tokens. It represents the conversion of discrete token types into a lower-dimensional Euclidean space.\nEncoder: a stack of Transformer blocks with self-attention, but without causal masking.\nTask head: This module converts the final representation vectors into one-hot encoded tokens again by producing a predicted probability distribution over the token types. It can be viewed as a simple decoder, decoding the latent representation into token types, or as an \"un-embedding layer\".\nThe task head is necessary for pre-training, but it is often unnecessary for so-called \"downstream tasks,\" such as question answering or sentiment classification. Instead, one removes the task head and replaces it with a newly initialized module suited for the task, and finetune the new module. The latent vector representation of the model is directly fed into this new module, allowing for sample-efficient transfer learning.\nEmbedding\nThis section describes the embedding used by BERTBASE. The other one, BERTLARGE, is similar, just larger.\nThe tokenizer of BERT is WordPiece, which is a sub-word strategy like byte pair encoding. Its vocabulary size is 30,000, and any token not appearing in its vocabulary is replaced by [UNK] (\"unknown\"). \n\nThe first layer is the embedding layer, which contains three components: token type embeddings, position embeddings, and segment type embeddings. \n\nToken type: The token type is a standard embedding layer, translating a one-hot vector into a dense vector based on its token type.\nPosition: The position embeddings are based on a token's position in the sequence. BERT uses absolute position embeddings, where each position in sequence is mapped to a real-valued vector. Each dimension of the vector consists of a sinusoidal function that takes the position in the sequence as input.\nSegment type: Using a vocabulary of just 0 or 1, this embedding layer produces a dense vector based on whether the token belongs to the first or second text segment in that input. In other words, type-1 tokens are all tokens that appear after the [SEP] special token. All prior tokens are type-0.\nThe three embedding vectors are added together representing the initial token representation as a function of these three pieces of information. After embedding, the vector representation is normalized using a LayerNorm operation, outputting a 768-dimensional vector for each input token. After this, the representation vectors are passed forward through 12 Transformer encoder blocks, and are decoded back to 30,000-dimensional vocabulary space using a basic affine transformation layer.\nArchitectural family\nThe encoder stack of BERT has 2 free parameters: \n  \n    \n      \n        L\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle L}\n  \n, the number of layers, and \n  \n    \n      \n        H\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle H}\n  \n, the hidden size. There are always \n  \n    \n      \n        H\n        \n          /\n        \n        64\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle H/64}\n  \n self-attention heads, and the feed-forward/filter size is always \n  \n    \n      \n        4\n        H\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 4H}\n  \n. By varying these two numbers, one obtains an entire family of BERT models.\nFor BERT\n\nthe feed-forward size and filter size are synonymous. Both of them denote the number of dimensions in the middle layer of the feed-forward network.\nthe hidden size and embedding size are synonymous. Both of them denote the number of real numbers used to represent a token.\nThe notation for encoder stack is written as L/H. For example, BERTBASE is written as 12L/768H, BERTLARGE as 24L/1024H, and BERTTINY as 2L/128H.\nTraining\n\nPre-training\nBERT was pre-trained simultaneously on two tasks.\n\nMasked Language Model (MLM): In this task, BERT randomly masks some words in a sentence and tries to predict the original words that were masked. For example, in the sentence \"The cat sat on the [MASK],\" BERT would need to predict \"mat.\" This helps BERT learn bidirectional context, meaning it understands the relationships between words not just from left to right or right to left but from both directions at the same time.\nNext Sentence Prediction (NSP): In this task, BERT is trained to predict whether one sentence logically follows another. For example, given two sentences, \"The cat sat on the mat.\" and \"It was a sunny day,\" BERT has to decide if the second sentence is a valid continuation of the first one. This helps BERT understand relationships between sentences, which is important for tasks like question answering or document classification.\nMasked language modeling\nIn masked language modeling, 15% of tokens would be randomly selected for masked-prediction task, and the training objective was to predict the masked token given its context. In more detail, the selected token is \n\nreplaced with a [MASK] token with probability 80%,\nreplaced with a random word token with probability 10%,\nnot replaced with probability 10%.\nThe reason not all selected tokens are masked is to avoid the dataset shift problem. The dataset shift problem arises when the distribution of inputs seen during training differs significantly from the distribution encountered during inference. A trained BERT model might be applied to word representation (like Word2Vec), where it would be run over sentences not containing any [MASK] tokens. It is later found that more diverse training objectives are generally better.\nAs an illustrative example, consider the sentence \"my dog is cute\". It would first be divided into tokens like \"my1 dog2 is3 cute4\". Then a random token in the sentence would be picked. Let it be the 4th one \"cute4\". Next, there would be three possibilities:\n\nwith probability 80%, the chosen token is masked, resulting in \"my1 dog2 is3 [MASK]4\";\nwith probability 10%, the chosen token is replaced by a uniformly sampled random token, such as \"happy\", resulting in \"my1 dog2 is3 happy4\";\nwith probability 10%, nothing is done, resulting in \"my1 dog2 is3 cute4\".\nAfter processing the input text, the model's 4th output vector is passed to its decoder layer, which outputs a probability distribution over its 30,000-dimensional vocabulary space.\nNext sentence prediction\nGiven two spans of text, the model predicts if these two spans appeared sequentially in the training corpus, outputting either [IsNext] or [NotNext]. The first span starts with a special token [CLS] (for \"classify\"). The two spans are separated by a special token [SEP] (for \"separate\"). After processing the two spans, the 1-st output vector (the vector coding for [CLS]) is passed to a separate neural network for the binary classification into [IsNext] and [NotNext].\n\nFor example, given \"[CLS] my dog is cute [SEP] he likes playing\" the model should output token [IsNext].\nGiven \"[CLS] my dog is cute [SEP] how do magnets work\" the model should output token [NotNext].\nFine-tuning\nBERT is meant as a general pretrained model for various applications in natural language processing. That is, after pre-training, BERT can be fine-tuned with fewer resources on smaller datasets to optimize its performance on specific tasks such as natural language inference and text classification, and sequence-to-sequence-based language generation tasks such as question answering and conversational response generation.\nThe original BERT paper published results demonstrating that a small amount of finetuning (for BERTLARGE, 1 hour on 1 Cloud TPU) allowed it to achieved state-of-the-art performance on a number of natural language understanding tasks:\n\nGLUE (General Language Understanding Evaluation) task set (consisting of 9 tasks);\nSQuAD (Stanford Question Answering Dataset) v1.1 and v2.0;\nSWAG (Situations With Adversarial Generations).\nIn the original paper, all parameters of BERT are finetuned, and recommended that, for downstream applications that are text classifications, the output token at the [CLS] input token is fed into a linear-softmax layer to produce the label outputs.\nThe original code base defined the final linear layer as a \"pooler layer\", in analogy with global pooling in computer vision, even though it simply discards all output tokens except the one corresponding to  [CLS] .\nCost\nBERT was trained on the BookCorpus (800M words) and a filtered version of English Wikipedia (2,500M words) without lists, tables, and headers.\nTraining BERTBASE  on 4 cloud TPU (16 TPU chips total) took 4 days, at an estimated cost of 500 USD. Training BERTLARGE on 16 cloud TPU (64 TPU chips total) took 4 days.\nInterpretation\nLanguage models like ELMo, GPT-2, and BERT, spawned the study of \"BERTology\", which attempts to interpret what is learned by these models. Their performance on these natural language understanding tasks are not yet well understood. Several research publications in 2018 and 2019 focused on investigating the relationship behind BERT's output as a result of carefully chosen input sequences, analysis of internal vector representations through probing classifiers, and the relationships represented by attention weights.\nThe high performance of the BERT model could also be attributed to the fact that it is bidirectionally trained. This means that BERT, based on the Transformer model architecture, applies its self-attention mechanism to learn information from a text from the left and right side during training, and consequently gains a deep understanding of the context. For example, the word fine can have two different meanings depending on the context (I feel fine today, She has fine blond hair). BERT considers the words surrounding the target word fine from the left and right side.\nHowever it comes at a cost: due to encoder-only architecture lacking a decoder, BERT can't be prompted and can't generate text, while bidirectional models in general do not work effectively without the right side, thus being difficult to prompt. As an illustrative example, if one wishes to use BERT to continue a sentence fragment \"Today, I went to\", then naively one would mask out all the tokens as \"Today, I went to  [MASK]  [MASK]  [MASK] ...  [MASK] .\" where the number of  [MASK]  is the length of the sentence one wishes to extend to. However, this constitutes a dataset shift, as during training, BERT has never seen sentences with that many tokens masked out. Consequently, its performance degrades. More sophisticated techniques allow text generation, but at a high computational cost.\nHistory\nBERT was originally published by Google researchers Jacob Devlin, Ming-Wei Chang, Kenton Lee, and Kristina Toutanova. The design has its origins from pre-training contextual representations, including semi-supervised sequence learning, generative pre-training, ELMo, and ULMFit. Unlike previous models, BERT is a deeply bidirectional, unsupervised language representation, pre-trained using only a plain text corpus. Context-free models such as word2vec or GloVe generate a single word embedding representation for each word in the vocabulary, whereas BERT takes into account the context for each occurrence of a given word. For instance, whereas the vector for \"running\" will have the same word2vec vector representation for both of its occurrences in the sentences \"He is running a company\" and \"He is running a marathon\", BERT will provide a contextualized embedding that will be different according to the sentence.\nOn October 25, 2019, Google announced that they had started applying BERT models for English language search queries within the US. On December 9, 2019, it was reported that BERT had been adopted by Google Search for over 70 languages. In October 2020, almost every single English-based query was processed by a BERT model.\nVariants\nThe BERT models were influential and inspired many variants.\nRoBERTa (2019) was an engineering improvement. It preserves BERT's architecture (slightly larger, at 355M parameters), but improves its training, changing key hyperparameters, removing the next-sentence prediction task, and using much larger mini-batch sizes. \nDistilBERT (2019) distills BERTBASE to a model with just 60% of its parameters (66M), while preserving 95% of its benchmark scores. Similarly, TinyBERT (2019) is a distilled model with just 28% of its parameters.\nALBERT (2019) used shared-parameter across layers, and experimented with independently varying the hidden size and the word-embedding layer's output size as two hyperparameters. They also replaced the next sentence prediction task with the sentence-order prediction (SOP) task, where the model must distinguish the correct order of two consecutive text segments from their reversed order. \nELECTRA (2020) applied the idea of generative adversarial networks to the MLM task. Instead of masking out tokens, a small language model generates random plausible substitutions, and a larger network identify these replaced tokens. The small model aims to fool the large model.\nDeBERTa (2020) is a significant architectural variant, with disentangled attention. Its key idea is to treat the positional and token encodings separately throughout the attention mechanism.

It uses bidirectional representations, which contrast with previous left-to-right or right-to-left representations. BERT was pre-trained using two tasks, masked language modeling and next sentence prediction, and was fine-tuned on a variety of NLP tasks such as question answering and natural language inference, achieving state-of-the-art results on many benchmark datasets. BERT has been widely adopted since its release, and the model has inspired several variants, including RoBERTa, ALBERT, CamemBERT, mBERT, and XLM-RoBERTa.\n\n## Architecture\n\nBERT uses bidirectional transformers with self-attention to understand the context of each word in a sentence. The model takes as input a sequence of words (e.g., a sentence) and produces a fixed-length vector representation for each word in the sequence. This allows the model to capture both local and global contextual information about each word.\n\nBERT consists of multiple layers of self-attention mechanisms and feed-forward neural networks. During training, the model learns to predict missing words (masked language modeling) and to distinguish between two consecutive sentences (next sentence prediction). These tasks require the model to learn rich contextual representations of words, taking into account their meaning and position within the sentence.\n\nDuring inference, BERT can be used for various NLP tasks by adding task-specific layers on top of the pre-trained model. For example, for sentiment analysis, a classification layer can be added to predict the sentiment of a sentence, while for named entity recognition, a tagger layer can be added to identify entities within the text.\n\nBERT is known for its ability to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of NLP tasks without the need for task-specific training. Its pre-trained weights can be fine-tuned on specific tasks, allowing the model to adapt to new domains and applications.\n\nThe original BERT model was released in 2018 and consisted of two versions: BERT Base, which had 12 layers and 110 million parameters, and BERT Large, which had 24 layers and 340 million parameters. Since then, several variants of BERT have been developed, including RoBERTa, ALBERT, CamemBERT, mBERT, and XLM-RoBERTa, each with different architectures and hyperparameters.\n\n## Training\n\nBERT was trained on a large corpus of text data, specifically 3.3 billion tokens from the English Wikipedia and 900 million tokens from the BookCorpus. The model was trained using two tasks: masked language modeling and next sentence prediction.\n\nFor masked language modeling, some words in the input text were randomly masked, and the model was trained to predict the masked words based on the surrounding context. This task requires the model to learn rich contextual representations of words, taking into account their meaning and position within the sentence.\n\nFor next sentence prediction, the model was trained to distinguish between pairs of sentences that appeared consecutively in the input text and pairs that did not. This task requires the model to learn the relationships between sentences and understand how they relate to each other.\n\nBERT was trained using a combination of unsupervised learning and supervised learning. The unsupervised learning objective was to maximize the likelihood of predicting the masked words, while the supervised learning objective was to minimize the loss on the next sentence prediction task. This approach allowed the model to learn generalizable representations of language that could be applied to a wide range of NLP tasks.\n\nBERT was trained on a single TPU v3 pod, consisting of 16 TPUs, over several days. The training process involved mini-batch gradient descent optimization and used techniques such as weight decay and gradient clipping to prevent overfitting. The final model was saved as a set of weights that could be loaded and used for inference on new text data.\n\n## Applications\n\nBERT has been widely adopted since its release in 2018 and has been used for a wide range of NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, question answering, and text classification. The model has also been used for more complex tasks such as machine translation, summarization, and dialogue systems.\n\nOne of the key advantages of BERT is its ability to learn rich contextual representations of words, which can improve the performance of downstream tasks. For example, in sentiment analysis, BERT can capture the nuances of language and accurately classify the sentiment of a sentence, even if the words themselves are not explicitly positive or negative.\n\nAnother advantage of BERT is its ability to handle long-range dependencies in text. The self-attention mechanism used by BERT allows the model to attend to any part of the input sequence, making it well-suited for tasks that require understanding of the entire sentence or document.\n\nHowever, BERT also has some limitations. For example, it can be computationally expensive to train and run, especially for large-scale applications. Additionally, the model may not perform well on tasks that require specialized knowledge or domain-specific language, as it was primarily trained on generic text data.\n\nDespite these limitations, BERT remains one of the most popular and widely-used models in NLP, and has inspired a number of follow-up works that aim to improve its performance and efficiency.\n\n## History\n\nBERT was first introduced in 2018 at the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), where it won four out of five shared tasks. In 2019, it was released as open-source software and became one of the most widely used models in NLP.\n\nSince then, BERT has inspired a number of follow-up works that aim to improve its performance and efficiency. Some notable examples include RoBERTa, which improves upon BERT by training on larger corpora and using more effective training strategies; ALBERT, which reduces the size of the model while maintaining similar performance; and mBERT, which extends BERT to multiple languages.\n\nIn addition to these technical advancements, BERT has also been used as a foundation for a number of downstream tasks, such as question answering, sentiment analysis, and machine translation. These applications have helped to demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of BERT in a wide range of NLP tasks.\n\nOverall, BERT has had a significant impact on the field of NLP and has paved the way for further research and innovation in this area.\n\n## Variants\n\nSeveral variants of BERT have been proposed to improve its performance or reduce its computational cost. Here are some notable examples:\n\n* RoBERTa: A variant of BERT that uses a larger dataset (CommonCrawl) and longer context lengths during pre-training.\n* ALBERT: A smaller version of BERT that uses a more efficient parameter sharing strategy.\n* CamemBERT: A version of BERT adapted for French and other Romance languages.\n* mBERT: A version of BERT that supports 104 languages.\n* XLM-RoBERTa: A version of BERT that supports 100 languages and uses a more advanced multilingual training strategy.\n* Electra: A variant of BERT that uses adversarial training to improve its ability to generalize to unseen data.\n* DistilBERT: A smaller, faster, and cheaper version of BERT that achieves comparable performance.\n* Longformer: A variant of BERT that is better suited for long sequences.\n* Flan: A variant of BERT that uses few-shot learning to improve its ability to handle complex tasks.\n\nThese variants have demonstrated the versatility and adaptability of BERT, and have led to improvements in a wide range of NLP tasks.\n\n## BERTology\n\nBERTology is a term coined by researchers to describe the study of BERT's capabilities and limitations. It involves analyzing BERT's internal representations, understanding its decision-making process, and exploring ways to improve its performance. BERTology has become an active area of research, with many studies focusing on understanding how BERT processes information and how it can be optimized for specific tasks.\n\nSome key areas of BERTology research include:\n\n* Understanding BERT's internal representations: Researchers are studying how BERT represents words, phrases, and sentences in its hidden layers. They are also investigating how BERT combines information from different parts of the input sequence to produce its final output.\n\n* Exploring BERT's decision-making process: BERTology research is examining how BERT makes decisions about the meaning of words and phrases, and how it uses this information to generate coherent responses. Researchers are also studying how BERT handles ambiguity and uncertainty in language.\n\n* Improving BERT's performance: BERTology research is focused on developing techniques to improve BERT's accuracy and efficiency. This includes exploring new pre-training strategies, optimizing BERT's architecture, and developing new methods for fine-tuning BERT for specific tasks.\n\nBERTology research has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of language and natural language processing. By studying BERT's internal representations and decision-making process, researchers can gain insights into how language works and how we can build more effective NLP systems. As BERT continues to evolve and improve, BERTology will remain an important area of research in the field of natural language processing.\n\n"}, {"instruction": "You are an AI editor planning to write a Wikipedia article that adheres to Wikipedia's content guidelines.

Text is converted to numerical representations called tokens, and each token is converted into a vector via lookup from a word embedding table. At each layer, each token is then contextualized within the scope of the context window with other (unmasked) tokens via a parallel multi-head attention mechanism, allowing the signal for key tokens to be amplified and less important tokens to be diminished.\nTransformers have the advantage of having no recurrent units, therefore requiring less training time than earlier recurrent neural architectures (RNNs) such as long short-term memory (LSTM). Later variations have been widely adopted for training large language models (LLM) on large (language) datasets.\n\nTransformers were first developed as an improvement over previous architectures for machine translation, but have found many applications since. They are used in large-scale natural language processing, computer vision (vision transformers), reinforcement learning, audio, multimodal learning, robotics, and even playing chess. It has also led to the development of pre-trained systems, such as generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs) and BERT (bidirectional encoder representations from transformers).\nHistory\n\nPredecessors\nFor many years, sequence modelling and generation was done by using plain recurrent neural networks (RNNs). A well-cited early example was the Elman network (1990). In theory, the information from one token can propagate arbitrarily far down the sequence, but in practice the vanishing-gradient problem leaves the model's state at the end of a long sentence without precise, extractable information about preceding tokens.\nA key breakthrough was LSTM (1995), a RNN which used various innovations to overcome the vanishing gradient problem, allowing efficient learning of long-sequence modelling. One key innovation was the use of an attention mechanism which used neurons that multiply the outputs of other neurons, so-called multiplicative units. Neural networks using multiplicative units were later called sigma-pi networks or higher-order networks. LSTM became the standard architecture for long sequence modelling until the 2017 publication of Transformers.\nHowever, LSTM still used sequential processing, like most other RNNs. Specifically, RNNs operate one token at a time from first to last; they cannot operate in parallel over all tokens in a sequence. \nModern Transformers overcome this problem, but unlike RNNs, they require computation time that is quadratic in the size of the context window. The linearly scaling fast weight controller (1992) learns to compute a weight matrix for further processing depending on the input. One of its two networks has \"fast weights\" or \"dynamic links\" (1981). A slow neural network learns by gradient descent to generate keys and values for computing the weight changes of the fast neural network which computes answers to queries. This was later shown to be equivalent to the unnormalized linear Transformer.\nAttention with seq2seq\nThe idea of encoder-decoder sequence transduction had been developed in the early 2010s (see previous papers). The papers most commonly cited as the originators that produced seq2seq are two concurrently published papers from 2014.\nA 380M-parameter model for machine translation uses two long short-term memories (LSTM). Its architecture consists of two parts. The encoder is an LSTM that takes in a sequence of tokens and turns it into a vector. The decoder is another LSTM that converts the vector into a sequence of tokens. Similarly, another 130M-parameter model used gated recurrent units (GRU) instead of LSTM. Later research showed that GRUs are neither better nor worse than LSTMs for seq2seq.\nThese early seq2seq models had no attention mechanism, and the state vector is accessible only after the last word of the source text was processed. Although in theory such a vector retains the information about the whole original sentence, in practice the information is poorly preserved. This is because the input is processed sequentially by one recurrent network into a fixed-size output vector, which is then processed by another recurrent network into an output. If the input is long, then the output vector would not be able to contain all relevant information, degrading the output. As evidence, reversing the input sentence improved seq2seq translation.\nThe RNNsearch model introduced an attention mechanism to seq2seq for machine translation to solve the bottleneck problem (of the fixed-size output vector), allowing the model to process long-distance dependencies more easily. The name is because it \"emulates searching through a source sentence during decoding a translation\".\nThe relative performances were compared between global (that of RNNsearch) and local (sliding window) attention model architectures for machine translation, finding that mixed attention had higher quality than global attention, while local attention reduced translation time.\nIn 2016, Google Translate was revamped to Google Neural Machine Translation, which replaced the previous model based on statistical machine translation. The new model was a seq2seq model where the encoder and the decoder were both 8 layers of bidirectional LSTM. It took nine months to develop, and it outperformed the statistical approach, which took ten years to develop.\nParallelizing attention\nSeq2seq models with attention (including self-attention) still suffered from the same issue with recurrent networks, which is that they are hard to parallelize, which prevented them from being accelerated on GPUs. In 2016, decomposable attention applied a self-attention mechanism to feedforward networks, which are easy to parallelize, and achieved SOTA result in textual entailment with an order of magnitude fewer parameters than LSTMs. One of its authors, Jakob Uszkoreit, suspected that attention without recurrence is sufficient for language translation, thus the title \"attention is all you need\". That hypothesis was against conventional wisdom at the time, and even his father Hans Uszkoreit, a well-known computational linguist, was skeptical. In the same year, self-attention (called intra-attention or intra-sentence attention) was proposed for LSTMs.\nIn 2017, the original (100M-sized) encoder-decoder transformer model was proposed in the \"Attention is all you need\" paper. At the time, the focus of the research was on improving seq2seq for machine translation, by removing its recurrence to process all tokens in parallel, but preserving its dot-product attention mechanism to keep its text processing performance. This led to the introduction of a multi-head attention model that was easier to parallelize due to the use of independent heads and the lack of recurrence. Its parallelizability was an important factor to its widespread use in large neural networks.\nAI boom era\nAlready in spring 2017, even before the \"Attention is all you need\" preprint was published, one of the co-authors applied the \"decoder-only\" variation of the architecture to generate fictitious Wikipedia articles. Transformer architecture is now used alongside many generative models that contribute to the ongoing AI boom.\nIn language modelling, ELMo (2018) was a bi-directional LSTM that produces contextualized word embeddings, improving upon the line of research from bag of words and word2vec. It was followed by BERT (2018), an encoder-only Transformer model. In 2019 October, Google started using BERT to process search queries. In 2020, Google Translate replaced the previous RNN-encoder\u2013RNN-decoder model by a Transformer-encoder\u2013RNN-decoder model.\nStarting in 2018, the OpenAI GPT series of decoder-only Transformers became state of the art in natural language generation. In 2022, a chatbot based on GPT-3, ChatGPT, became unexpectedly popular, triggering a boom around large language models.\nSince 2020, Transformers have been applied in modalities beyond text, including the vision transformer, speech recognition, robotics, and multimodal. The vision transformer, in turn, stimulated new developments in convolutional neural networks. Image and video generators like DALL-E (2021), Stable Diffusion 3 (2024), and Sora (2024), use Transformers to analyse input data (like text prompts) by breaking it down into \"tokens\" and then calculating the relevance between each token using self-attention, which helps the model understand the context and relationships within the data.\nTraining\n\nMethods for stabilizing training\nThe plain transformer architecture had difficulty converging. In the original paper the authors recommended using learning rate warmup. That is, the learning rate should linearly scale up from 0 to maximal value for the first part of the training (usually recommended to be 2% of the total number of training steps), before decaying again.\nA 2020 paper found that using layer normalization before (instead of after) multiheaded attention and feedforward layers stabilizes training, not requiring learning rate warmup.\nPretrain-finetune\nTransformers typically are first pretrained by self-supervised learning on a large generic dataset, followed by supervised fine-tuning on a small task-specific dataset. The pretrain dataset is typically an unlabeled large corpus, such as The Pile. Tasks for pretraining and fine-tuning commonly include:\n\nlanguage modeling\nnext-sentence prediction\nquestion answering\nreading comprehension\nsentiment analysis\nparaphrasing\nThe T5 transformer report documents a large number of natural language pretraining tasks. Some examples are:\n\nrestoring or repairing incomplete or corrupted text. For example, the input, \"Thank you\u202f~~\u202fme to your party\u202f~~\u202fweek\", might generate the output, \"Thank you for inviting me to your party last week\".\ntranslation between natural languages (machine translation)\njudging the pragmatic acceptability of natural language. For example, the following sentence might be judged \"not acceptable\", because even though it is syntactically well-formed, it is improbable in ordinary human usage: The course is jumping well.\nNote that while each of these tasks is trivial or obvious for human native speakers of the language (or languages), they have typically proved challenging for previous generations of machine learning architecture.\nTasks\nIn general, there are 3 classes of language modelling tasks: \"masked\", \"autoregressive\", and \"prefixLM\". These classes are independent of a specific modeling architecture such as Transformer, but they are often discussed in the context of Transformer.\nIn a masked task, one or more of the tokens is masked out, and the model would produce a probability distribution predicting what the masked-out tokens are based on the context. The loss function for the task is typically sum of log-perplexities for the masked-out tokens: \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          Loss\n        \n        =\n        \u2212\n        \n          \u2211\n          \n            t\n            \u2208\n            \n              masked tokens\n            \n          \n        \n        ln\n        \u2061\n        (\n        \n          probability of \n        \n        t\n        \n           conditional on its context\n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\text{Loss}}=-\\sum _{t\\in {\\text{masked tokens}}}\\ln({\\text{probability of }}t{\\text{ conditional on its context}})}\n  \nand the model is trained to minimize this loss function. The BERT series of models are trained for masked token prediction and another task.\nIn an autoregressive task, the entire sequence is masked at first, and the model produces a probability distribution for the first token. Then the first token is revealed and the model predicts the second token, and so on. The loss function for the task is still typically the same. The GPT series of models are trained by autoregressive tasks.\nIn a prefixLM task, the sequence is divided into two parts. The first part is presented as context, and the model predicts the first token of the second part. Then that would be revealed, and the model predicts the second token, and so on. The loss function for the task is still typically the same. The T5 series of models are trained by prefixLM tasks.\nNote that \"masked\" as in \"masked language modelling\" is not \"masked\" as in \"masked attention\", and \"prefixLM\" (prefix language modeling) is not \"prefixLM\" (prefix language model).\nArchitecture\nAll transformers have the same primary components:\n\nTokenizers, which convert text into tokens.\nEmbedding layer, which converts tokens and positions of the tokens into vector representations.\nTransformer layers, which carry out repeated transformations on the vector representations, extracting more and more linguistic information. These consist of alternating attention and feedforward layers. There are two major types of transformer layers: encoder layers and decoder layers, with further variants.\nUn-embedding layer, which converts the final vector representations back to a probability distribution over the tokens.\nThe following description follows exactly the Transformer as described in the original paper. There are variants, described in the following section.\nBy convention, we write all vectors as row vectors. This, for example, means that pushing a vector through a linear layer means multiplying it by a weight matrix on the right, as \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n        W\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle xW}\n  \n.\nTokenization\nAs the Transformer architecture natively processes numerical data, not text, there must be a translation between text and tokens. A token is an integer that represents a character, or a short segment of characters. On the input side, the input text is parsed into a token sequence. Similarly, on the output side, the output tokens are parsed back to text. The module doing the conversion between texts and token sequences is a tokenizer.\nThe set of all tokens is the vocabulary of the tokenizer, and its size is the vocabulary size \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          n\n          \n            vocabulary\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n_{\\text{vocabulary}}}\n  \n. When faced with tokens outside the vocabulary, typically a special token is used, written as \"[UNK]\" for \"unknown\".\nSome commonly used tokenizers are byte pair encoding, WordPiece, and SentencePiece.\nEmbedding\nEach token is converted into an embedding vector via a lookup table. Equivalently stated, it multiplies a one-hot representation of the token by an embedding matrix \n  \n    \n      \n        M\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle M}\n  \n.

This shall induce a bias towards the order of the input sequence, so that, for example, the input sequence \"man bites dog\" is processed differently from \"dog bites man\".\nThe positional encoding is defined as a function of type \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        :\n        \n          R\n        \n        \u2192\n        \n          \n            R\n          \n          \n            d\n          \n        \n        ;\n        d\n        \u2208\n        \n          Z\n        \n        ,\n        d\n        >\n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f:\\mathbb {R} \\to \\mathbb {R} ^{d};d\\in \\mathbb {Z} ,d>0}\n  \n, where \n  \n    \n      \n        d\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle d}\n  \n is a positive even integer.

This allows the transformer to take any encoded position and find a linear sum of the encoded locations of its neighbors. This sum of encoded positions, when fed into the attention mechanism, would create attention weights on its neighbors, much like what happens in a convolutional neural network language model. In the author's words, \"we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by relative position.\"\nIn typical implementations, all operations are done over the real numbers, not the complex numbers, but since complex multiplication can be implemented as real 2-by-2 matrix multiplication, this is a mere notational difference.\nEncoder-decoder (overview)\nLike earlier seq2seq models, the original transformer model used an encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder consists of encoding layers that process all the input tokens together one layer after another, while the decoder consists of decoding layers that iteratively process the encoder's output and the decoder's output tokens so far.\nThe purpose of each encoder layer is to create contextualized representations of the tokens, where each representation corresponds to a token that \"mixes\" information from other input tokens via self-attention mechanism. Each decoder layer contains two attention sublayers: (1) cross-attention for incorporating the output of encoder (contextualized input token representations), and (2) self-attention for \"mixing\" information among the input tokens to the decoder (i.e. the tokens generated so far during inference time).\nBoth the encoder and decoder layers have a feed-forward neural network for additional processing of their outputs and contain residual connections and layer normalization steps. These feed-forward layers contain most of the parameters in a Transformer model.\nFeedforward network\nThe feedforward network (FFN) modules in a Transformer are 2-layered multilayer perceptrons:\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          F\n          F\n          N\n        \n        (\n        x\n        )\n        =\n        \u03d5\n        (\n        x\n        \n          W\n          \n            (\n            1\n            )\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          b\n          \n            (\n            1\n            )\n          \n        \n        )\n        \n          W\n          \n            (\n            2\n            )\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          b\n          \n            (\n            2\n            )\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {FFN} (x)=\\phi (xW^{(1)}+b^{(1)})W^{(2)}+b^{(2)}}\n  \nwhere \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          W\n          \n            (\n            1\n            )\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle W^{(1)}}\n  \n and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          W\n          \n            (\n            2\n            )\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle W^{(2)}}\n  \n are weight matrices and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          b\n          \n            (\n            1\n            )\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle b^{(1)}}\n  \n and  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          b\n          \n            (\n            2\n            )\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle b^{(2)}}\n  \n are bias vectors, and \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03d5\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\phi }\n  \n is its activation function.

It is theoretically possible for all three to be different, but that is rarely the case in practice.\nMultiheaded attention\nOne set of \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          (\n          \n            \n              W\n              \n                Q\n              \n            \n            ,\n            \n              W\n              \n                K\n              \n            \n            ,\n            \n              W\n              \n                V\n              \n            \n          \n          )\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\left(W^{Q},W^{K},W^{V}\\right)}\n  \n matrices is called an attention head, and each layer in a transformer model has multiple attention heads. While each attention head attends to the tokens that are relevant to each token, multiple attention heads allow the model to do this for different definitions of \"relevance\". Specifically, the query and key projection matrices, \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          W\n          \n            Q\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle W^{Q}}\n  \n and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          W\n          \n            K\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle W^{K}}\n  \n , which are involved in the attention score computation, defines the \"relevance\". Meanwhile, the value projection matrix \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          W\n          \n            V\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle W^{V}}\n  \n, in combination with the part of the output projection matrix \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          W\n          \n            O\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle W^{O}}\n  \n, determines how the attended tokens influence what information is passed to subsequent layers and ultimately the output logits. In addition, the scope of attention, or the range of token relationships captured by each attention head, can expand as tokens pass through successive layers. This allows the model to capture more complex and long-range dependencies in deeper layers. Many transformer attention heads encode relevance relations that are meaningful to humans. For example, some attention heads can attend mostly to the next word, while others mainly attend from verbs to their direct objects. The computations for each attention head can be performed in parallel, which allows for fast processing. The outputs for the attention layer are concatenated to pass into the feed-forward neural network layers.\nConcretely, let the multiple attention heads be indexed by \n  \n    \n      \n        i\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i}\n  \n, then we have\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          MultiheadedAttention\n        \n        (\n        Q\n        ,\n        K\n        ,\n        V\n        )\n        =\n        \n          \n            Concat\n          \n          \n            i\n            \u2208\n            [\n            \n              n\n              \n                heads\n              \n            \n            ]\n          \n        \n        (\n        \n          Attention\n        \n        (\n        Q\n        \n          W\n          \n            i\n          \n          \n            Q\n          \n        \n        ,\n        K\n        \n          W\n          \n            i\n          \n          \n            K\n          \n        \n        ,\n        V\n        \n          W\n          \n            i\n          \n          \n            V\n          \n        \n        )\n        )\n        \n          W\n          \n            O\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\text{MultiheadedAttention}}(Q,K,V)={\\text{Concat}}_{i\\in [n_{\\text{heads}}]}({\\text{Attention}}(QW_{i}^{Q},KW_{i}^{K},VW_{i}^{V}))W^{O}}\n  \n where the matrix \n  \n    \n      \n        X\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle X}\n  \n is the concatenation of word embeddings, and the matrices \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          W\n          \n            i\n          \n          \n            Q\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          W\n          \n            i\n          \n          \n            K\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          W\n          \n            i\n          \n          \n            V\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle W_{i}^{Q},W_{i}^{K},W_{i}^{V}}\n  \n are \"projection matrices\" owned by individual attention head \n  \n    \n      \n        i\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i}\n  \n, and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          W\n          \n            O\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle W^{O}}\n  \n is a final projection matrix owned by the whole multi-headed attention head.\nIt is theoretically possible for each attention head to have a different head dimension \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          d\n          \n            head\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle d_{\\text{head}}}\n  \n, but that is rarely the case in practice.\nAs an example, in the smallest GPT-2 model, there are only self-attention mechanisms.

The first encoder layer takes the sequence of input vectors from the embedding layer, producing a sequence of vectors. This sequence of vectors is processed by the second encoder, and so on. The output from the final encoder layer is then used by the decoder.\nAs the encoder processes the entire input all at once, every token can attend to every other token (all-to-all attention), so there is no need for causal masking.\nDecoder\nA decoder consists of an embedding layer, followed by multiple decoder layers, followed by an un-embedding layer.\nEach decoder consists of three major components: a causally masked self-attention mechanism, a cross-attention mechanism, and a feed-forward neural network. The decoder functions in a similar fashion to the encoder, but an additional attention mechanism is inserted which instead draws relevant information from the encodings generated by the encoders. This mechanism can also be called the encoder-decoder attention.\nLike the first encoder, the first decoder takes positional information and embeddings of the output sequence as its input, rather than encodings. The transformer must not use the current or future output to predict an output, so the output sequence must be partially masked to prevent this reverse information flow. This allows for autoregressive text generation. For decoding, all-to-all attention is inappropriate, because a token cannot attend to tokens not yet generated. Thus, the self-attention module in the decoder is causally masked.\nIn contrast, the cross-attention mechanism attends to the output vectors of the encoder, which is computed before the decoder starts decoding. Consequently, there is no need for masking in the cross-attention mechanism.\nSchematically, we have:\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                \n                  H\n                  \u2032\n                \n              \n              \n                \n                =\n                \n                  MaskedMultiheadedAttention\n                \n                (\n                H\n                ,\n                H\n                ,\n                H\n                )\n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  DecoderLayer\n                \n                (\n                H\n                )\n              \n              \n                \n                =\n                \n                  FFN\n                \n                (\n                \n                  MultiheadedAttention\n                \n                (\n                \n                  H\n                  \u2032\n                \n                ,\n                \n                  H\n                  \n                    E\n                  \n                \n                ,\n                \n                  H\n                  \n                    E\n                  \n                \n                )\n                )\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\begin{aligned}H'&={\\text{MaskedMultiheadedAttention}}(H,H,H)\\\\{\\text{DecoderLayer}}(H)&={\\text{FFN}}({\\text{MultiheadedAttention}}(H',H^{E},H^{E}))\\end{aligned}}}\n  \nwhere \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          H\n          \n            E\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle H^{E}}\n  \n is the matrix with rows being the output vectors from the encoder.\nThe last decoder is followed by a final un-embedding layer. to produce the output probabilities over the vocabulary. Then, one of the tokens is sampled according to the probability, and the decoder can be run again to produce the next token, etc, autoregressively generating output text.\nAdapted architectures\nMany large language models, since they do not need to predict a whole new sequence from an input sequence, only use the encoder or decoder of the original transformer architecture. Early GPT models are decoder-only models trained to predict the next token in a sequence. BERT, another language model, only makes use of an encoder, and is trained to predict a randomly masked token in a sequence.\nFull transformer architecture\n\nSublayers\nEach encoder layer contains 2 sublayers: the self-attention and the feedforward network. Each decoder layer contains 3 sublayers: the causally masked self-attention, the cross-attention, and the feedforward network.\n\nThe final points of detail are the residual connections and layer normalization (LayerNorm, or LN), which while conceptually unnecessary, are necessary for numerical stability and convergence.  \nThe residual connection, which is introduced to avoid vanishing gradient issues and stabilize the training process, can be expressed as follows: y = F(x) + x. The expression indicates that an output y is the sum of the transformation of input x (F(x)) and the input itself (x). Adding the input x can preserve the input information and avoid issues when the gradient of F(x) is close to zero.  \nSimilarly to how the feedforward network modules are applied individually to each vector, the LayerNorm is also applied individually to each vector. \nThere are two common conventions in use: the post-LN and the pre-LN convention.

The pre-LN convention, proposed several times in 2018, was found to be easier to train, requiring no warm-up, leading to faster convergence.\nPseudocode\nThe following is the pseudocode for a standard pre-LN encoder-decoder Transformer, adapted from\n\ninput: Encoder input t_e\n       Decoder input t_d\noutput: Array of probability distributions, with shape (decoder vocabulary size x length(decoder output sequence))\n\n/* encoder */\nz_e \u2190 encoder.tokenizer(t_e)\n\nfor each t in 1:length(z_e) do\n    z_e[t] \u2190 encoder.embedding(z_e[t]) + encoder.positional_embedding(t)\n\nfor each l in 1:length(encoder.layers) do\n    layer \u2190 encoder.layers[l]\n\n    /* first sublayer */\n    z_e_copy \u2190 copy(z_e)\n    for each t in 1:length(z_e) do\n        z_e[t] \u2190 layer.layer_norm(z_e[t])\n    z_e \u2190 layer.multiheaded_attention(z_e, z_e, z_e)\n    for each t in 1:length(z_e) do\n        z_e[t] \u2190 z_e[t] + z_e_copy[t]\n\n    /* second sublayer */\n    z_e_copy \u2190 copy(z_e)\n    for each t in 1:length(z_e) do\n        z_e[t] \u2190 layer.layer_norm(z_e[t])\n    z_e \u2190 layer.feedforward(z_e)\n    for each t in 1:length(z_e) do\n        z_e[t] \u2190 z_e[t] + z_e_copy[t]\n\nfor each t in 1:length(z_e) do\n    z_e[t] \u2190 encoder.final_layer_norm(z_e[t])\n\n/* decoder */\nz_d \u2190 decoder.tokenizer(t_d)\n\nfor each t in 1:length(z_d) do\n    z_d[t] \u2190 decoder.embedding(z_d[t]) + decoder.positional_embedding(t)\n\nfor each l in 1:length(decoder.layers) do\n        layer \u2190 decoder.layers[l]\n\n        /* first sublayer */\n        z_d_copy \u2190 copy(z_d)\n        for each t in 1:length(z_d) do\n            z_d[t] \u2190 layer.layer_norm(z_d[t])\n        z_d \u2190 layer.masked_multiheaded_attention(z_d, z_d, z_d)\n        for each t in 1:length(z_d) do\n            z_d[t] \u2190 z_d[t] + z_d_copy[t]\n\n        /* second sublayer */\n        z_d_copy \u2190 copy(z_d)\n        for each t in 1:length(z_d) do\n            z_d[t] \u2190 layer.layer_norm(z_d[t])\n        z_d \u2190 layer.multiheaded_attention(z_d, z_e, z_e) \n        for each i in 1:length(z_d) do\n            z_d[t] \u2190 z_d[t] + z_d_copy[t]\n\n        /* third sublayer */\n        z_d_copy \u2190 copy(z_d)\n        for each t in 1:length(z_d) do\n            z_d[t] \u2190 layer.layer_norm(z_d[t])\n        z_d \u2190 layer.feedforward(z_d)\n        for each t in 1:length(z_d) do\n            z_d[t] \u2190 z_d[t] + z_d_copy[t]\n\nz_d \u2190 decoder.final_layer_norm(z_d)\n\noutput_distributions \u2190 []\nfor each t in 1:length(z_d) do\n    output_distributions.append(decoder.unembed(z_d[t]))\n\nreturn output_distributions\nTerminology\nThe Transformer architecture, being modular, allows variations. Several common variations are described here.\nAn \"encoder-only\" Transformer applies the encoder to map an input text into a sequence of vectors that represent the input text. This is usually used for text embedding and representation learning for downstream applications. BERT is encoder-only. They are less often used currently, as they were found to be not significantly better than training an encoder-decoder Transformer, then taking just the encoder.\nA \"decoder-only\" Transformer is not literally decoder-only, since without an encoder, the cross-attention mechanism has nothing to attend to. Thus, the decoder layers in a decoder-only Transformer is composed of just two sublayers: the causally masked self-attention, and the feedforward network. This is usually used for text generation and instruction following. The models in the GPT series and Chinchilla series are decoder-only.\nAn \"encoder-decoder\" Transformer is generally the same as the original Transformer, with 2 sublayers per encoder layer and 3 sublayers per decoder layer, etc. They might have minor architectural improvements, such as alternative activation functions, changing the location of normalization, etc. This is also usually used for text generation and instruction following. The models in the T5 series are encoder-decoder.\nA \"prefixLM\" (prefix language model) is a decoder-only architecture, but with prefix masking, which is different from causal masking. Specifically, it has mask of the form:\u200aFigure 3\u200a\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          M\n          \n            prefixLM\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            [\n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    0\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \u2212\n                  \u221e\n                \n              \n              \n                \n                  \n                    0\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    M\n                    \n                      causal\n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n            ]\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle M_{\\text{prefixLM}}={\\begin{bmatrix}\\mathbf {0} &-\\infty \\\\\\mathbf {0} &M_{\\text{causal}}\\end{bmatrix}}}\n  \nwhere the first columns correspond to the \"prefix\", and the subsequent columns correspond to the autoregressively generated text based on the prefix. They resemble encoder-decoder models, but has less \"sparsity\". Such models are rarely used, though they are cited as theoretical possibilities and benchmarked comparisons.\nThere are also mixed seq2seq models. For example, in 2020, Google Translate replaced the previous RNN-encoder\u2013RNN-decoder model by a Transformer-encoder\u2013RNN-decoder model, on the argument that an RNN-decoder runs much faster than Transformer-decoder when run autoregressively.\nSubsequent work\n\nAlternative activation functions\nThe original transformer uses ReLU activation function. Other activation functions were developed. The Llama series and PaLM used SwiGLU; both GPT-1 and BERT used GELU. \nAlternative activation functions are often used in combination with Gated Linear Units in the feedforward module.\nAlternative normalizations\nThe normalization used in the Transformer can be different from LayerNorm. One example is RMSNorm which is used in the Llama series. Other examples include CapsuleNorm ScaleNorm, or FixNorm.\nAlternative positional encodings\nTransformers may use other positional encoding methods than sinusoidal. \nThe original Transformer paper reported using a learned positional encoding, but finding it not superior to the sinusoidal one. Later,  found that causal masking itself provides enough signal to a Transformer decoder that it can learn to implicitly perform absolute positional encoding without the positional encoding module.\nRoPE\nRoPE (rotary positional embedding), is best explained by considering a list of 2-dimensional vectors \n  \n    \n      \n        [\n        (\n        \n          x\n          \n            1\n          \n          \n            (\n            1\n            )\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          x\n          \n            1\n          \n          \n            (\n            2\n            )\n          \n        \n        )\n        ,\n        (\n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n          \n            (\n            1\n            )\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n          \n            (\n            2\n            )\n          \n        \n        )\n        ,\n        (\n        \n          x\n          \n            3\n          \n          \n            (\n            1\n            )\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          x\n          \n            3\n          \n          \n            (\n            2\n            )\n          \n        \n        )\n        ,\n        .\n        .\n        .\n        ]\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle [(x_{1}^{(1)},x_{1}^{(2)}),(x_{2}^{(1)},x_{2}^{(2)}),(x_{3}^{(1)},x_{3}^{(2)}),...]}\n  \n.

Since it is directly plugged into the attention mechanism, it can be combined with any positional encoder that is plugged into the \"bottom\" of the entire network (which is where the sinusoidal encoder on the original transformer, as well as RoPE and many others, are located).\nRelative Position Encodings\nRelative Position Encodings is similar to ALiBi, but more generic:\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                \n                  Attention\n                \n                (\n                Q\n                ,\n                K\n                ,\n                V\n                )\n                =\n                \n                  softmax\n                \n                \n                  (\n                  \n                    \n                      \n                        \n                          Q\n                          \n                            K\n                            \n                              \n                                T\n                              \n                            \n                          \n                        \n                        \n                          \n                            d\n                            \n                              k\n                            \n                          \n                        \n                      \n                    \n                    +\n                    B\n                  \n                  )\n                \n                V\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\begin{aligned}{\\text{Attention}}(Q,K,V)={\\text{softmax}}\\left({\\frac {QK^{\\mathrm {T} }}{\\sqrt {d_{k}}}}+B\\right)V\\end{aligned}}}\n  \nwhere \n  \n    \n      \n        B\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle B}\n  \n is a Toeplitz matrix, that is, \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          B\n          \n            i\n            ,\n            j\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          B\n          \n            \n              i\n              \u2032\n            \n            ,\n            \n              j\n              \u2032\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle B_{i,j}=B_{i',j'}}\n  \n whenever \n  \n    \n      \n        i\n        \u2212\n        j\n        =\n        \n          i\n          \u2032\n        \n        \u2212\n        \n          j\n          \u2032\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i-j=i'-j'}\n  \n. This is contrasted with the original sinusoidal positional encoding, which is an \"absolute positional encoding\".\nEfficient implementation\nThe transformer model has been implemented in standard deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch. Transformers is a library produced by Hugging Face that supplies transformer-based architectures and pretrained models.\nKV caching\nWhen an autoregressive transformer is used for inference, such as generating text, the query vector is different at each step, but the already-computed key and value vectors are always the same. The KV caching method saves the computed key and value vectors at each attention block, so that they are not recomputed at each new token. PagedAttention applies memory paging to KV caching.\nIf a transformer is used with a baked-in prompt, such as [\"You are a customer support agent...\"], then the key and value vectors can be computed for the prompt, and saved on disk. The saving in compute is significant when the model is used for many short interactions, such as in online chatbots.\nFlashAttention\nFlashAttention is an algorithm that implements the transformer attention mechanism efficiently on a GPU. It is a communication-avoiding algorithm that performs matrix multiplications in blocks, such that each block fits within the cache of a GPU, and by careful management of the blocks it minimizes data copying between GPU caches (as data movement is slow). See the page on softmax for details.\nAn improved version, FlashAttention-2, was developed to cater to the rising demand for language models capable of handling longer context lengths. It offers enhancements in work partitioning and parallelism, enabling it to achieve up to 230 TFLOPs/s on A100 GPUs (FP16/BF16), a 2x speed increase over the original FlashAttention.\nKey advancements in FlashAttention-2 include the reduction of non-matmul FLOPs, improved parallelism over the sequence length dimension, better work partitioning between GPU warps, and added support for head dimensions up to 256 and multi-query attention (MQA) and grouped-query attention (GQA).\nBenchmarks revealed FlashAttention-2 to be up to 2x faster than FlashAttention and up to 9x faster than a standard attention implementation in PyTorch. Future developments include optimization for new hardware like H100 GPUs and new data types like FP8.\nMulti-Query Attention\nMulti-Query Attention changes the multiheaded attention mechanism.

MQA is GQA with one group, while standard multiheaded attention is GQA with the maximal number of groups.\n\nMultihead Latent Attention (MLA) is a low-rank approximation to standard MHA. Specifically, each hidden vector, before entering the attention mechanism, is first projected to two low-dimensional spaces (\"latent space\"), one for query and one for key-value (KV vector). This design minimizes the KV cache, as only the low-dimensional KV vector needs to be cached.\nSpeculative decoding\nSpeculative decoding is a method to accelerate token decoding. Similarly to speculative execution in CPUs, future tokens are computed quickly, then verified. If the quickly computed tokens are incorrect, they are discarded and computed slowly.\nThe key factor in speculative decoding is that a Transformer decoder can verify faster than it can decode, in the following sense.\nSuppose we have two transformer models like GPT-3 and GPT-3-small, both with a context window size of 512. To generate an entire context window autoregressively with greedy decoding with GPT-3, it must be run for 512 times, each time generating a token \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          x\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        ,\n        .\n        .\n        .\n        ,\n        \n          x\n          \n            512\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{512}}\n  \n, taking time \n  \n    \n      \n        512\n        \n          T\n          \n            GPT-3\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 512T_{\\text{GPT-3}}}\n  \n. However, if we had some educated guess for the values of these tokens, we could verify all of them in parallel, in one run of the model, by checking that each \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          x\n          \n            t\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x_{t}}\n  \n is indeed the token with the largest log-likelihood in the \n  \n    \n      \n        t\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle t}\n  \n-th output.\nIn speculative decoding, a smaller model or some other simple heuristic is used to generate a few speculative tokens that are subsequently verified by the larger model. For example, suppose we use GPT-3-small to generate four speculative tokens: \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                x\n                ~\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          \n            \n              \n                x\n                ~\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          \n            \n              \n                x\n                ~\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            3\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          \n            \n              \n                x\n                ~\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            4\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\tilde {x}}_{1},{\\tilde {x}}_{2},{\\tilde {x}}_{3},{\\tilde {x}}_{4}}\n  \n.

However, that vector can then be further processed by another Transformer block to predict the next token, and so on for arbitrarily many steps into the future. This trades off accuracy for speed, since each new token costs just one more Transformer block, rather than the entire stack.\nSub-quadratic transformers\nTraining transformer-based architectures can be expensive, especially for long inputs. Many methods have been developed to attempt to address the issue. In the image domain, Swin Transformer is an efficient architecture that performs attention inside shifting windows. In the audio domain, SepTr decouples the attention in time and frequency domains. Long Range Arena (2020) is a standard benchmark for comparing the behavior of transformer architectures over long inputs.\nAlternative attention graphs\nThe standard attention graph is either all-to-all or causal, both of which scales as \n  \n    \n      \n        O\n        (\n        \n          N\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle O(N^{2})}\n  \n where \n  \n    \n      \n        N\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle N}\n  \n is the number of tokens in a sequence.\nReformer (2020) reduces the computational load from \n  \n    \n      \n        O\n        (\n        \n          N\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle O(N^{2})}\n  \n to \n  \n    \n      \n        O\n        (\n        N\n        ln\n        \u2061\n        N\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle O(N\\ln N)}\n  \n by using locality-sensitive hashing and reversible layers. \nSparse attention uses attention graphs that grows slower than \n  \n    \n      \n        O\n        (\n        \n          N\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle O(N^{2})}\n  \n. For example, BigBird (2020) uses random small-world networks which grows as \n  \n    \n      \n        O\n        (\n        N\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle O(N)}\n  \n.\nOrdinary transformers require a memory size that is quadratic in the size of the context window. Attention-free transformers reduce this to a linear dependence while still retaining the advantages of a transformer by linking the key to the value.\nRandom Feature Attention\nRandom Feature Attention (2021) uses Fourier random features:\n  \n    \n      \n        \u03c6\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        =\n        \n          \n            1\n            \n              D\n            \n          \n        \n        [\n        cos\n        \u2061\n        \u27e8\n        \n          w\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        x\n        \u27e9\n        ,\n        sin\n        \u2061\n        \u27e8\n        \n          w\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        x\n        \u27e9\n        ,\n        \u22ef\n        cos\n        \u2061\n        \u27e8\n        \n          w\n          \n            D\n          \n        \n        ,\n        x\n        \u27e9\n        ,\n        sin\n        \u2061\n        \u27e8\n        \n          w\n          \n            D\n          \n        \n        ,\n        x\n        \u27e9\n        \n          ]\n          \n            T\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\varphi (x)={\\frac {1}{\\sqrt {D}}}[\\cos \\langle w_{1},x\\rangle ,\\sin \\langle w_{1},x\\rangle ,\\cdots \\cos \\langle w_{D},x\\rangle ,\\sin \\langle w_{D},x\\rangle ]^{T}}\n  \nwhere \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          w\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        .\n        .\n        .\n        ,\n        \n          w\n          \n            D\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle w_{1},...,w_{D}}\n  \n are independent samples from the normal distribution \n  \n    \n      \n        N\n        (\n        0\n        ,\n        \n          \u03c3\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        I\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle N(0,\\sigma ^{2}I)}\n  \n.

A 2022 study found that Transformers pretrained only on natural language can be finetuned on only 0.03% of parameters and become competitive with LSTMs on a variety of logical and visual tasks, demonstrating transfer learning. The LLaVA was a vision-language model composed of a language model (Vicuna-13B) and a vision model (ViT-L/14), connected by a linear layer. Only the linear layer is finetuned.\nVision transformers adapt the transformer to computer vision by breaking down input images as a series of patches, turning them into vectors, and treating them like tokens in a standard transformer.\nConformer and later Whisper follow the same pattern for speech recognition, first turning the speech signal into a spectrogram, which is then treated like an image, i.e. broken down into a series of patches, turned into vectors and treated like tokens in a standard transformer.\nPerceivers are a variant of Transformers designed for multimodality.\nFor image generation, notable architectures are DALL-E 1 (2021), Parti (2022), Phenaki (2023), and Muse (2023). Unlike later models, DALL-E is not a diffusion model. Instead, it uses a decoder-only Transformer that autoregressively generates a text, followed by the token representation of an image, which is then converted by a variational autoencoder to an image. Parti is an encoder-decoder Transformer, where the encoder processes a text prompt, and the decoder generates a token representation of an image. Muse is an encoder-only Transformer that is trained to predict masked image tokens from unmasked image tokens. During generation, all input tokens are masked, and the highest-confidence predictions are included for the next iteration, until all tokens are predicted. Phenaki is a text-to-video model. It is a bidirectional masked transformer conditioned on pre-computed text tokens. The generated tokens are then decoded to a video.\nApplications\nThe transformer has had great success in natural language processing (NLP). Many large language models such as GPT-2, GPT-3, GPT-4, Gemini, AlbertAGPT, Claude, BERT, Grok, XLNet, RoBERTa and ChatGPT demonstrate the ability of transformers to perform a wide variety of NLP-related subtasks and their related real-world applications, including:\n\nmachine translation\ntime series prediction\ndocument summarization\ndocument generation\nnamed entity recognition (NER)\nwriting computer code based on requirements expressed in natural language.\nspeech-to-text\nBeyond traditional NLP, the transformer architecture has had success in other applications, such as:\n\nbiological sequence analysis\nvideo understanding\nprotein folding (such as AlphaFold)\nevaluating chess board positions. Using static evaluation alone (that is, with no Minimax search) transformer achieved an Elo of 2895, putting it at grandmaster level.\nSee also\nseq2seq \u2013 Family of machine learning approaches\nPerceiver \u2013 Variant of Transformer designed for multimodal data\nVision transformer \u2013 Machine learning model for vision processing\nLarge language model \u2013 Type of machine learning model\nBERT (language model) \u2013 Series of language models developed by Google AI\nGenerative pre-trained transformer \u2013 Type of large language model\nT5 (language model) \u2013 Series of large language models developed by Google AI\nNotes\n\nReferences\n== Further reading ==", "result": "# Transformer (deep learning architecture)\n\nThe Transformer is a deep learning architecture introduced in 2017 by Google researchers. It was designed to process sequential data without relying on recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which are known for their long training times due to vanishing gradients. The Transformer uses self-attention mechanisms to weigh the importance of different words or tokens within a sequence, enabling it to capture dependencies between distant elements more effectively than traditional RNNs.\n\n## History\n\nThe Transformer was developed in 2017 by Google researchers, who were looking for ways to improve the performance of neural machine translation systems. They found that recurrent neural networks (RNNs) were slow to train and prone to vanishing gradients, making them difficult to use for long sequences. To address this problem, they introduced the Transformer architecture, which uses self-attention mechanisms to weigh the importance of different words or tokens within a sequence.\n\nThe Transformer quickly gained popularity in the field of natural language processing (NLP), as it was able to achieve state-of-the-art results on a range of tasks, including machine translation, text classification, and question answering. Since its introduction, the Transformer has been adapted and extended to work with other types of data, such as images and audio, and has become one of the most widely used deep learning architectures in the world.\n\n## Architecture\n\nThe Transformer architecture consists of two main components: the encoder and the decoder. The encoder processes the input sequence and produces a set of hidden representations, while the decoder generates the output sequence based on these representations.\n\nAt the core of the Transformer is the self-attention mechanism, which allows the model to weigh the importance of different words or tokens within a sequence. This mechanism enables the Transformer to capture dependencies between distant elements in the sequence, which is particularly useful for tasks such as machine translation, where the meaning of a word can depend on the context in which it appears.\n\nIn addition to self-attention, the Transformer also uses multi-head attention, which allows the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence simultaneously. This helps the Transformer to capture a wider range of dependencies and improve its ability to handle complex tasks.\n\nThe Transformer architecture also includes feed-forward neural networks, which are used to process the hidden representations produced by the self-attention mechanism. These networks are composed of multiple linear layers followed by activation functions, which help the model to learn complex patterns in the data.\n\nOverall, the Transformer architecture is highly parallelizable, which makes it well-suited for processing large amounts of data. This has made it particularly popular in applications such as machine translation, where the model must process entire sentences at once, rather than one word at a time.\n\n## Applications\n\nThe Transformer architecture has been applied to a wide range of tasks in natural language processing (NLP). Some of the most common applications include:\n\n* Machine translation: The Transformer has achieved state-of-the-art results on a range of machine translation benchmarks, including the WMT'14 English-German and WMT'16 English-French translation tasks.\n* Text classification: The Transformer has been used to classify text into different categories, such as sentiment analysis and topic classification.\n* Question answering: The Transformer has been used to answer questions about a given piece of text, such as in the SQuAD question-answering task.\n* Language modeling: The Transformer has been used to predict the next word in a sentence, which is useful for tasks such as text generation and speech recognition.\n\nIn addition to NLP, the Transformer has also been applied to other domains, such as computer vision and speech recognition. For example, the Vision Transformer (ViT) has been used to achieve state-of-the-art results on image classification tasks, while the Speech Transformer has been used to improve speech recognition accuracy.\n\n## Advancements\n\nSince its introduction, the Transformer architecture has undergone several advancements and adaptations. One of the most significant changes has been the introduction of the causal Transformer, which adds a mask to the self-attention mechanism to prevent the model from attending to future tokens during training. This allows the Transformer to be used for tasks such as text generation and speech recognition, where the order of the tokens is important.\n\nAnother important advancement has been the development of pre-trained models, such as BERT and GPT, which are trained on large amounts of text data and can be fine-tuned for specific tasks. These models have achieved state-of-the-art results on a range of NLP tasks and have become widely used in industry and academia.\n\nIn recent years, there have also been several efforts to make the Transformer more efficient and scalable. For example, the XLNet model introduces a new self-attention mechanism called permutation-augmented attention, which allows the model to capture long-range dependencies in the input sequence. The T5 model introduces a new training objective called prefix tuning, which allows the model to be trained using a smaller number of parameters while maintaining high performance.\n\nDespite these advancements, the Transformer architecture still faces some challenges. For example, it can be difficult to train on very large datasets, and it can be sensitive to hyperparameter choices. Researchers continue to explore new techniques and architectures to address these challenges and further improve the performance of the Transformer.\n\n## Other applications\n\n### Image processing\n\nThe Transformer architecture has also been applied to image processing tasks, such as image classification and object detection. In these applications, the self-attention mechanism is used to capture relationships between pixels in the image, allowing the model to learn features that are invariant to spatial transformations.\n\nOne notable application of the Transformer in image processing is the Vision Transformer (ViT), which treats an image as a sequence of patches and applies the self-attention mechanism to each patch. This approach has achieved state-of-the-art results on several image classification benchmarks, including the ImageNet dataset.\n\nAnother application of the Transformer in image processing is the DeiT model, which uses a pre-trained ViT model to extract features from an image and then fine-tunes the model for a specific task, such as image classification or object detection.\n\nIn addition to these applications, the Transformer has also been used to improve the performance of generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), in image processing tasks.\n\n### Audio processing\n\nThe Transformer architecture has also been applied to audio processing tasks, such as speech recognition and music generation. In these applications, the self-attention mechanism is used to capture relationships between different parts of the audio signal, allowing the model to learn features that are invariant to temporal variations.\n\nOne notable application of the Transformer in audio processing is the Speech Transformer, which uses the self-attention mechanism to model the acoustic features of speech signals. This approach has achieved state-of-the-art results on several speech recognition benchmarks, including the LibriSpeech dataset.\n\nAnother application of the Transformer in audio processing is the Music Transformer, which uses the self-attention mechanism to model the temporal dependencies in musical sequences. This approach has achieved state-of-the-art results on several music generation benchmarks, including the MAESTRO dataset.\n\nIn addition to these applications, the Transformer has also been used to improve the performance of generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), in audio processing tasks.\n\n### Video processing\n\nThe Transformer architecture has also been applied to video processing tasks, such as action recognition and video captioning. In these applications, the self-attention mechanism is used to capture relationships between different parts of the video signal, allowing the model to learn features that are invariant to spatial and temporal variations.\n\nOne notable application of the Transformer in video processing is the Video Transformer, which uses the self-attention mechanism to model the spatio-temporal dependencies in video sequences. This approach has achieved state-of-the-art results on several action recognition benchmarks, including the Kinetics dataset.\n\nAnother application of the Transformer in video processing is the Video Captioning Transformer, which uses the self-attention mechanism to model the relationships between the video frames and the corresponding captions. This approach has achieved state-of-the-art results on several video captioning benchmarks, including the MSRVTT dataset.\n\nIn addition to these applications, the Transformer has also been used to improve the performance of generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), in video processing tasks.\n\n### Other modalities\n\nThe Transformer architecture has also been applied to other modalities, such as text, images, and audio, to enable cross-modal learning and transfer learning. Cross-modal learning involves training a single model to operate across multiple modalities, which can improve the model's generalization ability and reduce the amount of data required for training. Transfer learning involves using a pre-trained model on one modality as a starting point for training on another modality, which can speed up convergence and improve performance.\n\nOne notable application of the Transformer in cross-modal learning is the Multimodal Transformer, which uses the self-attention mechanism to model the relationships between different modalities. This approach has achieved state-of-the-art results on several cross-modal learning benchmarks, including the Flickr30k dataset.\n\nAnother application of the Transformer in transfer learning is the Multimodal Pre-trained Transformer, which uses a pre-trained model on one modality as a starting point for training on another modality. This approach has achieved state-of-the-art results on several transfer learning benchmarks, including the Visual Question Answering (VQA) task.\n\nIn addition to these applications, the Transformer has also been used to improve the performance of generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), in cross-modal learning and transfer learning tasks.\n\n## Future directions\n\nThe Transformer architecture has had a significant impact on the field of artificial intelligence, particularly in the area of natural language processing. However, there are still many open research questions and opportunities for future work in this area. Some of the key directions for future research include:\n\n* Improving the efficiency and scalability of the Transformer: The Transformer is computationally expensive and requires a large amount of memory, which limits its applicability to large-scale datasets. Researchers are exploring new techniques to reduce the computational cost and memory requirements of the Transformer, such as pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation.\n* Developing more robust and interpretable models: While the Transformer has achieved impressive results on a range of tasks, it is still difficult to understand how the model makes decisions and why it performs certain actions. Researchers are exploring new techniques to improve the robustness and interpretability of the Transformer, such as adversarial training, regularization, and attention visualization.\n* Expanding the range of applications: While the Transformer has been applied to a wide range of tasks, there are still many areas where it could be useful, such as robotics, healthcare, and finance. Researchers are exploring new applications of the Transformer in these domains and developing new models that are tailored to specific tasks.\n* Integrating the Transformer with other AI technologies: The Transformer is just one of many deep learning architectures, and researchers are exploring ways to integrate it with other technologies, such as reinforcement learning, federated learning, and explainable AI. By combining the strengths of different approaches, it may be possible to develop even more powerful and flexible AI systems.\n\n"}]
