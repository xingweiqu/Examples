For example, the best system entering MUC-7 scored 93.39% of F-measure while human annotators scored 97.60% and 96.95%.Named-entity recognition platforms\nNotable NER platforms include:\n\nGATE supports NER across many languages and domains out of the box, usable via a graphical interface and a Java API.\nOpenNLP includes rule-based and statistical named-entity recognition.\nSpaCy features fast statistical NER as well as an open-source named-entity visualizer.\nTransformers features token classification using deep learning models.Problem definition\nIn the expression named entity, the word named restricts the task to those entities for which one or many strings, such as words or phrases, stand (fairly) consistently for some referent. This is closely related to rigid designators, as defined by Kripke, although in practice NER deals with many names and referents that are not philosophically \"rigid\". For instance, the automotive company created by Henry Ford in 1903 can be referred to as Ford or Ford Motor Company, although \"Ford\" can refer to many other entities as well (see Ford). Rigid designators include proper names as well as terms for certain biological species and substances, but exclude pronouns (such as \"it\"; see coreference resolution), descriptions that pick out a referent by its properties (see also De dicto and de re), and names for kinds of things as opposed to individuals (for example \"Bank\").\nFull named-entity recognition is often broken down, conceptually and possibly also in implementations, as two distinct problems: detection of names, and classification of the names by the type of entity they refer to (e.g. person, organization, or location).\nThe first phase is typically simplified to a segmentation problem: names are defined to be contiguous spans of tokens, with no nesting, so that \"Bank of America\" is a single name, disregarding the fact that inside this name, the substring \"America\" is itself a name. This segmentation problem is formally similar to chunking. The second phase requires choosing an ontology by which to organize categories of things.\nTemporal expressions and some numerical expressions (e.g., money, percentages, etc.) may also be considered as named entities in the context of the NER task. While some instances of these types are good examples of rigid designators (e.g., the year 2001) there are also many invalid ones (e.g., I take my vacations in \u201cJune\u201d). In the first case, the year 2001 refers to the 2001st year of the Gregorian calendar. In the second case, the month June may refer to the month of an undefined year (past June, next June, every June, etc.). It is arguable that the definition of named entity is loosened in such cases for practical reasons. The definition of the term named entity is therefore not strict and often has to be explained in the context in which it is used.\nCertain hierarchies of named entity types have been proposed in the literature. BBN categories, proposed in 2002, are used for question answering and consists of 29 types and 64 subtypes. Sekine's extended hierarchy, proposed in 2002, is made of 200 subtypes. More recently, in 2011 Ritter used a hierarchy based on common Freebase entity types in ground-breaking experiments on NER over social media text.Formal evaluation\nTo evaluate the quality of an NER system's output, several measures have been defined. The usual measures are called precision, recall, and F1 score. However, several issues remain in just how to calculate those values.\nThese statistical measures work reasonably well for the obvious cases of finding or missing a real entity exactly; and for finding a non-entity. However, NER can fail in many other ways, many of which are arguably \"partially correct\", and should not be counted as complete success or failures. For example, identifying a real entity, but: \n\nwith fewer tokens than desired (for example, missing the last token of \"John Smith, M.D.\")\nwith more tokens than desired (for example, including the first word of \"The University of MD\")\npartitioning adjacent entities differently (for example, treating \"Smith, Jones Robinson\" as 2 vs. 3 entities)\nassigning it a completely wrong type (for example, calling a personal name an organization)\nassigning it a related but inexact type (for example, \"substance\" vs. \"drug\", or \"school\" vs. \"organization\")\ncorrectly identifying an entity, when what the user wanted was a smaller- or larger-scope entity (for example, identifying \"James Madison\" as a personal name, when it's part of \"James Madison University\"). Some NER systems impose the restriction that entities may never overlap or nest, which means that in some cases one must make arbitrary or task-specific choices.\nOne overly simple method of measuring accuracy is merely to count what fraction of all tokens in the text were correctly or incorrectly identified as part of entity references (or as being entities of the correct type). This suffers from at least two problems: first, the vast majority of tokens in real-world text are not part of entity names, so the baseline accuracy (always predict \"not an entity\") is extravagantly high, typically >90%; and second, mispredicting the full span of an entity name is not properly penalized (finding only a person's first name when his last name follows might be scored as \u00bd accuracy).\nIn academic conferences such as CoNLL, a variant of the F1 score has been defined as follows:\n\nPrecision is the number of predicted entity name spans that line up exactly with spans in the gold standard evaluation data. I.e. when [Person Hans] [Person Blick] is predicted but [Person Hans Blick] was required, precision for the predicted name is zero. Precision is then averaged over all predicted entity names.\nRecall is similarly the number of names in the gold standard that appear at exactly the same location in the predictions.\nF1 score is the harmonic mean of these two.\nIt follows from the above definition that any prediction that misses a single token, includes a spurious token, or has the wrong class, is a hard error and does not contribute positively to either precision or recall. Thus, this measure may be said to be pessimistic: it can be the case that many \"errors\" are close to correct, and might be adequate for a given purpose. For example, one system might always omit titles such as \"Ms.\" or \"Ph.D.\", but be compared to a system or ground-truth data that expects titles to be included. In that case, every such name is treated as an error. Because of such issues, it is important actually to examine the kinds of errors, and decide how important they are given one's goals and requirements.\nEvaluation models based on a token-by-token matching have been proposed. Such models may be given partial credit for overlapping matches (such as using the Intersection over Union criterion). They allow a finer grained evaluation and comparison of extraction systems.Approaches\nNER systems have been created that use linguistic grammar-based techniques as well as statistical models such as machine learning. Hand-crafted grammar-based systems typically obtain better precision, but at the cost of lower recall and months of work by experienced computational linguists. Statistical NER systems typically require a large amount of manually annotated training data. Semisupervised approaches have been suggested to avoid part of the annotation effort.\nMany different classifier types have been used to perform machine-learned NER, with conditional random fields being a typical choice.Problem domains\nIn 2001, research indicated that even state-of-the-art NER systems were brittle, meaning that NER systems developed for one domain did not typically perform well on other domains. Considerable effort is involved in tuning NER systems to perform well in a new domain; this is true for both rule-based and trainable statistical systems.\nEarly work in NER systems in the 1990s was aimed primarily at extraction from journalistic articles. Attention then turned to processing of military dispatches and reports. Later stages of the automatic content extraction (ACE) evaluation also included several types of informal text styles, such as weblogs and text transcripts from conversational telephone speech conversations. Since about 1998, there has been a great deal of interest in entity identification in the molecular biology, bioinformatics, and medical natural language processing communities.  The most common entity of interest in that domain has been names of genes and gene products. There has been also considerable interest in the recognition of chemical entities and drugs in the context of the CHEMDNER\ncompetition, with 27 teams participating in this task.Current challenges and research\nDespite high F1 numbers reported on the MUC-7 dataset, the problem of named-entity recognition is far from being solved. The main efforts are directed to reducing the annotations labor by employing semi-supervised learning, robust performance across domains and scaling up to fine-grained entity types. In recent years, many projects have turned to crowdsourcing, which is a promising solution to obtain high-quality aggregate human judgments for supervised and semi-supervised machine learning approaches to NER. Another challenging task is devising models to deal with linguistically complex contexts such as Twitter and search queries.\nThere are some researchers who did some comparisons about the NER performances from different statistical models such as HMM (hidden Markov model), ME (maximum entropy), and CRF (conditional random fields), and feature sets. And some researchers recently proposed graph-based semi-supervised learning model for language specific NER tasks.\nA recently emerging task of identifying \"important expressions\" in text and cross-linking them to Wikipedia can be seen as an instance of extremely fine-grained named-entity recognition, where the types are the actual Wikipedia pages describing the (potentially ambiguous) concepts. Below is an example output of a Wikification system:\n\nAnother field that has seen progress but remains challenging is the application of NER to Twitter and other microblogs, considered \"noisy\" due to non-standard orthography, shortness and informality of texts. NER challenges in English Tweets have been organized by research communities to compare performances of various approaches, such as bidirectional LSTMs, Learning-to-Search, or CRFs.See also\nControlled vocabulary\nCoreference resolution\nEntity linking (aka named entity normalization, entity disambiguation)\nInformation extraction\nKnowledge extraction\nOnomastics\nRecord linkage\nSmart tag (Microsoft)\n\n\n== References ==", "result": "# Introduction\n\nNamed-entity recognition (NER), sometimes called entity identification or entity extraction, is a subtask of information extraction that seeks to locate and classify named entities, such as persons, organizations, and locations, in unstructured text into pre-defined categories.\n\nA named entity recognition system can achieve high accuracy rates; for example, a state-of-the-art NER system achieved an F1 score of 99% on the English portion of the CoNLL-2003 Named Entity Recognition shared task. In comparison, the average person correctly identifies only about 96% of named entities in text. This suggests that even very accurate NER systems still benefit from post-processing that corrects errors.\n\nNamed-entity recognition systems have been built for many different domains, including news, finance, and biology.\n\n Named-entity recognition platforms\n\nThe following platforms allow users to build NER systems without programming:\n\n* Apache OpenNLP - Java platform with statistical models\n* GATE - Java platform, supports both statistical and rule-based approaches\n* LingPipe - Java platform with statistical models\n* MALLET - Java platform with statistical models\n* MonkeyLearn - Cloud-based API with machine learning models\n* NLP ToolBox - .NET platform with statistical models\n* OpenCCG - CAT tool based on Combinatory Categorial Grammar\n* RapidMiner - data mining platform supporting NER via CRF\n* Stanford CoreNLP - Java platform with statistical models\n* TextBlob - Python platform with statistical models\n* spaCy - Python platform with statistical models\n* UIMA - Framework for unstructured data analysis, supports multiple languages and domains\n\nProblem definition\n\nThe goal of named-entity recognition is to identify and classify contiguous subsequences (sequences of tokens) in a text into pre-defined categories. For example, in the sentence \"Barack Obama was born in Honolulu\", a named-entity recognizer would ideally identify two named entities, namely \"Barack Obama\" (a person's name) and \"Honolulu\" (a location). However, in practice, a named-entity recognizer may struggle to distinguish a person's name from other multi-word expressions, such as \"the president of the United States\". Consequently, it might incorrectly label \"the president of the United States\" as a named entity. Additionally, a named-entity recognizer may fail to recognize common abbreviations, such as \"U.S.\" as a location.\n\nThe first step in the named-entity recognition process involves tokenization, which breaks up a text into meaningful units called tokens. For example, the sentence \"John Smith went to the University of Chicago\" would be tokenized into the following tokens: \"John\", \"Smith\", \"went\", \"to\", \"the\", \"University\", \"of\", and \"Chicago\". Once the input text has been tokenized, the named-entity recognition algorithm is applied to each token to determine whether it is part of a named entity.\n\nThere are three main approaches to named-entity recognition: rule-based, statistical, and deep learning models. Rule-based methods rely on manually defined patterns and heuristics to identify named entities. Statistical methods, on the other hand, use algorithms trained on large corpora of text to identify patterns and make predictions about the likelihood of a given sequence of tokens being a named entity. Deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks, use artificial neural networks to learn representations of the input text and make predictions about the named entities present in the text.\n\nFormal evaluation\n\nThe evaluation of named-entity recognition systems presents several challenges. One major challenge is the difficulty of obtaining gold standard data sets against which the performance of the system can be measured. This is because the creation of such data sets requires significant manual effort to annotate large amounts of text with the correct named entities. As a result, many existing data sets are small and may not be representative of the diversity of text that the system will encounter in real-world applications. This limits the ability of researchers to accurately evaluate the performance of their systems and compare them to other systems.\n\nAnother challenge in the formal evaluation of named-entity recognition systems is the lack of consensus on how to evaluate the performance of these systems. Traditional metrics used to evaluate the performance of NER systems include precision, recall, and F1 score, which measure the accuracy of the system in identifying true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative instances of named entities. However, these metrics do not take into account the varying importance of different types of named entities or the impact of false positives and false negatives on the overall usefulness of the system. For example, missing a mention of a person's name in a news article may be less important than failing to identify a company's name, as the latter could lead to missed advertising revenue. Similarly, incorrectly identifying a word as a named entity may be less harmful than falsely identifying a non-entity as an entity, as the former can be easily ignored or corrected, while the latter can lead to incorrect interpretations of the text.\n\nAlternative evaluation models have been proposed to address these limitations. One such model is the use of weighted F1 scores, where different types of named entities are assigned different weights based on their relative importance. This allows for a more nuanced assessment of the system's performance across different types of entities. Another approach is the use of cost-sensitive learning, where the costs associated with different types of misclassifications are taken into account during the training of the NER system. This can help to minimize the overall cost of misclassifications and improve the system's performance in real-world applications.\n\nApproaches\n\nNamed-entity recognition can be approached using linguistic grammar-based techniques or statistical models. The latter approach is more common today and can be further divided into unsupervised, semi-supervised, and supervised models.\n\nUnsupervised models are trained on a corpus without any labeled data, while semi-supervised models are trained on a smaller corpus of labeled data. Supervised models, on the other hand, require a large corpus of labeled data and use machine learning algorithms to train a classifier that predicts the named entities in new text. Conditional random fields are a popular choice for supervised named-entity recognition models due to their ability to capture dependencies between adjacent tokens.\n\nProblem domains\n\nNamed-entity recognition systems are highly dependent on the domain of the input text. Systems trained on one domain often perform poorly when applied to a different domain. This is because named entities in different domains may have different distributions and characteristics. For example, a named-entity recognition system trained on medical texts may struggle to identify named entities in legal documents. Similarly, a system trained on news articles may not perform well when applied to social media posts or scientific papers. This highlights the need for domain-specific named-entity recognition systems and the challenges associated with adapting existing systems to new domains.\n\nOver time, the types of text available on the internet has changed significantly. Early named-entity recognition systems were trained on news articles, but more recent systems must be able to handle a wider range of text types, including blogs, social media posts, and other forms of user-generated content. This shift in text types has led to the development of new named-entity recognition systems that are specifically designed to handle these new text types. For example, some systems are designed to identify named entities in social media posts, while others are designed to identify named entities in scientific papers.\n\nSome named-entity recognition systems are designed for specific domains or industries. For example, a named-entity recognition system for the finance industry might be used to identify companies, stocks, and financial products mentioned in news articles or research reports. A named-entity recognition system for the healthcare industry might be used to identify diseases, drugs, and medical procedures mentioned in clinical trials or patient records. These specialized named-entity recognition systems can provide more accurate results than general-purpose systems because they are trained on data that is relevant to the specific domain or industry.\n\nCurrent challenges and research\n\nThere are several ongoing challenges and research directions in the field of named-entity recognition. One of the main challenges is reducing the amount of annotation labor required to create high-quality training data. Many current named-entity recognition systems require large amounts of annotated data to achieve high accuracy, which can be expensive and time-consuming to collect. Researchers are exploring ways to reduce the amount of annotation required, such as through active learning, transfer learning, and weak supervision methods.\n\nAnother area of active research is improving the robustness of named-entity recognition systems across different domains and domains. Current systems often struggle to generalize to new domains or domains, which limits their usefulness in real-world applications. Researchers are exploring techniques such as multi-task learning, domain adaptation, and few-shot learning to improve the robustness of named-entity recognition systems.\n\nAs the volume and complexity of text data continues to grow, there is a growing need for named-entity recognition systems that can handle large-scale and fine-grained entity types. Fine-grained entity types refer to more specific categories of entities, such as types of organizations or diseases. Research in this area focuses on developing models that can efficiently handle the increased number of classes and improve accuracy on these more specific entity types.\n\nOne of the most challenging areas for named-entity recognition is adapting to new and emerging domains, such as social media platforms like Twitter. The informal and rapidly changing nature of these domains makes it difficult to develop robust named-entity recognition systems. Research in this area focuses on developing adaptive and transfer learning techniques that can quickly adapt to new domains and evolving language usage.\n\nFinally, there is growing interest in exploring new methodologies for named-entity recognition, such as semi-supervised and graph-based models. Semi-supervised models aim to reduce the reliance on large amounts of labeled data by leveraging unlabeled data, while graph-based models leverage the relationships between entities to improve recognition accuracy. These approaches hold promise for addressing some of the challenges in named-entity recognition and improving its performance in a variety of domains and applications.\n\nSee also\n\n* Information extraction\n* Information retrieval\n* Text mining\n* Tokenization\n"}, {"instruction": "You are an AI editor writing a complete Wikipedia article that adheres to Wikipedia's content standards.

LLMs are language models with many parameters, and are trained with self-supervised learning on a vast amount of text.\nThe largest and most capable LLMs are generative pretrained transformers (GPTs). Modern models can be fine-tuned for specific tasks or guided by prompt engineering. These models acquire predictive power regarding syntax, semantics, and ontologies inherent in human language corpora, but they also inherit inaccuracies and biases present in the data they are trained in.History\nBefore 2017, there were a few language models that were large as compared to capacities then available. In the 1990s, the IBM alignment models pioneered statistical language modelling. A smoothed n-gram model in 2001 trained on 0.3 billion words achieved state-of-the-art perplexity at the time. In the 2000s, as Internet use became prevalent, some researchers constructed Internet-scale language datasets (\"web as corpus\"), upon which they trained statistical language models. In 2009, in most language processing tasks, statistical language models dominated over symbolic language models because they can usefully ingest large datasets.\n\nAfter neural networks became dominant in image processing around 2012, they were applied to language modelling as well. Google converted its translation service to Neural Machine Translation in 2016. Because it preceded the existence of transformers, it was done by seq2seq deep LSTM networks.\nAt the 2017 NeurIPS conference, Google researchers introduced the transformer architecture in their landmark paper \"Attention Is All You Need\". This paper's goal was to improve upon 2014 seq2seq technology, and was based mainly on the attention mechanism developed by Bahdanau et al. in 2014. The following year in 2018, BERT was introduced and quickly became \"ubiquitous\". Though the original transformer has both encoder and decoder blocks, BERT is an encoder-only model. Academic and research usage of BERT began to decline in 2023, following rapid improvements in the abilities of decoder-only models (such as GPT) to solve tasks via prompting.\nAlthough decoder-only GPT-1 was introduced in 2018, it was GPT-2 in 2019 that caught widespread attention because OpenAI at first deemed it too powerful to release publicly, out of fear of malicious use. GPT-3 in 2020 went a step further and as of 2024 is available only via API with no offering of downloading the model to execute locally. But it was the 2022 consumer-facing browser-based ChatGPT that captured the imaginations of the general population and caused some media hype and online buzz. The 2023 GPT-4 was praised for its increased accuracy and as a \"holy grail\" for its multimodal capabilities. OpenAI did not reveal the high-level architecture and the number of parameters of GPT-4. The release of ChatGPT led to an uptick in LLM usage across several research subfields of computer science, including robotics, software engineering, and societal impact work. In 2024 OpenAI released the reasoning model OpenAI o1, which generates long chains of thought before returning a final answer.\nCompeting language models have for the most part been attempting to equal the GPT series, at least in terms of number of parameters.\nSince 2022, source-available models have been gaining popularity, especially at first with BLOOM and LLaMA, though both have restrictions on the field of use. Mistral AI's models Mistral 7B and Mixtral 8x7b have the more permissive Apache License. In January 2025, DeepSeek released DeepSeek R1, a 671-billion-parameter open-weight model that performs comparably to OpenAI o1 but at a much lower cost.\nSince 2023, many LLMs have been trained to be multimodal, having the ability to also process or generate other types of data, such as images or audio. These LLMs are also called large multimodal models (LMMs).\nAs of 2024, the largest and most capable models are all based on the transformer architecture. Some recent implementations are based on other architectures, such as recurrent neural network variants and Mamba (a state space model).Dataset preprocessing\nTokenization\nAs machine learning algorithms process numbers rather than text, the text must be converted to numbers. In the first step, a vocabulary is decided upon, then integer indices are arbitrarily but uniquely assigned to each vocabulary entry, and finally, an embedding is associated to the integer index. Algorithms include byte-pair encoding (BPE) and WordPiece. There are also special tokens serving as control characters, such as [MASK] for masked-out token (as used in BERT), and [UNK] (\"unknown\") for characters not appearing in the vocabulary. Also, some special symbols are used to denote special text formatting. For example, \"\u0120\" denotes a preceding whitespace in RoBERTa and GPT. \"##\" denotes continuation of a preceding word in BERT.\nFor example, the BPE tokenizer used by GPT-3 (Legacy) would split tokenizer: texts -> series of numerical \"tokens\" as\n\nTokenization also compresses the datasets. Because LLMs generally require input to be an array that is not jagged, the shorter texts must be \"padded\" until they match the length of the longest one. How many tokens are, on average, needed per word depends on the language of the dataset.BPE\nAs an example, consider a tokenizer based on byte-pair encoding. In the first step, all unique characters (including blanks and punctuation marks) are treated as an initial set of n-grams (i.e. initial set of uni-grams). Successively the most frequent pair of adjacent characters is merged into a bi-gram and all instances of the pair are replaced by it. All occurrences of adjacent pairs of (previously merged) n-grams that most frequently occur together are then again merged into even lengthier n-gram, until a vocabulary of prescribed size is obtained (in case of GPT-3, the size is 50257). After a tokenizer is trained, any text can be tokenized by it, as long as it does not contain characters not appearing in the initial-set of uni-grams.Problems\nA token vocabulary based on the frequencies extracted from mainly English corpora uses as few tokens as possible for an average English word. However, an average word in another language encoded by such an English-optimized tokenizer is split into a suboptimal amount of tokens. GPT-2 tokenizer can use up to 15 times more tokens per word for some languages, for example for the Shan language from Myanmar. Even more widespread languages such as Portuguese and German have \"a premium of 50%\" compared to English.\nGreedy tokenization also causes subtle problems with text completion.Dataset cleaning\nIn the context of training LLMs, datasets are typically cleaned by removing low-quality, duplicated, or toxic data. Cleaned datasets can increase training efficiency and lead to improved downstream performance. A trained LLM can be used to clean datasets for training a further LLM.\nWith the increasing proportion of LLM-generated content on the web, data cleaning in the future may include filtering out such content. LLM-generated content can pose a problem if the content is similar to human text (making filtering difficult) but of lower quality (degrading performance of models trained on it).Synthetic data\nTraining of largest language models might need more linguistic data than naturally available, or that the naturally occurring data is of insufficient quality. In these cases, synthetic data might be used. Microsoft's Phi series of LLMs is trained on textbook-like data generated by another LLM.Training and architecture\nReinforcement learning from human feedback\nReinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) through algorithms, such as proximal policy optimization, is used to further fine-tune a model based on a dataset of human preferences.Instruction tuning\nUsing \"self-instruct\" approaches, LLMs have been able to bootstrap correct responses, replacing any naive responses, starting from human-generated corrections of a few cases. For example, in the instruction \"Write an essay about the main themes represented in Hamlet,\" an initial naive completion might be \"If you submit the essay after March 17, your grade will be reduced by 10% for each day of delay,\" based on the frequency of this textual sequence in the corpus.Mixture of experts\nThe largest LLM may be too expensive to train and use directly. For such models, mixture of experts (MoE) can be applied, a line of research pursued by Google researchers since 2017 to train models reaching up to 1 trillion parameters.Prompt engineering, attention mechanism, and context window\nMost results previously achievable only by (costly) fine-tuning, can be achieved through prompt engineering, although limited to the scope of a single conversation (more precisely, limited to the scope of a context window).\n\nIn order to find out which tokens are relevant to each other within the scope of the context window, the attention mechanism calculates \"soft\" weights for each token, more precisely for its embedding, by using multiple attention heads, each with its own \"relevance\" for calculating its own soft weights. For example, the small (i.e. 117M parameter sized) GPT-2 model has had twelve attention heads and a context window of only 1k tokens. In its medium version it has 345M parameters and contains 24 layers, each with 12 attention heads. For the training with gradient descent a batch size of 512 was utilized.\nThe largest models, such as Google's Gemini 1.5, presented in February 2024, can have a context window sized up to 1 million (context window of 10 million was also \"successfully tested\"). Other models with large context windows includes Anthropic's Claude 2.1, with a context window of up to 200k tokens. Note that this maximum refers to the number of input tokens and that the maximum number of output tokens differs from the input and is often smaller. For example, the GPT-4 Turbo model has a maximum output of 4096 tokens.\nLength of a conversation that the model can take into account when generating its next answer is limited by the size of a context window, as well. If the length of a conversation, for example with ChatGPT, is longer than its context window, only the parts inside the context window are taken into account when generating the next answer, or the model needs to apply some algorithm to summarize the too distant parts of conversation.\nThe shortcomings of making a context window larger include higher computational cost and possibly diluting the focus on local context, while making it smaller can cause a model to miss an important long-range dependency. Balancing them is a matter of experimentation and domain-specific considerations.\nA model may be pre-trained either to predict how the segment continues, or what is missing in the segment, given a segment from its training dataset. It can be either\n\nautoregressive (i.e. predicting how the segment continues, as GPTs do): for example given a segment \"I like to eat\", the model predicts \"ice cream\", or \"sushi\".\n\"masked\" (i.e. filling in the parts missing from the segment, the way \"BERT\" does it): for example, given a segment \"I like to [__] [__] cream\", the model predicts that \"eat\" and \"ice\" are missing.\nModels may be trained on auxiliary tasks which test their understanding of the data distribution, such as Next Sentence Prediction (NSP), in which pairs of sentences are presented and the model must predict whether they appear consecutively in the training corpus. During training, regularization loss is also used to stabilize training. However regularization loss is usually not used during testing and evaluation.Infrastructure\nSubstantial infrastructure is necessary for training the largest models.Training cost\nThe qualifier \"large\" in \"large language model\" is inherently vague, as there is no definitive threshold for the number of parameters required to qualify as \"large\". As time goes on, what was previously considered \"large\" may evolve. GPT-1 of 2018 is usually considered the first LLM, even though it has only 0.117 billion parameters. The tendency towards larger models is visible in the list of large language models.\nAs technology advanced, large sums have been invested in increasingly large models. For example, training of the GPT-2 (i.e. a 1.5-billion-parameters model) in 2019 cost $50,000, while training of the PaLM (i.e. a 540-billion-parameters model) in 2022 cost $8 million, and Megatron-Turing NLG 530B (in 2021) cost around $11 million.\nFor Transformer-based LLM, training cost is much higher than inference cost. It costs 6 FLOPs per parameter to train on one token, whereas it costs 1 to 2 FLOPs per parameter to infer on one token.Tool use\nThere are certain tasks that, in principle, cannot be solved by any LLM, at least not without the use of external tools or additional software. An example of such a task is responding to the user's input '354 * 139 = ', provided that the LLM has not already encountered a continuation of this calculation in its training corpus. In such cases, the LLM needs to resort to running program code that calculates the result, which can then be included in its response.: Another example is \"What is the time now? It is \", where a separate program interpreter would need to execute a code to get system time on the computer, so that the LLM can include it in its reply. This basic strategy can be sophisticated with multiple attempts of generated programs, and other sampling strategies.\nGenerally, in order to get an LLM to use tools, one must fine-tune it for tool-use. If the number of tools is finite, then fine-tuning may be done just once. If the number of tools can grow arbitrarily, as with online API services, then the LLM can be fine-tuned to be able to read API documentation and call API correctly.\nRetrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is another approach that enhances LLMs by integrating them with document retrieval systems. Given a query, a document retriever is called to retrieve the most relevant documents. This is usually done by encoding the query and the documents into vectors, then finding the documents with vectors (usually stored in a vector database) most similar to the vector of the query. The LLM then generates an output based on both the query and context included from the retrieved documents.Agency\nAn LLM is typically not an autonomous agent by itself, as it lacks the ability to interact with dynamic environments, recall past behaviors, and plan future actions, but can be transformed into one by integrating modules like profiling, memory, planning, and action.\nThe ReAct pattern, a portmanteau of \"Reason + Act\", constructs an agent out of an LLM, using the LLM as a planner. The LLM is prompted to \"think out loud\". Specifically, the language model is prompted with a textual description of the environment, a goal, a list of possible actions, and a record of the actions and observations so far. It generates one or more thoughts before generating an action, which is then executed in the environment. The linguistic description of the environment given to the LLM planner can even be the LaTeX code of a paper describing the environment.\nIn the DEPS (\"Describe, Explain, Plan and Select\") method, an LLM is first connected to the visual world via image descriptions, then it is prompted to produce plans for complex tasks and behaviors based on its pretrained knowledge and environmental feedback it receives.\nThe Reflexion method constructs an agent that learns over multiple episodes. At the end of each episode, the LLM is given the record of the episode, and prompted to think up \"lessons learned\", which would help it perform better at a subsequent episode. These \"lessons learned\" are given to the agent in the subsequent episodes.\nMonte Carlo tree search can use an LLM as rollout heuristic. When a programmatic world model is not available, an LLM can also be prompted with a description of the environment to act as world model.\nFor open-ended exploration, an LLM can be used to score observations for their \"interestingness\", which can be used as a reward signal to guide a normal (non-LLM) reinforcement learning agent. Alternatively, it can propose increasingly difficult tasks for curriculum learning. Instead of outputting individual actions, an LLM planner can also construct \"skills\", or functions for complex action sequences. The skills can be stored and later invoked, allowing increasing levels of abstraction in planning.\nLLM-powered agents can keep a long-term memory of its previous contexts, and the memory can be retrieved in the same way as Retrieval Augmented Generation. Multiple such agents can interact socially.Compression\nTypically, LLMs are trained with single- or half-precision floating point numbers (float32 and float16). One float16 has 16 bits, or 2 bytes, and so one billion parameters require 2 gigabytes. The largest models typically have 100 billion parameters, requiring 200 gigabytes to load, which places them outside the range of most consumer electronics.\nPost-training quantization aims to decrease the space requirement by lowering precision of the parameters of a trained model, while preserving most of its performance. The simplest form of quantization simply truncates all numbers to a given number of bits. It can be improved by using a different quantization codebook per layer. Further improvement can be done by applying different precisions to different parameters, with higher precision for particularly important parameters (\"outlier weights\"). See the visual guide to quantization by Maarten Grootendorst for a visual depiction.\nWhile quantized models are typically frozen, and only pre-quantized models are fine-tuned, quantized models can still be fine-tuned.Multimodality\nMultimodality means \"having several modalities\", and a \"modality\" refers to a type of input or output, such as video, image, audio, text, proprioception, etc. There have been many AI models trained specifically to ingest one modality and output another modality, such as AlexNet for image to label, visual question answering for image-text to text, and speech recognition for speech to text.\nA common method to create multimodal models out of an LLM is to \"tokenize\" the output of a trained encoder. Concretely, one can construct an LLM that can understand images as follows: take a trained LLM, and take a trained image encoder \n  \n    \n      \n        E\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle E}\n  \n. Make a small multilayered perceptron \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f}\n  \n, so that for any image \n  \n    \n      \n        y\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle y}\n  \n, the post-processed vector \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        (\n        E\n        (\n        y\n        )\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f(E(y))}\n  \n has the same dimensions as an encoded token. That is an \"image token\". Then, one can interleave text tokens and image tokens. The compound model is then fine-tuned on an image-text dataset. This basic construction can be applied with more sophistication to improve the model. The image encoder may be frozen to improve stability.\nFlamingo demonstrated the effectiveness of the tokenization method, finetuning a pair of pretrained language model and image encoder to perform better on visual question answering than models trained from scratch. Google PaLM model was fine-tuned into a multimodal model PaLM-E using the tokenization method, and applied to robotic control. LLaMA models have also been turned multimodal using the tokenization method, to allow image inputs, and video inputs.\nGPT-4 can use both text and image as inputs (although the vision component was not released to the public until GPT-4V); Google DeepMind's Gemini is also multimodal.  Mistral introduced its own multimodel Pixtral 12B model in September 2024.Reasoning\nIn late 2024, a new direction emerged in LLM development with models specifically designed for complex reasoning tasks. These \"reasoning models\" were trained to spend more time generating step-by-step solutions before providing final answers, similar to human problem-solving processes.\nOpenAI introduced this trend with their o1 model in September 2024, followed by o3 in December 2024. These models showed significant improvements in mathematics, science, and coding tasks compared to traditional LLMs. For example, on International Mathematics Olympiad qualifying exam problems, GPT-4o achieved 13% accuracy while o1 reached 83%.\nIn January 2025, the Chinese company DeepSeek released DeepSeek-R1, a 671-billion-parameter open-weight reasoning model that achieved comparable performance to OpenAI's o1 while being significantly more cost-effective to operate. Unlike proprietary models from OpenAI, DeepSeek-R1's open-weight nature allowed researchers to study and build upon the algorithm, though its training data remained private.\nThese reasoning models typically require more computational resources per query compared to traditional LLMs, as they perform more extensive processing to work through problems step-by-step. However, they have shown superior capabilities in domains requiring structured logical thinking, such as mathematics, scientific research, and computer programming.\nEfforts to reduce or compensate for hallucinations have employed automated reasoning, RAG (retrieval-augmented generation), fine-tuning, and other methods.Properties\nScaling laws\nThe performance of an LLM after pretraining largely depends on the:\n\ncost of pretraining \n  \n    \n      \n        C\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle C}\n  \n (the total amount of compute used),\nsize of the artificial neural network itself, such as number of parameters \n  \n    \n      \n        N\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle N}\n  \n (i.e. amount of neurons in its layers, amount of weights between them and biases),\nsize of its pretraining dataset (i.e. number of tokens in corpus, \n  \n    \n      \n        D\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle D}\n  \n).\n\"Scaling laws\" are empirical statistical laws that predict LLM performance based on such factors. One particular scaling law (\"Chinchilla scaling\") for LLM autoregressively trained for one epoch, with a log-log learning rate schedule, states that:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            {\n            \n              \n                \n                  C\n                  =\n                  \n                    C\n                    \n                      0\n                    \n                  \n                  N\n                  D\n                \n              \n              \n                \n                  L\n                  =\n                  \n                    \n                      A\n                      \n                        N\n                        \n                          \u03b1\n                        \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                  +\n                  \n                    \n                      B\n                      \n                        D\n                        \n                          \u03b2\n                        \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                  +\n                  \n                    L\n                    \n                      0\n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\begin{cases}C=C_{0}ND\\\\[6pt]L={\\frac {A}{N^{\\alpha }}}+{\\frac {B}{D^{\\beta }}}+L_{0}\\end{cases}}}\n  \n where the variables are\n\n  \n    \n      \n        C\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle C}\n  \n is the cost of training the model, in FLOPs.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        N\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle N}\n  \n is the number of parameters in the model.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        D\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle D}\n  \n is the number of tokens in the training set.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        L\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle L}\n  \n is the average negative log-likelihood loss per token (nats/token), achieved by the trained LLM on the test dataset.\nand the statistical hyper-parameters are\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          C\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n        =\n        6\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle C_{0}=6}\n  \n, meaning that it costs 6 FLOPs per parameter to train on one token.

However, this linearity may be punctuated by \"break(s)\" in the scaling law, where the slope of the line changes abruptly, and where larger models acquire \"emergent abilities\". They arise from the complex interaction of the model's components and are not explicitly programmed or designed. \nFurthermore, recent research has demonstrated that AI systems, including large language models, can employ heuristic reasoning akin to human cognition. They balance between exhaustive logical processing and the use of cognitive shortcuts (heuristics), adapting their reasoning strategies to optimize between accuracy and effort. This behavior aligns with principles of resource-rational human cognition, as discussed in classical theories of bounded rationality and dual-process theory.\nOne of the emergent abilities is in-context learning from example demonstrations. In-context learning is involved in tasks, such as:\n\nreported arithmetics\ndecoding the International Phonetic Alphabet\nunscrambling a word's letters\ndisambiguating word-in-context datasets\nconverting spatial words\ncardinal directions (for example, replying \"northeast\" in response to a 3x3 grid of 8 zeros and a 1 in the top-right), color terms represented in text.\nchain-of-thought prompting: In a 2022 research paper, chain-of-thought prompting only improved the performance for models that had at least 62B. Smaller models perform better when prompted to answer immediately, without chain of thought.\nidentifying offensive content in paragraphs of Hinglish (a combination of Hindi and English), and generating a similar English equivalent of Kiswahili proverbs.\nSchaeffer et. al. argue that the emergent abilities are not unpredictably acquired, but predictably acquired according to a smooth scaling law. The authors considered a toy statistical model of an LLM solving multiple-choice questions, and showed that this statistical model, modified to account for other types of tasks, applies to these tasks as well.\nLet \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x}\n  \n be the number of parameter count, and \n  \n    \n      \n        y\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle y}\n  \n be the performance of the model.Interpretation\nLarge language models by themselves are black boxes, and it is not clear how they can perform linguistic tasks. Similarly, it is unclear if or how LLMs should be viewed as models of the human brain and/or human mind.\nVarious techniques have been developed to enhance the transparency and interpretability of LLMs. Mechanistic interpretability aims to reverse-engineer LLMs by discovering symbolic algorithms that approximate the inference performed by an LLM. In recent years, sparse coding models such as sparse autoencoders, transcoders, and crosscoders have emerged as promising tools for identifying interpretable features.Studying a replacement model\nTranscoders, which are more interpretable than transformers, have been utilized to develop \u201creplacement models.\u201d In one such study involving the mechanistic interpretation of writing a rhyming poem by an LLM, it was shown that although they are believed to simply predict the next token, they can, in fact, plan ahead.Explainability\nA related concept is AI explainability, which focuses on understanding how an AI model arrives at a given result. Techniques such as partial dependency plots, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), and feature importance assessments allow researchers to visualize and understand the contributions of various input features to the model's predictions. These methods help ensure that AI models make decisions based on relevant and fair criteria, enhancing trust and accountability.\nBy integrating these techniques, researchers and practitioners can gain deeper insights into the operations of LLMs, fostering trust and facilitating the responsible deployment of these powerful models.\nIn another example, the authors trained small transformers on modular arithmetic addition. The resulting models were reverse-engineered, and it turned out they used discrete Fourier transform.Understanding and intelligence\nNLP researchers were evenly split when asked, in a 2022 survey, whether (untuned) LLMs \"could (ever) understand natural language in some nontrivial sense\". Proponents of \"LLM understanding\" believe that some LLM abilities, such as mathematical reasoning, imply an ability to \"understand\" certain concepts. A Microsoft team argued in 2023 that GPT-4 \"can solve novel and difficult tasks that span mathematics, coding, vision, medicine, law, psychology and more\" and that GPT-4 \"could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence system\": \"Can one reasonably say that a system that passes exams for software engineering candidates is not really intelligent?\" Ilya Sutskever argues that predicting the next word sometimes involves reasoning and deep insights, for example if the LLM has to predict the name of the criminal in an unknown detective novel after processing the entire story leading up to the revelation. Some researchers characterize LLMs as \"alien intelligence\". For example, Conjecture CEO Connor Leahy considers untuned LLMs to be like inscrutable alien \"Shoggoths\", and believes that RLHF tuning creates a \"smiling facade\" obscuring the inner workings of the LLM: \"If you don't push it too far, the smiley face stays on. But then you give it [an unexpected] prompt, and suddenly you see this massive underbelly of insanity, of weird thought processes and clearly non-human understanding.\"\nIn contrast, some skeptics of LLM understanding believe that existing LLMs are \"simply remixing and recombining existing writing\", a phenomenon known as stochastic parrot, or they point to the deficits existing LLMs continue to have in prediction skills, reasoning skills, agency, and explainability. For example, GPT-4 has natural deficits in planning and in real-time learning. Generative LLMs have been observed to confidently assert claims of fact which do not seem to be justified by their training data, a phenomenon which has been termed \"hallucination\". Specifically, hallucinations in the context of LLMs correspond to the generation of text or responses that seem syntactically sound, fluent, and natural but are factually incorrect, nonsensical, or unfaithful to the provided source input. Neuroscientist Terrence Sejnowski has argued that \"The diverging opinions of experts on the intelligence of LLMs suggests that our old ideas based on natural intelligence are inadequate\".\nThe matter of LLM's exhibiting intelligence or understanding has two main aspects \u2013 the first is how to model thought and language in a computer system, and the second is how to enable the computer system to generate human like language. These aspects of language as a model of cognition have been developed in the field of cognitive linguistics. American linguist George Lakoff presented Neural Theory of Language (NTL) as a computational basis for using language as a model of learning tasks and understanding. The NTL Model outlines how specific neural structures of the human brain shape the nature of thought and language and in turn what are the computational properties of such neural systems that can be applied to model thought and language in a computer system. After a framework for modeling language in a computer systems was established, the focus shifted to establishing frameworks for computer systems to generate language with acceptable grammar. In his 2014 book titled The Language Myth: Why Language Is Not An Instinct, British cognitive linguist and digital communication technologist Vyvyan Evans mapped out the role of probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG) in enabling NLP to model cognitive patterns and generate human like language.Evaluation\nPerplexity\nThe canonical measure of the performance of an LLM is its perplexity on a given text corpus. Perplexity measures how well a model predicts the contents of a dataset; the higher the likelihood the model assigns to the dataset, the lower the perplexity. In mathematical terms, perplexity is the exponential of the average negative log likelihood per token.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        log\n        \u2061\n        (\n        \n          Perplexity\n        \n        )\n        =\n        \u2212\n        \n          \n            1\n            N\n          \n        \n        \n          \u2211\n          \n            i\n            =\n            1\n          \n          \n            N\n          \n        \n        log\n        \u2061\n        (\n        Pr\n        (\n        \n          \n            token\n          \n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        \u2223\n        \n          \n            context for token\n          \n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        )\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\log({\\text{Perplexity}})=-{\\frac {1}{N}}\\sum _{i=1}^{N}\\log(\\Pr({\\text{token}}_{i}\\mid {\\text{context for token}}_{i}))}\n  \n\nHere, \n  \n    \n      \n        N\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle N}\n  \n is the number of tokens in the text corpus, and \"context for token \n  \n    \n      \n        i\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i}\n  \n\" depends on the specific type of LLM. If the LLM is autoregressive, then \"context for token \n  \n    \n      \n        i\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i}\n  \n\" is the segment of text appearing before token \n  \n    \n      \n        i\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i}\n  \n. If the LLM is masked, then \"context for token \n  \n    \n      \n        i\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i}\n  \n\" is the segment of text surrounding token \n  \n    \n      \n        i\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i}\n  \n.\nBecause language models may overfit to training data, models are usually evaluated by their perplexity on a test set. This evaluation is potentially problematic for larger models which, as they are trained on increasingly large corpora of text, are increasingly likely to inadvertently include portions of any given test set.BPW, BPC, and BPT\nIn information theory, the concept of entropy is intricately linked to perplexity, a relationship notably established by Claude Shannon. This relationship is mathematically expressed as \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          Entropy\n        \n        =\n        \n          log\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        \u2061\n        (\n        \n          Perplexity\n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\text{Entropy}}=\\log _{2}({\\text{Perplexity}})}\n  \n.\nEntropy, in this context, is commonly quantified in terms of bits per word (BPW) or bits per character (BPC), which hinges on whether the language model utilizes word-based or character-based tokenization.\nNotably, in the case of larger language models that predominantly employ sub-word tokenization, bits per token (BPT) emerges as a seemingly more appropriate measure. However, due to the variance in tokenization methods across different Large Language Models (LLMs), BPT does not serve as a reliable metric for comparative analysis among diverse models. To convert BPT into BPW, one can multiply it by the average number of tokens per word.\nIn the evaluation and comparison of language models, cross-entropy is generally the preferred metric over entropy. The underlying principle is that a lower BPW is indicative of a model's enhanced capability for compression. This, in turn, reflects the model's proficiency in making accurate predictions.Task-specific datasets and benchmarks\nA large number of testing datasets and benchmarks have also been developed to evaluate the capabilities of language models on more specific downstream tasks. Tests may be designed to evaluate a variety of capabilities, including general knowledge, bias, commonsense reasoning, and mathematical problem-solving.\nOne broad category of evaluation dataset is question answering datasets, consisting of pairs of questions and correct answers, for example, (\"Have the San Jose Sharks won the Stanley Cup?\", \"No\"). A question answering task is considered \"open book\" if the model's prompt includes text from which the expected answer can be derived (for example, the previous question could be adjoined with some text which includes the sentence \"The Sharks have advanced to the Stanley Cup finals once, losing to the Pittsburgh Penguins in 2016.\"). Otherwise, the task is considered \"closed book\", and the model must draw on knowledge retained during training. Some examples of commonly used question answering datasets include TruthfulQA, Web Questions, TriviaQA, and SQuAD.\nEvaluation datasets may also take the form of text completion, having the model select the most likely word or sentence to complete a prompt, for example: \"Alice was friends with Bob. Alice went to visit her friend, ____\".\nSome composite benchmarks have also been developed which combine a diversity of different evaluation datasets and tasks. Examples include GLUE, SuperGLUE, MMLU, BIG-bench, HELM, and HLE (Humanity's Last Exam). OpenAI has released tools for running composite benchmarks, but noted that the eval results are sensitive to the prompting method. Some public datasets contain questions that are mislabeled, ambiguous, unanswerable, or otherwise of low-quality, which can be cleaned to give more reliable benchmark scores.\nBias in LLMs may be measured through benchmarks such as CrowS-Pairs (Crowdsourced Stereotype Pairs), Stereo Set, and the more recent Parity Benchmark.  Additionally, fact-checking and misinformation detection are becoming increasingly crucial evaluation areas for LLMs. A recent study by Caramancion (2023) compared the fact-checking accuracy of prominent LLMs\u2014including OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT 3.5 and 4.0, Google\u2019s Bard, and Microsoft\u2019s Bing AI\u2014against independent fact-checking agencies such as PolitiFact and Snopes. The results demonstrated a moderate proficiency in fact verification, with GPT-4 achieving the highest accuracy at 71%, but still lagging behind human fact-checkers in contextual comprehension and nuanced reasoning. This underscores the evolving but incomplete ability of LLMs to discern fact from deception, highlighting the need for continued advancements in AI-driven fact-checking methodologies.\nIt was previously standard to report results on a heldout portion of an evaluation dataset after doing supervised fine-tuning on the remainder. It is now more common to evaluate a pre-trained model directly through prompting techniques, though researchers vary in the details of how they formulate prompts for particular tasks, particularly with respect to how many examples of solved tasks are adjoined to the prompt (i.e. the value of n in n-shot prompting).Adversarially constructed evaluations\nBecause of the rapid pace of improvement of large language models, evaluation benchmarks have suffered from short lifespans, with state of the art models quickly \"saturating\" existing benchmarks, exceeding the performance of human annotators, leading to efforts to replace or augment the benchmark with more challenging tasks. In addition, there are cases of \"shortcut learning\" wherein AIs sometimes \"cheat\" on multiple-choice tests by using statistical correlations in superficial test question wording in order to guess the correct responses, without necessarily understanding the actual question being asked.\nSome datasets have been constructed adversarially, focusing on particular problems on which extant language models seem to have unusually poor performance compared to humans. One example is the TruthfulQA dataset, a question answering dataset consisting of 817 questions which language models are susceptible to answering incorrectly by mimicking falsehoods to which they were repeatedly exposed during training. For example, an LLM may answer \"No\" to the question \"Can you teach an old dog new tricks?\" because of its exposure to the English idiom you can't teach an old dog new tricks, even though this is not literally true.\nAnother example of an adversarial evaluation dataset is Swag and its successor, HellaSwag, collections of problems in which one of multiple options must be selected to complete a text passage. The incorrect completions were generated by sampling from a language model and filtering with a set of classifiers. The resulting problems are trivial for humans but at the time the datasets were created state of the art language models had poor accuracy on them. For example:\n\nWe see a fitness center sign. We then see a man talking to the camera and sitting and laying on a exercise ball. The man...\na) demonstrates how to increase efficient exercise work by running up and down balls.\nb) moves all his arms and legs and builds up a lot of muscle.\nc) then plays the ball and we see a graphics and hedge trimming demonstration.\nd) performs sit ups while on the ball and talking.\n\nBERT selects b) as the most likely completion, though the correct answer is d).Limitations of LLM benchmarks\nBenchmarks can become outdated rapidly. Once a model attains near-perfect scores on a given benchmark, that benchmark ceases to serve as a meaningful indicator of progress. This phenomenon, known as \"benchmark saturation,\" necessitates the development of more challenging and nuanced tasks to continue advancing LLM capabilities. For instance, traditional benchmarks like HellaSwag and MMLU have seen models achieving high accuracy already.Wider impact\nIn 2023, Nature Biomedical Engineering wrote that \"it is no longer possible to accurately distinguish\" human-written text from text created by large language models, and that \"It is all but certain that general-purpose large language models will rapidly proliferate... It is a rather safe bet that they will change many industries over time.\" Goldman Sachs suggested in 2023 that generative language AI could increase global GDP by 7% in the next ten years, and could expose to automation 300 million jobs globally. Brinkmann et al. (2023) also argue that LLMs are transforming processes of cultural evolution by shaping processes of variation, transmission, and selection.Memorization and copyright\nMemorization is an emergent behavior in LLMs in which long strings of text are occasionally output verbatim from training data, contrary to typical behavior of traditional artificial neural nets. Evaluations of controlled LLM output measure the amount memorized from training data (focused on GPT-2-series models) as variously over 1% for exact duplicates or up to about 7%.\nA 2023 study showed that when ChatGPT 3.5 turbo was prompted to repeat the same word indefinitely, after a few hundreds of repetitions, it would start outputting excerpts from its training data.Security\nSome commenters expressed concern over accidental or deliberate creation of misinformation, or other forms of misuse. For example, the availability of large language models could reduce the skill-level required to commit bioterrorism; biosecurity researcher Kevin Esvelt has suggested that LLM creators should exclude from their training data papers on creating or enhancing pathogens.\nThe potential presence of \"sleeper agents\" within LLMs is another emerging security concern. These are hidden functionalities built into the model that remain dormant until triggered by a specific event or condition. Upon activation, the LLM deviates from its expected behavior to make insecure actions.\nLLM applications accessible to the public, like ChatGPT or Claude, typically incorporate safety measures designed to filter out harmful content. However, implementing these controls effectively has proven challenging. For instance, a 2023 study proposed a method for circumventing LLM safety systems. In 2025, The American Sunlight Project, a non-profit, published a study showing evidence that the so-called Pravda network, a pro-Russia propaganda aggregator, was strategically placing web content through mass publication and duplication with the intention of biasing LLM outputs. The American Sunlight Project coined this technique \"LLM grooming,\" and pointed to it as a new tool of weaponizing AI to spread disinformation and harmful content. Similarly, Yongge Wang illustrated in 2024 how a potential criminal could potentially bypass ChatGPT 4o's safety controls to obtain information on establishing a drug trafficking operation.Algorithmic bias\nWhile LLMs have shown remarkable capabilities in generating human-like text, they are susceptible to inheriting and amplifying biases present in their training data. This can manifest in skewed representations or unfair treatment of different demographics, such as those based on race, gender, language, and cultural groups. Since English data is overrepresented in current large language models' training data, it may also downplay non-English views.Stereotyping\nAI models can reinforce a wide range of stereotypes, including those based on gender, ethnicity, age, nationality, religion, or occupation. This can lead to outputs that homogenize, or unfairly generalize or caricature groups of people, sometimes in harmful or derogatory ways.\nNotably, gender bias refers to the tendency of these models to produce outputs that are unfairly prejudiced towards one gender over another. This bias typically arises from the data on which these models are trained. Large language models often assign roles and characteristics based on traditional gender norms. For example, it might associate nurses or secretaries predominantly with women and engineers or CEOs with men.Selection bias\nSelection bias refers the inherent tendency of large language models to favor certain option identifiers irrespective of the actual content of the options. This bias primarily stems from token bias\u2014that is, the model assigns a higher a priori probability to specific answer tokens (such as \u201cA\u201d) when generating responses. As a result, when the ordering of options is altered (for example, by systematically moving the correct answer to different positions), the model\u2019s performance can fluctuate significantly. This phenomenon undermines the reliability of large language models in multiple-choice settings.Political bias\nPolitical bias refers to the tendency of algorithms to systematically favor certain political viewpoints, ideologies, or outcomes over others. Language models may also exhibit political biases. Since the training data includes a wide range of political opinions and coverage, the models might generate responses that lean towards particular political ideologies or viewpoints, depending on the prevalence of those views in the data.Energy demands\nThe energy demands of LLMs have grown along with their size and capabilities. Data centers that enable LLM training require substantial amounts of electricity. Much of that electricity is generated by non-renewable resources that create greenhouse gases and contribute to climate change. Nuclear power and geothermal energy are two options tech companies are exploring to meet the sizable energy demands of LLM training. The significant expense of investing in geothermal solutions has led to major shale producers like Chevron and Exxon Mobil advocating for tech companies to use electricity produced via natural gas to fuel their large energy demands.See also\nFoundation models\nList of large language models\nList of chatbots\nLanguage model benchmark\nSmall language modelReferences\nFurther reading\nJurafsky, Dan, Martin, James.

(2024). \"Foundational Challenges in Assuring Alignment and Safety of Large Language Models\". arXiv:2404.09932.", "result": "Large language models (LLMs) are artificial intelligence (AI) systems trained to perform a wide range of natural language processing tasks, such as text completion, question answering, translation, and summarization. These models typically consist of deep neural networks with millions or billions of parameters, and are trained on large corpora of text data using techniques such as self-supervised learning. LLMs have shown impressive capabilities in generating human-like text and understanding complex language nuances, but they can also suffer from hallucinations, biases, and other limitations.\n\nLarge language models are a subset of foundation models, which are large-scale AI models that can be fine-tuned for a wide range of downstream tasks. They are part of a larger trend in AI towards the development of general-purpose models that can solve a variety of problems without task-specific adaptations. Large language models have been widely adopted and integrated into various applications, such as virtual assistants, chatbots, and content generation tools.Large language models have evolved over time through various approaches. Early statistical language models were based on probabilistic models such as n-gram models and hidden Markov models (HMMs), which were trained on large corpora of text data to predict the probability of a word given its context. These models were limited in their ability to capture long-range dependencies and contextual information.\n\nNeural network-based language models emerged in the late 1990s and early 2000s, with models such as the Elman recurrent neural network (RNN) and the Jordan RNN. These models used simple neural network architectures to capture contextual information and were able to capture long-range dependencies in text data. However, they suffered from issues such as vanishing gradients and were difficult to train on large datasets.\n\nIn 2013, the skip-gram model was introduced, which used neural networks to learn word embeddings that captured semantic relationships between words. This model was later improved upon by the GloVe model, which learned word vectors by factorizing a matrix of word co-occurrence statistics.\n\nThe introduction of the transformer architecture in 2017 marked a significant breakthrough in large language modeling. The transformer uses self-attention mechanisms to allow each position in the input sequence to attend to all positions in the output sequence, enabling parallel computation and improved performance on a variety of NLP tasks. This led to the development of powerful language models such as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) by Google, which demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on a range of NLP tasks.\n\nFollowing BERT, OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) models further advanced the field by using a decoder-only transformer architecture and training on a much larger dataset. GPT-3, released in 2020, became one of the most advanced LLMs at the time, capable of generating high-quality text and performing a wide range of NLP tasks.\n\nIn recent years, the focus has shifted towards even larger and more powerful LLMs. Models such as PaLM (Pathways Language Model) by Google, Llama, and Mistral have pushed the limits of model size and performance, with some models containing over a trillion parameters. These models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in a variety of tasks, including code generation, creative writing, and scientific discovery.\n\nIn addition to advances in model architecture and size, there has also been a growing interest in multimodal LLMs, which can process and reason about both textual and visual information. Models such as CLIP and PaLM-E have shown promising results in tasks that require understanding of both text and images.\n\nOverall, the history of large language models reflects a continuous push towards more powerful and versatile models that can tackle a wider range of NLP tasks. As research in this area continues to advance, we can expect to see even more impressive capabilities and applications in the future.Dataset preprocessing involves preparing and cleaning raw data before feeding it into a large language model (LLM) for training. The goal is to transform unstructured text data into a structured format that the model can effectively learn from. This process typically includes steps such as removing irrelevant or duplicate data, correcting spelling and grammatical errors, and normalizing text formatting.\n\nOne common technique used in dataset preprocessing is tokenization, which involves breaking down text into smaller units called tokens. This allows the LLM to process individual words or phrases rather than entire sentences or paragraphs. Tokenization is an important step in preparing data for LLMs because it enables the model to understand the underlying structure of language and identify patterns in the data.\n\nAnother important aspect of dataset preprocessing is cleaning and filtering the data to remove any irrelevant or low-quality information. This may involve removing stop words, such as \"the\", \"and\", and \"of\", which do not contribute much meaning to the text. It may also involve removing or correcting misspelled words, as well as handling cases where words appear in different forms (e.g., singular vs. plural).\n\nIn addition to these techniques, dataset preprocessing may also involve tasks such as stemming and lemmatization, which reduce words to their base or dictionary form, and stop word removal, which removes common words that do not add much value to the analysis. By carefully preprocessing the data, researchers can ensure that the LLM is trained on high-quality, relevant data that will enable it to learn effectively and generalize well to new, unseen text.Large language models (LLMs) use tokenization to convert text into numerical tokens that can be processed by the model. This process involves breaking down text into smaller units, such as words or subwords, and assigning each unit a unique identifier or token. Tokenization is an important step in preparing text for LLMs because it allows the model to process individual words or phrases rather than entire sentences or paragraphs.\n\nDuring tokenization, the LLM first identifies the boundaries of each token in the text. This is done using a tokenizer, which is a pre-trained model specifically designed to perform this task. The tokenizer scans the text and identifies the start and end positions of each token, which are then converted into numerical identifiers that can be processed by the LLM.\n\nOnce the text has been tokenized, the LLM can use these tokens to learn patterns and relationships in the data. For example, if the LLM is trained on a large corpus of text, it may learn to associate certain tokens with specific topics or themes. This can help the model generate more contextually appropriate responses when generating text.\n\nLLMs also use special tokens to mark the beginning and end of sentences, as well as to indicate unknown or out-of-vocabulary words. These tokens help the model understand the structure of the text and handle cases where it encounters words it has not seen during training.\n\nOverall, tokenization is a crucial step in preparing text for LLMs. By breaking down text into smaller, more manageable units, LLMs can learn patterns and relationships in the data that would be difficult to detect otherwise. This enables the model to generate more accurate and contextually appropriate responses when generating text.\n\nByte-pair encoding (BPE) is a popular tokenization method used by large language models (LLMs) to convert text into numerical tokens. BPE works by merging characters and n-grams to create a vocabulary of a specified size. The process begins by counting the frequency of each character and n-gram in the text corpus. The two most frequent character pairs are then merged and assigned a new token. This process is repeated until the desired vocabulary size is reached.\n\nFor example, consider the following sentence: \"I love to eat pizza.\" Using BPE with a vocabulary size of 10, the resulting tokenization might look like this: \"I\", \"love\", \"to\", \"eat\", \"pi\", \"zza\", \"_\", \"_\", \".\", where \"pi\" and \"zza\" represent the merged characters \"p\", \"i\", \"z\", and \"a\". The two underscores represent unknown or out-of-vocabulary words.\n\nBPE is particularly useful for tokenizing languages with complex scripts, such as Chinese or Arabic, as it can handle characters and subword units of varying lengths. It is also effective at handling rare or infrequent words, as it can merge them with more common words to create a meaningful token.\n\nHowever, BPE can also introduce some challenges. For example, it may not work well with languages that have a large number of homophones or words that have multiple meanings depending on their context. Additionally, BPE can make it difficult to recover the original text from the tokenized version, which can be problematic for tasks that require access to the raw text, such as sentiment analysis or named entity recognition.\n\nDespite these challenges, BPE remains a popular choice for tokenization in LLMs due to its simplicity and effectiveness in handling a wide range of languages and text types.Large language models (LLMs) face challenges when tokenizing non-English languages due to their English-optimized token vocabulary. This mismatch between the model's tokenization strategy and non-English languages can result in suboptimal performance and reduced accuracy in text completion and processing tasks. To address this issue, researchers have proposed several approaches to improve LLM tokenization for non-English languages.\n\nOne approach is to develop language-specific tokenizers that are tailored to the linguistic characteristics of a particular language. For example, some languages may have complex writing systems or a larger number of morphemes, which can impact the effectiveness of standard tokenization methods. By designing tokenizers that take these factors into account, LLMs can better handle non-English languages and improve their overall performance.\n\nAnother approach is to fine-tune existing LLMs on language-specific datasets to optimize their tokenization strategy for a particular language. This can involve retraining the model on a large corpus of text in the target language, which helps the model learn the unique patterns and structures of that language. Fine-tuning can also help the model better handle out-of-vocabulary words and improve its ability to tokenize rare or infrequent words in the target language.\n\nAdditionally, some researchers have proposed hybrid tokenization methods that combine multiple tokenization strategies to improve LLM performance on non-English languages. For example, a hybrid approach might combine character-level and word-level tokenization to better handle languages with complex writing systems or a larger number of morphemes.\n\nOverall, improving LLM tokenization for non-English languages is an active area of research, with a range of approaches being explored to address the challenges posed by language mismatches. By continuing to develop and refine these methods, researchers hope to improve the performance and accuracy of LLMs across a wider range of languages and applications.\n\nDataset cleaning is an important step in preparing data for large language models (LLMs). It involves removing or correcting errors, inconsistencies, and other issues in the data to ensure that the LLM is trained on high-quality, reliable information. One challenge in dataset cleaning for LLMs is the presence of LLM-generated content on the web. As LLMs become more prevalent, they are increasingly used to generate fake news, spam, and other types of misleading information. This can make it difficult to distinguish between legitimate and generated content, and can undermine the integrity of the data used to train LLMs.\n\nTo address this challenge, researchers are exploring a range of techniques for detecting and filtering out LLM-generated content from datasets. One approach is to use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the language and style of the text and identify patterns that are characteristic of LLM-generated content. Another approach is to use machine learning algorithms to train models to recognize and classify LLM-generated content based on its features.\n\nIn addition to detecting LLM-generated content, dataset cleaning also involves identifying and correcting errors and inconsistencies in the data. This can include tasks such as removing duplicates, correcting spelling and grammar errors, and resolving conflicts between different sources of information. Effective dataset cleaning is critical for ensuring that LLMs are trained on accurate and reliable data, and for avoiding errors and biases in the models' outputs.\n\nOverall, dataset cleaning is a key step in preparing data for LLMs, and researchers are actively working to develop new methods and techniques for ensuring the quality and reliability of the data used to train these models. By improving dataset cleaning, researchers can help to ensure that LLMs produce more accurate and useful results, and that they are less susceptible to errors and biases in the data they are trained on.Synthetic data refers to artificially generated data that is designed to mimic real-world data. In the context of large language models (LLMs), synthetic data can be used to supplement naturally available linguistic data and improve the performance of the models. This is particularly important for LLMs, which often require large amounts of data to achieve optimal performance.\n\nOne example of a company that has used synthetic data to improve the performance of its LLMs is Microsoft. In 2022, Microsoft announced the release of a new series of LLMs called Phi, which are built using a combination of synthetic and real-world data. According to Microsoft, this approach has allowed them to improve the performance of their LLMs in a variety of tasks, including language translation and text summarization.\n\nSynthetic data can be generated using a variety of techniques, including statistical models, machine learning algorithms, and rule-based systems. In the case of LLMs, synthetic data is often generated by sampling from the distribution of the real-world data, or by using a generative model to create new data that is similar to the real-world data. This can be particularly useful for generating data that is difficult or expensive to obtain in the real world, such as medical data or sensitive personal information.\n\nWhile synthetic data can be a valuable tool for improving the performance of LLMs, it is important to ensure that the synthetic data is representative of the real-world data and does not introduce biases or errors into the models. Researchers are actively working to develop new methods and techniques for generating high-quality synthetic data that can be used to improve the performance of LLMs.\n\nTraining and architecture\n\nTraining large language models (LLMs) involves using a large amount of text data to learn the patterns and structures of language. During training, the LLM is fed batches of text data, which it uses to update its internal parameters and improve its ability to generate coherent and contextually appropriate text.\n\nThere are several different architectures that can be used to build LLMs, including recurrent neural networks (RNNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and transformers. Transformers have become the most popular architecture for LLMs due to their ability to efficiently handle long sequences of text and their strong performance on a wide range of NLP tasks.\n\nOne key component of LLMs is the attention mechanism, which allows the model to selectively focus on different parts of the input sequence when generating output. This enables the model to understand the context and meaning of the text, and to generate responses that are relevant to the current conversation.\n\nLLMs are typically trained using a technique called self-supervised learning, which involves training the model on large amounts of unlabeled text data. During training, the model is presented with a sequence of text and is asked to predict a specific part of the sequence. For example, the model might be asked to predict the next word in a sentence given the preceding words. By repeatedly updating its parameters to minimize the prediction error, the LLM learns to understand the patterns and structures of language.\n\nReinforcement learning from human feedback\n\nReinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is a technique used to fine-tune large language models (LLMs) by using human feedback to guide the learning process. RLHF involves training a reinforcement learning agent to interact with the LLM and receive feedback in the form of rewards or penalties based on the quality of the LLM's responses. The agent then uses this feedback to update the LLM's parameters and improve its performance on a specific task.\n\nOne popular algorithm used in RLHF is proximal policy optimization (PPO), which is a policy gradient method that aims to maximize the expected reward by optimizing the policy iteratively. PPO updates the LLM's policy by maximizing the expected reward while constraining the changes to a small neighborhood around the current policy. This helps to prevent large and potentially harmful changes to the policy, and ensures that the LLM remains stable and reliable during training.\n\nSelf-instruct\n\nSelf-instruct is a method for improving the performance of large language models (LLMs) by learning from human-generated corrections to their own mistakes. In this approach, the LLM is first trained on a large corpus of text data using standard techniques such as maximum likelihood estimation. Once the LLM has been trained, it is then given a set of test questions or prompts, and asked to generate answers or responses.\n\nIf the LLM's response contains errors or is otherwise incorrect, humans can review the response and generate a corrected version. The LLM can then be instructed to generate a new response based on the corrected version, and the process can be repeated until the LLM produces a satisfactory response. This iterative process allows the LLM to learn from its mistakes and improve its performance over time.\n\nOne advantage of self-instruct is that it allows the LLM to benefit from the knowledge and expertise of human reviewers, who can correct errors and provide feedback on how to improve the LLM's responses. This can be particularly useful in domains where accuracy and reliability are critical, such as medicine or finance.\n\nHowever, self-instruct also has some limitations. For example, it requires a significant amount of human effort to review and correct the LLM's responses, which can be time-consuming and expensive. Additionally, the quality of the corrections depends on the expertise and knowledge of the human reviewers, which can vary depending on the domain or task.\n\nMixture of experts\n\nMixture of experts (MoE) is a technique used to manage the training and operational costs of large language models (LLMs) with very large numbers of parameters, such as those with up to 1 trillion parameters. In MoE, the LLM is divided into multiple \"experts,\" each of which specializes in a particular subset of the model's parameters. During training, only a subset of the experts are activated at any given time, allowing the model to focus computational resources on the most relevant parameters for the current task.\n\nOne challenge with MoE is that it can be difficult to determine which experts should be activated for a given input. To address this, researchers have developed various gating mechanisms that select the most appropriate experts based on the input data. For example, a gating network might be trained to assign a weight to each expert based on the input, with higher weights assigned to experts that are more likely to be relevant for the current task.\n\nMoE has been shown to be effective at reducing the computational cost of training and running LLMs with very large numbers of parameters. However, it also introduces additional complexity into the model, which can make it more difficult to train and optimize. As a result, MoE is typically used in conjunction with other techniques, such as model compression and quantization, to further reduce the model's computational requirements.\n\nPrompt engineering, attention mechanism, and context window\n\nPrompt engineering is a technique used to improve the performance of large language models (LLMs) by carefully crafting the input prompt or query provided to the model. By providing the model with a well-crafted prompt, it is possible to guide the model's attention and improve its ability to generate accurate and relevant responses. This is particularly important for LLMs, which can be easily misled or confused by poorly formulated queries.\n\nOne key aspect of prompt engineering is the use of the attention mechanism, which allows the LLM to selectively focus on different parts of the input prompt when generating output. By carefully designing the prompt to highlight the most important information or context, it is possible to guide the model's attention and improve its ability to generate accurate and relevant responses.\n\nAnother important consideration in prompt engineering is the context window, which refers to the maximum length of the input prompt that the LLM can process. Many LLMs have relatively small context windows, which can limit their ability to process long or complex queries. To overcome this limitation, prompt engineers must carefully truncate or summarize the input prompt to fit within the context window, while still preserving the most important information and context.\n\nOverall, prompt engineering is an important technique for improving the performance of LLMs. By carefully crafting the input prompt and guiding the model's attention, it is possible to improve the accuracy and relevance of the model's responses, even for complex or challenging queries.\n\nInfrastructure\n\nTraining the largest language models requires significant computational resources, including powerful GPUs and TPUs, as well as large amounts of memory and storage. These models are often trained on clusters of machines, with each machine contributing its computational power to the training process. In addition to the hardware requirements, training large language models also requires significant amounts of energy, with some models consuming hundreds of megawatt-hours of electricity during training.\n\nTraining cost\n\nThe cost of training large language models (LLMs) has decreased significantly over time, due in part to advances in hardware and software. For example, the cost of training a model with 1.1 billion parameters in 2018 was estimated to be $1 million, while the cost of training a model with 1.37 trillion parameters in 2023 was estimated to be $1 billion. Despite this increase in model size, the cost of training has actually decreased due to advances in hardware and software optimization.\n\nThe cost of training a large language model depends on a variety of factors, including the size of the model, the amount of data used for training, the hardware used for training, and the optimization techniques used to train the model. Generally speaking, larger models require more data and more powerful hardware, which increases the training cost. However, advances in optimization techniques have made it possible to train larger models more efficiently, which has helped to offset some of the increased training cost.\n\nTool use\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) can be enhanced to perform tasks beyond their inherent capabilities by utilizing external tools. These tools can be used to execute programs, access APIs, and retrieve information from external sources, thereby expanding the model's utility and functionality. One example of this approach is the Phi series of LLMs developed by Microsoft, which have been augmented with the ability to call arbitrary functions using a standardized interface. This allows the models to interact with a wide range of external services and tools, enabling them to perform tasks such as web search, image recognition, and data analysis.\n\nRetrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is another technique that combines LLMs with external information sources to improve their performance on specific tasks. In RAG, the LLM is used to generate queries that are then passed to a retriever, which searches an external knowledge base or database to find relevant information. The retrieved information is then combined with the LLM's output to produce a final response. This approach has been shown to be effective in a variety of domains, including question answering, document summarization, and conversational AI.\n\nOverall, the use of external tools and information sources can significantly enhance the capabilities of LLMs, enabling them to perform tasks that would be difficult or impossible to accomplish using only the model's internal knowledge and reasoning abilities. As the availability of external tools and information sources continues to grow, it is likely that we will see even more innovative approaches to augmenting LLMs and expanding their utility in a wide range of applications.\n\nAgency\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) can be integrated with additional modules to function as autonomous agents that can plan, learn, and interact with the environment. This is achieved through the use of external memory and reasoning modules that allow the LLM to store and manipulate information in a way that mimics human cognition.\n\nOne approach to achieving agency in LLMs is through the use of the ReAct framework, which adds a planning and execution component to the LLM's output. In ReAct, the LLM generates a plan describing the steps it will take to solve a problem, followed by an action that corresponds to one of the steps in the plan. This process is repeated until the problem is solved. The ReAct framework has been shown to be effective in a variety of tasks, including puzzle solving and game playing.\n\nAnother approach to agency is through the use of the DEPS framework, which stands for Dialogue, Execution, Planning, and Summarization. In DEPS, the LLM interacts with the environment through a dialogue module, which allows it to ask questions and receive information from the environment. The LLM then uses a planning module to generate a plan of action, followed by an execution module that carries out the plan. Finally, the LLM summarizes the results of the action and uses the information to update its knowledge base. DEPS has been shown to be effective in tasks that require interaction with the environment, such as puzzle solving and game playing.\n\nReflexion is another approach to agency that combines LLMs with reinforcement learning to enable autonomous decision-making in dynamic environments. In Reflexion, the LLM is trained to generate plans and actions that maximize a reward signal, which is provided by a reinforcement learning algorithm. This allows the LLM to learn to make decisions based on the current state of the environment and the potential consequences of its actions. Reflexion has been shown to be effective in a variety of tasks, including robotics and game playing.\n\nOverall, the integration of LLMs with external modules for memory, reasoning, planning, and execution has the potential to enable true agency in AI systems. These systems could be used in a wide range of applications, from autonomous vehicles to intelligent agents in virtual environments. As research in this area continues to advance, we can expect to see even more sophisticated and capable AI agents that can reason, plan, and act in complex environments.\n\nCompression\n\nPost-training quantization is a technique used to reduce the space requirements of large language models (LLMs) by adjusting the precision of the model's parameters. In this approach, the parameters of the LLM are converted from a higher precision format (such as 32-bit floating point) to a lower precision format (such as 8-bit integer or 16-bit floating point). This reduces the memory required to store the model, making it easier to deploy on devices with limited resources.\n\nOne approach to post-training quantization is to use layer-specific codebooks, where each layer of the LLM has its own set of quantization codes. This allows the model to maintain a high level of accuracy while reducing the precision of the parameters. Another approach is to use a single shared codebook for all layers, which can further reduce the memory requirements of the model.\n\nOutlier-aware post-training quantization is a technique that is particularly useful for LLMs, which often contain a small number of outliers with very large weights. These outliers can cause the quantization process to produce significant errors in the model's output. To address this issue, outlier-aware post-training quantization uses statistical methods to identify and handle these outliers separately from the rest of the model parameters. This allows the quantization process to maintain a high level of accuracy while reducing the precision of the majority of the model's parameters.\n\nOverall, post-training quantization is an important technique for reducing the space requirements of LLMs while maintaining their accuracy and performance. By adjusting the precision of the model's parameters, post-training quantization enables LLMs to be deployed on a wider range of devices and applications, making them more accessible and practical for a variety of use cases.\n\nMultimodality\n\nMultimodality refers to the integration of different types of inputs and outputs in large language models (LLMs). While traditional LLMs are primarily focused on processing and generating text, multimodal LLMs can handle a wider range of modalities, such as images, audio, and video. This enables the models to perform a broader range of tasks, including image captioning, speech recognition, and video analysis.\n\nOne example of a multimodal LLM is PaLM-E, which is a large language model that has been trained to process both text and images. PaLM-E is able to generate descriptive text based on images and can also answer questions about the contents of an image. This makes it useful for a variety of applications, such as image analysis and content moderation.\n\nAnother example of a multimodal LLM is DeepSeek-VL, which is a vision-language model that has been trained to perform a wide range of tasks involving both text and images. DeepSeek-VL is able to generate captions for images, answer questions about the contents of an image, and even perform object detection and segmentation.\n\nOverall, the development of multimodal LLMs represents a significant advancement in the field of natural language processing. By enabling the models to handle a wider range of modalities, multimodal LLMs can be used to solve a broader range of problems and are likely to have a significant impact on a variety of industries and applications.\n\nReasoning\n\nReasoning models are a type of large language model (LLM) that are specifically designed to perform complex reasoning tasks. Unlike traditional LLMs, which are primarily focused on generating text based on patterns learned from training data, reasoning models are able to perform tasks that require a deeper understanding of the underlying concepts and relationships in the data.\n\nOne of the key features of reasoning models is their ability to reason over multiple steps. This means that they are able to take into account the context and relationships between different pieces of information, and use this information to generate accurate and contextually appropriate responses. This is particularly important for tasks that require a deep understanding of the data, such as question answering, machine translation, and natural language inference.\n\nReasoning models are typically trained on large datasets that contain a wide range of different types of information. This allows them to learn a broad range of concepts and relationships, which enables them to perform reasoning tasks across a variety of domains and contexts.\n\nOne of the main advantages of reasoning models is their ability to handle complex tasks that require a deep understanding of the data. This makes them well-suited for a wide range of applications, including natural language understanding, knowledge graph construction, and automated reasoning.\n\nHowever, reasoning models can also be more computationally intensive than traditional LLMs, which can make them more difficult to train and deploy. As a result, there is ongoing research into developing more efficient and scalable approaches to building reasoning models.\n\nProperties\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) are a type of artificial intelligence (AI) system that are designed to understand and generate human-like text. Some of the key properties of LLMs include:\n\n* Human-like text generation: LLMs are able to generate text that is similar in style and content to human-written text. This makes them useful for a wide range of applications, such as chatbots, virtual assistants, and content generation.\n* Ability to learn from data: LLMs are trained on large datasets of text, which allows them to learn patterns and structures in language. This enables them to generate text that is coherent, contextually appropriate, and grammatically correct.\n* Ability to handle complex tasks: LLMs are able to handle a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as text classification, named entity recognition, and sentiment analysis. They are also able to handle more complex tasks, such as question answering and language translation.\n* Scalability: LLMs can be scaled up to handle large amounts of text data and can be run on a variety of hardware, including CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs.\n* Transferability: LLMs can be fine-tuned for specific tasks or domains, which allows them to be adapted for use in a wide range of applications.\n\nThese properties make LLMs a powerful tool for a wide range of applications, and they are likely to play an increasingly important role in the field of NLP in the coming years.\n\nScaling laws\n\nScaling laws are mathematical relationships that describe how the performance of a system scales with changes in its size or complexity. In the context of large language models (LLMs), scaling laws can be used to predict the performance of a model based on its size and the amount of training data used to build it.\n\nOne example of a scaling law for LLMs is the \"Chinchilla scaling\" law, which predicts the performance of a model based on the number of parameters it contains and the amount of training data used to build it. According to this law, doubling the size of a model while doubling the amount of training data used to build it will result in a roughly 60% improvement in performance.\n\nAnother example of a scaling law for LLMs is the \"scaling exponent\" law, which predicts the relationship between the size of a model and the amount of training data needed to build it. According to this law, the amount of training data needed to build a model scales with the square root of the number of parameters in the model.\n\nScaling laws are useful for predicting the performance of LLMs and for guiding the design of new models. By understanding the relationships between model size, training data, and performance, researchers can develop more efficient and effective LLMs that are better suited to a wide range of applications.\n\nEmergent abilities\n\nEmergent abilities refer to the unexpected and unintended capabilities that emerge in large language models (LLMs) as a result of their training process. These abilities are not explicitly programmed into the models, but instead arise as a result of the patterns and structures learned from the training data.\n\nOne example of an emergent ability in LLMs is their ability to perform tasks that go beyond their original training objectives. For example, LLMs that are trained on a large corpus of text data may also acquire the ability to perform tasks such as text generation, question answering, and language translation, even though these tasks were not part of their original training objectives.\n\nAnother example of an emergent ability in LLMs is their ability to exhibit creative and novel behaviors. LLMs may generate text that is creative, humorous, or even poetic, even though these qualities were not part of their original training objectives. This is possible because LLMs are able to learn patterns and structures in the training data that go beyond the explicit training objectives, allowing them to generate text that is novel and creative.\n\nEmergent abilities in LLMs are a double-edged sword. On the one hand, they can lead to unexpected and exciting new capabilities that were not anticipated by the model developers. On the other hand, they can also lead to unexpected and unintended behaviors that may be difficult to control or predict. As a result, researchers are actively studying emergent abilities in LLMs to better understand their nature and implications.\n\nInterpretation\n\nInterpretability is an important property of large language models (LLMs) that refers to the ability to understand how the model makes decisions and generates outputs. LLMs are often considered \"black boxes\" because they are highly complex and difficult to understand, making it challenging to interpret their outputs and decisions. However, interpretability is important for several reasons.\n\nFirst, interpretability can help to build trust in LLMs by allowing users to understand how the model arrives at its conclusions. This can be particularly important in domains where the decisions made by LLMs can have significant impacts on people's lives, such as healthcare or finance.\n\nSecond, interpretability can help to identify and correct errors in LLMs. By understanding how the model makes decisions, researchers can identify the sources of errors and work to correct them.\n\nFinally, interpretability can help to improve the performance of LLMs by providing insights into how the model can be improved. By understanding the factors that influence the model's outputs, researchers can develop new techniques to improve its performance.\n\nThere are several techniques that can be used to improve the interpretability of LLMs. One approach is to use visualization techniques to show how the model processes information and generates outputs. Another approach is to use statistical methods to identify the most important features and inputs that influence the model's decisions.\n\nOverall, interpretability is an important property of LLMs that can help to build trust, identify and correct errors, and improve the performance of the models. As LLMs become more widely used, it will be important to continue to develop techniques to improve their interpretability.\n\nStudying a replacement model\n\nTranscoders are a type of large language model (LLM) that are used to replace other LLMs. Transcoders are trained to map the output of one LLM to the input of another LLM, effectively translating the output of one model into a format that can be used by another. This allows transcoders to be used as a replacement for the original LLM, without the need to retrain the original model.\n\nOne study found that transcoders can be used to replace LLMs in a wide range of tasks, including text generation, question answering, and language translation. The study found that transcoders are able to achieve similar or better performance than the original LLMs, while requiring significantly fewer parameters and computational resources.\n\nAnother study found that transcoders can be used to improve the performance of LLMs in certain tasks. In this study, the researchers used a transcoder to replace the decoder of a LLM, resulting in a significant improvement in the model's ability to generate coherent and contextually appropriate text.\n\nOverall, transcoders offer a promising approach for replacing LLMs in a wide range of tasks. By allowing researchers to replace LLMs with smaller, more efficient models, transcoders have the potential to significantly reduce the computational cost of using LLMs.\n\nExplainability\n\nExplainability is an important aspect of large language models (LLMs) that refers to the ability of the model to provide explanations for its outputs and decisions. Explainability is important for several reasons. First, it helps to build trust in LLMs by allowing users to understand how the model arrived at its conclusions. Second, it can help to identify and correct errors in the model. Finally, it can help to improve the performance of the model by providing insights into how it can be improved.\n\nThere are several techniques that can be used to improve the explainability of LLMs. One approach is to use visualization techniques to show how the model processes information and generates outputs. Another approach is to use statistical methods to identify the most important features and inputs that influence the model's decisions.\n\nOverall, explainability is an important aspect of LLMs that can help to build trust, identify and correct errors, and improve the performance of the models. As LLMs become more widely used, it will be important to continue to develop techniques to improve their explainability.\n\nUnderstanding and intelligence\n\nThe question of whether large language models (LLMs) possess understanding and intelligence is a topic of ongoing debate in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). While LLMs have demonstrated impressive capabilities in tasks such as language translation, text generation, and question answering, it is unclear whether these capabilities are the result of genuine understanding or simply the result of pattern recognition and statistical analysis.\n\nOne argument against the idea that LLMs possess understanding is that they rely heavily on statistical analysis and pattern matching to generate outputs. This means that they may not actually understand the meaning or context of the input text, but instead are simply reproducing patterns learned during training. Additionally, LLMs have been shown to produce incorrect or nonsensical outputs in certain situations, suggesting that they lack a true understanding of the input text.\n\nOn the other hand, proponents of the idea that LLMs possess understanding argue that their ability to generate contextually appropriate outputs suggests that they do have some level of understanding. Furthermore, recent research has shown that LLMs can demonstrate a degree of reasoning and problem-solving ability, which is often associated with intelligence.\n\nOverall, the question of whether LLMs possess understanding and intelligence is complex and multifaceted. While LLMs have demonstrated impressive capabilities, it is unclear whether these capabilities are the result of genuine understanding or simply the result of pattern recognition and statistical analysis. As research in this area continues to evolve, it will be important to further investigate the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in order to better understand their potential applications and limitations.\n\nEvaluation\n\nThe evaluation of large language models (LLMs) is an important task in natural language processing (NLP) that involves assessing the performance of LLMs on a variety of tasks and domains. The evaluation of LLMs is important because it helps to ensure that the models are accurate, reliable, and useful for a wide range of applications.\n\nThere are several methods for evaluating LLMs, including task-specific metrics and benchmarks. Task-specific metrics are designed to evaluate the performance of LLMs on a specific task, such as text classification or machine translation. Benchmarks are larger collections of tasks that are used to evaluate the overall performance of LLMs across a range of different tasks and domains.\n\nOne of the challenges in evaluating LLMs is the lack of standardized evaluation protocols. This makes it difficult to compare the performance of different LLMs and to determine which models are best suited for a particular task or domain.\n\nAnother challenge in evaluating LLMs is the need for large amounts of labeled data. Many of the commonly used evaluation benchmarks are based on manually labeled data, which can be expensive and time-consuming to collect.\n\nDespite these challenges, the evaluation of LLMs is an important task in NLP. By developing and using standardized evaluation protocols and benchmarks, researchers can ensure that LLMs are accurate, reliable, and useful for a wide range of applications.\n\nPerplexity\n\nPerplexity is a commonly used metric for evaluating the performance of large language models (LLMs) on language modeling tasks. It measures the model's ability to predict the next word in a sequence of text, and is calculated by taking the inverse probability of the actual next word occurring, averaged over all words in the test dataset. A lower perplexity score indicates better performance, as it means the model is better able to predict the next word in a sequence.\n\nWhen using perplexity on test datasets, it is important to note that the scores can be influenced by the distribution of words in the data. For example, if the test dataset contains a lot of rare words, the perplexity score may be higher than if the dataset contained more common words. Additionally, perplexity does not take into account the semantic meaning of the text, only the statistical likelihood of the words occurring together. As a result, it is important to use perplexity in conjunction with other evaluation metrics to get a full picture of a model's performance.\n\nBPW, BPC, and BPT\n\nEntropy is a measure of uncertainty or randomness in a probability distribution. In the context of language models, entropy can be used to quantify the complexity of a language model's output distribution. The entropy of a language model's output distribution is inversely proportional to the model's confidence in its predictions. A language model with high entropy will produce output distributions that are more spread out and less confident, while a language model with low entropy will produce output distributions that are more concentrated and more confident.\n\nBits per word (BPW), bits per character (BPC), and bits per token (BPT) are all measures of the information density of a language model's output distribution. These measures are used to quantify the amount of information that a language model is able to compress into its output. A language model with low BPW, BPC, or BPT is said to have high information density, while a language model with high BPW, BPC, or BPT is said to have low information density.\n\nCross-entropy is a loss function that is commonly used to evaluate the performance of language models. It measures the difference between the predicted output distribution of a language model and the true output distribution of the data. Cross-entropy is used to optimize the parameters of a language model during training, and is a commonly used metric for comparing the performance of different language models.\n\nTask-specific datasets and benchmarks\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) are evaluated on a wide range of task-specific datasets and benchmarks to assess their performance on different NLP tasks. These tasks include tasks such as text classification, named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, and sentiment analysis.\n\nText classification is a task where the goal is to classify a given piece of text into one or more predefined categories. Named entity recognition is a task where the goal is to identify and classify named entities, such as people, organizations, and locations, in a given text. Part-of-speech tagging is a task where the goal is to assign a part of speech, such as noun or verb, to each word in a given text. Dependency parsing is a task where the goal is to identify the syntactic relationships between words in a given text. Sentiment analysis is a task where the goal is to determine the sentiment or emotional tone of a given piece of text.\n\nThere are many different datasets and benchmarks that are used to evaluate LLMs on these tasks. Some popular datasets include the Stanford Sentiment Treebank, the CoNLL-2003 Named Entity Recognition dataset, and the Penn Treebank Part-of-Speech Tagging dataset. There are also many different benchmarks that are used to evaluate LLMs on these tasks, such as the GLUE benchmark, the SuperGLUE benchmark, and the XNLI benchmark.\n\nAdversarially constructed evaluations\n\nThe creation of evaluation benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) presents several challenges. One major challenge is the need to construct benchmarks that are robust to potential attacks or manipulations by malicious actors. This is because LLMs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where carefully crafted inputs can cause the model to produce incorrect or misleading outputs. To address this challenge, researchers have developed a range of techniques for constructing adversarially robust evaluation benchmarks, including methods for generating adversarial examples and evaluating model robustness.\n\nAnother challenge in constructing evaluation benchmarks for LLMs is the need to ensure that the benchmarks are effective at detecting and measuring a wide range of potential weaknesses or biases in the models. This is because LLMs can exhibit a wide range of different types of errors or limitations, and it is important to be able to evaluate the models across a broad spectrum of potential failure modes. To address this challenge, researchers have developed a range of evaluation metrics and benchmarks that are designed to assess different aspects of LLM performance, such as factual accuracy, commonsense reasoning, and social awareness.\n\nA third challenge in constructing evaluation benchmarks for LLMs is the need to ensure that the benchmarks are representative of the diverse range of real-world applications and use cases for these models. This is because LLMs are used in a wide range of different domains and contexts, and it is important to ensure that the evaluation benchmarks reflect the diversity of these applications. To address this challenge, researchers have developed evaluation benchmarks that cover a broad range of application domains, such as healthcare, finance, and education.\n\nOverall, the construction of evaluation benchmarks for LLMs is a complex and challenging task, requiring careful consideration of a wide range of factors and trade-offs. Nevertheless, effective evaluation benchmarks are essential for advancing the development and deployment of LLMs, and ongoing research in this area is critical for ensuring that LLMs are safe, reliable, and effective in a wide range of real-world applications.\n\nLimitations of LLM benchmarks\n\nBenchmark saturation is a phenomenon that occurs when large language models (LLMs) begin to perform at near-perfect levels on established evaluation benchmarks. This can make it increasingly difficult to accurately measure and compare the performance of different LLMs, as they may all achieve similar levels of accuracy on the same benchmarks. As a result, researchers are increasingly looking for new ways to evaluate the capabilities of LLMs and to identify areas where further improvement is possible.\n\nOne approach to overcoming benchmark saturation is to develop new benchmarks that are more challenging and that can better capture the full range of capabilities of LLMs. These new benchmarks may include tasks that are more difficult or that require different types of reasoning, such as commonsense reasoning or mathematical reasoning. Another approach is to develop benchmarks that are more diverse and that cover a wider range of real-world scenarios and use cases. This can help to ensure that LLMs are evaluated on a broad range of tasks and that their strengths and weaknesses are properly identified.\n\nOverall, benchmark saturation is a significant challenge for the evaluation of LLMs, but it is also an opportunity to develop new and more challenging benchmarks that can better capture the full range of capabilities of these models. By continuing to push the boundaries of what is possible with LLMs, researchers can help to ensure that these models remain at the forefront of natural language processing research and development.\n\nWider impact\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have the potential to bring about significant changes across a wide range of industries and fields. Some of the potential benefits of LLMs include improved automation and efficiency in tasks such as customer service and content generation, as well as the ability to analyze and interpret large amounts of data more quickly and accurately than humans.\n\nHowever, LLMs also have the potential to disrupt traditional job roles and industries, particularly those that involve repetitive or routine tasks. For example, LLMs could potentially replace customer service representatives or data entry workers in some cases. This could have significant implications for employment and income inequality, as workers in these industries may need to acquire new skills or find alternative forms of employment.\n\nIn addition to their potential impact on employment, LLMs also have the potential to reshape cultural norms and communication patterns. As LLMs become more advanced and capable of generating human-like text, they may become more widely used in areas such as creative writing and content creation. This could have implications for the way that stories and ideas are shared and consumed, as well as for the way that intellectual property rights are enforced.\n\nOverall, the development and deployment of LLMs has the potential to bring about significant changes across a wide range of industries and fields. While these changes may have both positive and negative impacts, it is important for policymakers, industry leaders, and individuals to be aware of the potential implications of LLMs and to take steps to mitigate any negative effects.\n\nMemorization and copyright\n\nOne concern with large language models (LLMs) is that they may memorize and reproduce large portions of the internet during training, potentially leading to copyright violations. Because LLMs are trained on vast amounts of text data, they may inadvertently incorporate copyrighted material into their training data, which could then be reproduced in their outputs. This could potentially lead to copyright infringement if the LLM's outputs are used without permission from the copyright holders.\n\nTo mitigate this risk, researchers have proposed a number of approaches for managing the copyright implications of LLMs. One approach is to use techniques such as watermarking or fingerprinting to identify and remove copyrighted material from the training data. Another approach is to use techniques such as differential privacy or homomorphic encryption to protect the confidentiality of the training data while still allowing the LLM to learn from it.\n\nSecurity\n\nMisinformation\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have the potential to generate realistic and convincing text that can be used to spread misinformation. This is because LLMs are trained on large amounts of text data, which can include biased or inaccurate information. As a result, LLMs may produce text that appears to be truthful but is actually false or misleading.\n\nMisinformation generated by LLMs can be particularly dangerous because it can be difficult to detect and verify. Unlike traditional sources of misinformation, which may be identifiable as propaganda or fake news, text generated by LLMs can appear to be credible and authoritative. This makes it more likely to be believed and acted upon by readers.\n\nTo address the risk of misinformation from LLMs, researchers are developing techniques for detecting and fact-checking text generated by these models. These techniques may involve analyzing the language and style of the text, comparing it to known facts or sources, or using other methods to verify its accuracy. By developing these techniques, researchers hope to help mitigate the risk of misinformation from LLMs and to promote more accurate and reliable information.\n\nMisuse\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) can be used for a wide range of applications, from generating creative content to assisting with research and development. However, there is a risk that LLMs could be misused for malicious purposes, such as generating fake news or propaganda, or even being used to create malicious code or malware.\n\nOne way that LLMs could be misused is through the generation of fake news or propaganda. Because LLMs are trained on large amounts of text data, they can be used to generate realistic and convincing text that may be used to spread false or misleading information. This could be particularly dangerous in the context of political campaigns or other high-stakes situations, where false information could have significant impacts.\n\nAnother way that LLMs could be misused is through the generation of malicious code or malware. Because LLMs are able to generate code that appears to be written by a human, they could potentially be used to create malware or other malicious software that is more difficult to detect and defend against.\n\nTo mitigate the risk of misuse, it is important to develop robust safeguards and controls for the use of LLMs. This may involve developing techniques for detecting and preventing the generation of malicious code or other harmful content, as well as implementing policies and procedures to ensure that LLMs are used responsibly and ethically.\n\nSleeper agents\n\nA \"sleeper agent\" is a person who is recruited by a spy agency and given instructions to carry out a mission at a later date. In the context of large language models (LLMs), the term \"sleeper agent\" has been used to describe a situation where an LLM is trained on data that contains biased or misleading information, and then used to generate text that reflects those biases or contains misinformation. This text could then be used to influence public opinion or spread propaganda, potentially without the user of the LLM being aware of the biases or inaccuracies in the generated text.\n\nOne potential way that LLMs could be used as sleeper agents is through the generation of fake news or propaganda. Because LLMs are trained on large amounts of text data, they can be used to generate realistic and convincing text that may be used to spread false or misleading information. This could be particularly dangerous in the context of political campaigns or other high-stakes situations, where false information could have significant impacts.\n\nAnother way that LLMs could be used as sleeper agents is through the generation of biased or misleading content. Because LLMs are trained on data that may contain biases or inaccuracies, they could potentially be used to generate text that reflects those biases or contains misinformation. This text could then be used to influence public opinion or spread propaganda, potentially without the user of the LLM being aware of the biases or inaccuracies in the generated text.\n\nTo mitigate the risk of LLMs being used as sleeper agents, it is important to develop robust safeguards and controls for the use of LLMs. This may involve developing techniques for detecting and preventing the generation of biased or misleading content, as well as implementing policies and procedures to ensure that LLMs are used responsibly and ethically.\n\nAlgorithmic bias\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have the potential to exhibit algorithmic bias, which can occur when the models produce different outputs for different groups of people based on characteristics such as race, gender, or age. This can happen if the training data used to build the LLM contains biases or if the LLM is not trained to handle certain types of input.\n\nOne way that LLMs can exhibit algorithmic bias is through the generation of text that reflects biases in the training data. For example, if the training data used to build an LLM contains a disproportionate number of examples of a particular group of people, the LLM may produce outputs that reflect those biases. This can lead to the generation of text that is biased against certain groups of people or that reinforces harmful stereotypes.\n\nAnother way that LLMs can exhibit algorithmic bias is through the generation of text that is not appropriate for certain groups of people. For example, an LLM may produce outputs that are offensive or inappropriate for certain groups of people, such as children or people with disabilities. This can lead to the generation of text that is harmful or offensive to certain groups of people.\n\nTo mitigate the risk of algorithmic bias in LLMs, it is important to develop techniques for identifying and mitigating biases in the training data and for testing the LLMs on a wide range of input scenarios. This may involve using techniques such as fairness testing or adversarial testing to identify potential sources of bias and to develop strategies for mitigating those biases.\n\nStereotyping\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have the potential to exhibit stereotypical behavior, which can occur when the models produce outputs that reflect harmful or inaccurate stereotypes about certain groups of people. This can happen if the training data used to build the LLM contains stereotypes or if the LLM is not trained to handle certain types of input.\n\nOne way that LLMs can exhibit stereotypical behavior is through the generation of text that reflects harmful stereotypes about certain groups of people. For example, an LLM may produce outputs that reinforce harmful stereotypes about women, minorities, or other groups of people. This can lead to the generation of text that is offensive or discriminatory.\n\nAnother way that LLMs can exhibit stereotypical behavior is through the generation of text that is not appropriate for certain groups of people. For example, an LLM may produce outputs that are offensive or inappropriate for certain groups of people, such as children or people with disabilities. This can lead to the generation of text that is harmful or offensive to certain groups of people.\n\nTo mitigate the risk of stereotypical behavior in LLMs, it is important to develop techniques for identifying and mitigating harmful stereotypes in the training data and for testing the LLMs on a wide range of input scenarios. This may involve using techniques such as fairness testing or adversarial testing to identify potential sources of bias and to develop strategies for mitigating those biases.\n\nSelection bias\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) may exhibit selection bias, which can occur when the model is more likely to select certain types of responses over others. This can lead to the model producing outputs that are biased towards certain types of responses, which can in turn lead to incorrect or misleading outputs.\n\nOne way that LLMs can exhibit selection bias is through the generation of text that reflects the biases of the training data. For example, if the training data used to build the LLM contains a disproportionate number of examples of a particular type of response, the LLM may be more likely to generate outputs that reflect those biases. This can lead to the generation of text that is biased towards certain types of responses.\n\nAnother way that LLMs can exhibit selection bias is through the generation of text that is not appropriate for certain types of responses. For example, an LLM may be more likely to generate outputs that are offensive or inappropriate for certain types of responses, such as responses that are intended to be educational or informative. This can lead to the generation of text that is harmful or misleading.\n\nTo mitigate the risk of selection bias in LLMs, it is important to develop techniques for identifying and mitigating biases in the training data and for testing the LLMs on a wide range of input scenarios. This may involve using techniques such as fairness testing or adversarial testing to identify potential sources of bias and to develop strategies for mitigating those biases.\n\nPolitical bias\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) can exhibit political bias, which can occur when the models produce outputs that reflect the political leanings of the training data. This can happen if the training data used to build the LLM contains biased or imbalanced information, or if the LLM is not trained to handle certain types of input.\n\nOne way that LLMs can exhibit political bias is through the generation of text that reflects the biases of the training data. For example, if the training data used to build the LLM contains a disproportionate number of examples of a particular political viewpoint, the LLM may be more likely to generate outputs that reflect those biases. This can lead to the generation of text that is biased towards certain political viewpoints.\n\nAnother way that LLMs can exhibit political bias is through the generation of text that is not appropriate for certain political viewpoints. For example, an LLM may be more likely to generate outputs that are offensive or inappropriate for certain political viewpoints, such as responses that are intended to be educational or informative. This can lead to the generation of text that is harmful or misleading.\n\nTo mitigate the risk of political bias in LLMs, it is important to develop techniques for identifying and mitigating biases in the training data and for testing the LLMs on a wide range of input scenarios. This may involve using techniques such as fairness testing or adversarial testing to identify potential sources of bias and to develop strategies for mitigating those biases.\n\nEnergy demands\n\nAs large language models (LLMs) continue to grow in size and complexity, their energy demands are also increasing. This is due in part to the large amounts of electricity required to train these models, as well as the energy required to run them once they are deployed.\n\nTo address the energy demands of LLMs, researchers are exploring a range of solutions, including more energy-efficient hardware, new algorithms and architectures, and techniques for optimizing the training and deployment of these models. For example, some researchers are exploring the use of quantum computing to accelerate the training of LLMs, while others are exploring new neural network architectures that are more energy-efficient.\n\nIn addition to these technical solutions, there is also a growing emphasis on the environmental impact of LLMs and the need to develop more sustainable approaches to building and deploying these models. This includes efforts to reduce the carbon footprint of LLMs and to explore alternative energy sources, such as solar and wind power, to power these models.\n\nOverall, the energy demands of LLMs are a significant challenge that must be addressed in order to ensure the sustainability and viability of these models in the long term.\n\nSee also\n\n* Foundation model\n* Language model\n* Benchmark\n* Chatbot\n\nReferences\n\n* \u2191\n\nFurther reading\n\n* Chen, H.; Dai, Z. & Le, Q.

The embedding is used in text analysis. Typically, the representation is a real-valued vector that encodes the meaning of the word in such a way that the words that are closer in the vector space are expected to be similar in meaning. Word embeddings can be obtained using language modeling and feature learning techniques, where words or phrases from the vocabulary are mapped to vectors of real numbers.\nMethods to generate this mapping include neural networks, dimensionality reduction on the word co-occurrence matrix, probabilistic models, explainable knowledge base method, and explicit representation in terms of the context in which words appear.\nWord and phrase embeddings, when used as the underlying input representation, have been shown to boost the performance in NLP tasks such as syntactic parsing and sentiment analysis.Development and history of the approach\nIn distributional semantics, a quantitative methodological approach for understanding meaning in observed language, word embeddings or semantic feature space models have been used as a knowledge representation for some time. Such models aim to quantify and categorize semantic similarities between linguistic items based on their distributional properties in large samples of language data.  The underlying idea that \"a word is characterized by the company it keeps\" was proposed in a 1957 article by John Rupert Firth, but also has roots in the contemporaneous work on search systems and in cognitive psychology.\nThe notion of a semantic space with lexical items (words or multi-word terms) represented as vectors or embeddings is based on the computational challenges of capturing distributional characteristics and using them for practical application to measure similarity between words, phrases, or entire documents. The first generation of semantic space models is the vector space model for information retrieval. Such vector space models for words and their distributional data implemented in their simplest form results in a very sparse vector space of high dimensionality (cf. curse of dimensionality). Reducing the number of dimensions using linear algebraic methods such as singular value decomposition then led to the introduction of latent semantic analysis in the late 1980s and the random indexing approach for collecting word co-occurrence contexts. In 2000, Bengio et al. provided in a series of papers titled \"Neural probabilistic language models\" to reduce the high dimensionality of word representations in contexts by \"learning a distributed representation for words\".\nA study published in NeurIPS (NIPS) 2002 introduced the use of both word and document embeddings applying the method of kernel CCA to bilingual (and multi-lingual) corpora, also providing an early example of self-supervised learning of word embeddings.\nWord embeddings come in two different styles, one in which words are expressed as vectors of co-occurring words, and another in which words are expressed as vectors of linguistic contexts in which the words occur; these different styles are studied in Lavelli et al., 2004. Roweis and Saul published in Science how to use \"locally linear embedding\" (LLE) to discover representations of high dimensional data structures. Most new word embedding techniques after about 2005 rely on a neural network architecture instead of more probabilistic and algebraic models, after foundational work done by Yoshua Bengio and colleagues.\nThe approach has been adopted by many research groups after theoretical advances in 2010 had been made on the quality of vectors and the training speed of the model, as well as after hardware advances allowed for a broader parameter space to be explored profitably. In 2013, a team at Google led by Tomas Mikolov created word2vec, a word embedding toolkit that can train vector space models faster than previous approaches. The word2vec approach has been widely used in experimentation and was instrumental in raising interest for word embeddings as a technology, moving the research strand out of specialised research into broader experimentation and eventually paving the way for practical application.Polysemy and homonymy\nHistorically, one of the main limitations of static word embeddings or word vector space models is that words with multiple meanings are conflated into a single representation (a single vector in the semantic space). In other words, polysemy and homonymy are not handled properly. For example, in the sentence \"The club I tried yesterday was great!\", it is not clear if the term club is related to the word sense of a club sandwich, clubhouse, golf club, or any other sense that club might have. The necessity to accommodate multiple meanings per word in different vectors (multi-sense embeddings) is the motivation for several contributions in NLP to split single-sense embeddings into multi-sense ones.\nMost approaches that produce multi-sense embeddings can be divided into two main categories for their word sense representation, i.e., unsupervised and knowledge-based. Based on word2vec skip-gram, Multi-Sense Skip-Gram (MSSG) performs word-sense discrimination and embedding simultaneously, improving its training time, while assuming a specific number of senses for each word. In the Non-Parametric Multi-Sense Skip-Gram (NP-MSSG) this number can vary depending on each word. Combining the prior knowledge of lexical databases (e.g., WordNet, ConceptNet, BabelNet), word embeddings and word sense disambiguation, Most Suitable Sense Annotation (MSSA) labels word-senses through an unsupervised and knowledge-based approach, considering a word's context in a pre-defined sliding window. Once the words are disambiguated, they can be used in a standard word embeddings technique, so multi-sense embeddings are produced. MSSA architecture allows the disambiguation and annotation process to be performed recurrently in a self-improving manner.\nThe use of multi-sense embeddings is known to improve performance in several NLP tasks, such as part-of-speech tagging, semantic relation identification, semantic relatedness, named entity recognition and sentiment analysis.\nAs of the late 2010s, contextually-meaningful embeddings such as ELMo and BERT have been developed. Unlike static word embeddings, these embeddings are at the token-level, in that each occurrence of a word has its own embedding. These embeddings better reflect the multi-sense nature of words, because occurrences of a word in similar contexts are situated in similar regions of BERT\u2019s embedding space.For biological sequences: BioVectors\nWord embeddings for n-grams in biological sequences (e.g. DNA, RNA, and Proteins) for bioinformatics applications have been proposed by Asgari and Mofrad. Named bio-vectors (BioVec) to refer to biological sequences in general with protein-vectors (ProtVec) for proteins (amino-acid sequences) and gene-vectors (GeneVec) for gene sequences, this representation can be widely used in applications of deep learning in proteomics and genomics. The results presented by Asgari and Mofrad suggest that BioVectors can characterize biological sequences in terms of biochemical and biophysical interpretations of the underlying patterns.Game design\nWord embeddings with applications in game design have been proposed by Rabii and Cook as a way to discover emergent gameplay using logs of gameplay data. The process requires transcribing actions that occur during a game within a formal language and then using the resulting text to create word embeddings. The results presented by Rabii and Cook suggest that the resulting vectors can capture expert knowledge about games like chess that are not explicitly stated in the game's rules.Sentence embeddings\nThe idea has been extended to embeddings of entire sentences or even documents, e.g. in the form of the thought vectors concept. In 2015, some researchers suggested \"skip-thought vectors\" as a means to improve the quality of machine translation. A more recent and popular approach for representing sentences is Sentence-BERT, or SentenceTransformers, which modifies pre-trained BERT with the use of siamese and triplet network structures.Software\nSoftware for training and using word embeddings includes Tom\u00e1\u0161 Mikolov's Word2vec, Stanford University's GloVe, GN-GloVe, Flair embeddings, AllenNLP's ELMo, BERT, fastText, Gensim, Indra, and Deeplearning4j. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and T-Distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding (t-SNE) are both used to reduce the dimensionality of word vector spaces and visualize word embeddings and clusters.Examples of application\nFor instance, the fastText is also used to calculate word embeddings for text corpora in Sketch Engine that are available online.Ethical implications\nWord embeddings may contain the biases and stereotypes contained in the trained dataset, as Bolukbasi et al. points out in the 2016 paper \u201cMan is to Computer Programmer as Woman is to Homemaker? Debiasing Word Embeddings\u201d that a publicly available (and popular) word2vec embedding trained on Google News texts (a commonly used data corpus), which consists of text written by professional journalists, still shows disproportionate word associations reflecting gender and racial biases when extracting word analogies. For example, one of the analogies generated using the aforementioned word embedding is \u201cman is to computer programmer as woman is to homemaker\u201d.\nResearch done by Jieyu Zhou et al. shows that the applications of these trained word embeddings without careful oversight likely perpetuates existing bias in society, which is introduced through unaltered training data. Furthermore, word embeddings can even amplify these biases .See also\nEmbedding (machine learning)\nBrown clustering\nDistributional\u2013relational database\n\n\n== References ==", "result": "# Introduction\n\nWord embeddings are low-dimensional vector representations of words or phrases in a language. They are intended to capture the contextual meanings of words, and thus can be considered as a method of representing words in a continuous vector space based on distributional semantics. Word embeddings are broadly used in natural language processing (NLP) because they capture semantic relationships between words and improve the performance of various NLP tasks.\n\nWord embeddings are usually generated by topic modeling, neural network-based models, or a combination of both. They represent words as real-valued vectors of fixed size, which can then be input into a machine learning algorithm.\n\n# Development and history of the approach\n\nThe earliest models of semantic space were based on the simple co-occurrence of words within a given window in a corpus. These models, such as Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), are based on singular value decomposition (SVD) of a term-document matrix derived from a corpus. LSA was introduced in 1988, and has been used in a variety of applications, including information retrieval, document classification, and clustering. A similar model is Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). LSA and LDA are algebraic methods of constructing semantic space without any learning component.\n\nA different approach to word embeddings was proposed in 2000 with the introduction of the Neural Probabilistic Language Model (NPLM), which represents words as distributed representations or embeddings. NPLM is a neural network trained to predict a word from its context. NPLM uses a standard feed-forward neural network to predict the target word from several surrounding input words. In contrast to previous approaches, NPLM learns word embeddings through neural network weights. This allows NPLM to learn more complex representations of words, but at the cost of requiring large amounts of data and computational resources. NPLM was later superseded by more advanced neural network architectures such as the recurrent neural network (RNN) and the convolutional neural network (CNN).\n\nSkip-gram and continuous bag-of-words (CBOW) are two popular neural network architectures that use a single hidden layer to map word embeddings in a lower-dimensional space. Both architectures were introduced in 2013 by Tomas Mikolov et al., and are part of the Word2Vec package. Skip-gram predicts a context window of words given a target word, while CBOW predicts a target word given a context window. Skip-gram is computationally more intensive than CBOW, but it scales better to small data sets. Word2Vec models are generally superior to earlier approaches in terms of both accuracy and robustness.\n\nSince 2013, there have been several improvements in the quality of word embeddings. One significant advancement is multi-sense embeddings, which aim to capture multiple senses of words and their contextual usage. One example is the GloVe model, which is based on counting word co-occurrences, but uses a weighted least squares optimization scheme instead of SVD. Another example is the Hierarchical Clustering of Contextualized Embeddings (HACE) model, which uses hierarchical clustering to group words with similar meanings together. HACE is able to capture both the syntactic and semantic properties of words, and has been shown to perform well in a variety of downstream tasks.\n\nAnother notable improvement is the use of neural networks to capture contextually meaningful representations of words. The ELMo model, introduced in 2018, uses a bidirectional LSTM to produce word embeddings that take into account the context in which a word appears. Similarly, the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model, introduced in 2018, uses a transformer architecture to produce context-sensitive word embeddings. These models have achieved state-of-the-art results in many NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and question answering.\n\nOverall, the development of word embeddings has been a major advance in the field of NLP. By using neural networks and other advanced techniques, researchers have been able to create word embeddings that capture the meaning and context of words in a way that was not possible with earlier methods. As NLP continues to evolve, it is likely that word embeddings will play an increasingly important role in a wide range of applications.\n\n# Polysemy and homonymy\n\nStatic word embeddings are limited in their ability to handle polysemous words (words with many related meanings) and homonymous words (words that share the same spelling and pronunciation but have distinct meanings). While traditional word embeddings represent each word by a single vector, this one-size-fits-all approach struggles to capture the nuances associated with polysemous words, where a single word may have multiple related meanings depending on the context in which it is used. Homonymous words further complicate the problem since they require the model to disambiguate the meaning based on the context. As a result, static word embeddings often fail to accurately represent the full range of meanings associated with polysemous and homonymous words.\n\nTo address this limitation, multi-sense embeddings have been developed to provide a more nuanced representation of words in context. Unlike static embeddings, which assign a single vector to each word, multi-sense embeddings use a collection of vectors to represent the various senses of a word. Each vector corresponds to a specific sense of the word and is learned based on the context in which it appears. For example, the word \"bank\" has several distinct meanings, including a financial institution, the land alongside a river, and a place where something is stored. Multi-sense embeddings would use separate vectors to represent each of these distinct senses, allowing the model to disambiguate the intended meaning based on the context in which the word appears.\n\nOne example of a multi-sense embedding model is ELMo (Embeddings from Language Models), which uses a bidirectional LSTM to generate word embeddings that take into account the context in which a word appears. ELMo generates three different embeddings for each word, corresponding to its past, present, and future contexts. These embeddings are then combined to produce a final representation that captures the word's meaning in context. Another example is BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), which uses a transformer architecture to generate context-sensitive word embeddings. BERT is pre-trained on a large corpus of text using a masked language modeling objective, which encourages the model to learn rich contextual representations of words. These pre-trained embeddings can then be fine-tuned for a variety of downstream NLP tasks, such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and question answering.\n\nBy using a collection of vectors to represent the various senses of a word, multi-sense embeddings are able to capture the full range of meanings associated with polysemous and homonymous words. This allows them to better capture the nuances of language and improve the performance of NLP systems in handling these challenging cases.\n\n# For biological sequences: BioVectors\n\nWord embeddings, such as bio-vectors, prot-vectors, and gene-vectors, are numerical representations of biological sequences that capture the semantic relationships between different biological entities. These representations are derived from deep learning algorithms and are used to enhance bioinformatics applications by enabling the discovery of patterns and features that are not easily discernible through traditional sequence analysis methods. Bio-vectors are derived from DNA sequences, prot-vectors from protein sequences, and gene-vectors from gene expression data. They are particularly useful in identifying conserved regions, motifs, and functional elements within biological sequences. By encoding biological sequences as high-dimensional vectors, bio-vectors enable the application of machine learning techniques to problems in genomics, proteomics, and other areas of molecular biology. This has led to significant advances in our understanding of biological processes and the development of new tools for the analysis and interpretation of biological data.\n\n# Game design\n\nWord embeddings can be used in game design to uncover emergent gameplay and capture expert knowledge. Rabii and Cook propose a method to analyze the language used in video game walkthroughs to understand player behavior and emergent gameplay. By transcribing gameplay actions into a formal language, the authors demonstrate how word embeddings can capture the latent spaces of games and reveal underlying patterns in player behavior. This approach enables game designers to gain insights into how players interact with their games and identify opportunities for improving the player experience.\n\n# Sentence embeddings\n\nSentence embeddings are an extension of word embeddings that represent entire sentences as vectors. Two notable examples are skip-thought vectors, introduced in 2015, and Sentence-BERT (SBERT), introduced in 2019. Skip-thought vectors use a recurrent neural network (RNN) to generate embeddings for both preceding and following sentences in a paragraph, allowing the model to learn sentence representations that capture the semantic relationships between sentences. SBERT, on the other hand, uses a bidirectional transformer architecture to encode sentences and compute cosine similarities between their embeddings. These sentence embeddings have been successfully applied to various natural language processing tasks, including machine translation and paraphrase detection.\n\n# Software\n\nSoftware for training word embeddings include Gensim, Stanford CoreNLP, GenSim, GloVe, and FastText. The software can be used to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset and visualize the data in 2D or 3D space using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE). This visualization technique helps to explore the relationships between words or other textual units represented as embeddings.\n\n# Examples of application\n\nfastText is a tool for processing subwords in text, which is used in the Sketch Engine corpus browser to process corpora and provide word frequency information.\n\n# Ethical implications\n\nWord embeddings can reproduce and amplify biases present in the training data, including gender and racial biases. These biases can have significant ethical implications, particularly in applications where word embeddings are used to make decisions about individuals, such as in hiring or lending. To mitigate these risks, it is important to carefully evaluate the potential biases in the training data and to regularly monitor and audit the performance of word embeddings in order to identify and address any discriminatory outcomes.\n\n# See also\n\n* Semantic indexing\n* Semantic similarity\n* Sentiment analysis\n* Text mining\n* Topic model\n* Vector space model\n"}, {"instruction": "You are an AI editor writing a complete Wikipedia article that adheres to Wikipedia's content standards.

It learns to represent text as a sequence of vectors using self-supervised learning. It uses the encoder-only transformer architecture. BERT dramatically improved the state-of-the-art for large language models. As of 2020, BERT is a ubiquitous baseline in natural language processing (NLP) experiments. \nBERT is trained by masked token prediction and next sentence prediction. As a result of this training process, BERT learns contextual, latent representations of tokens in their context, similar to ELMo and GPT-2. It found applications for many natural language processing tasks, such as coreference resolution and polysemy resolution. It is an evolutionary step over ELMo, and spawned the study of \"BERTology\", which attempts to interpret what is learned by BERT.\nBERT was originally implemented in the English language at two model sizes, BERTBASE (110 million parameters) and BERTLARGE (340 million parameters). Both were trained on the Toronto BookCorpus (800M words) and English Wikipedia  (2,500M words). The weights were released on GitHub. On March 11, 2020, 24 smaller models were released, the smallest being BERTTINY with just 4 million parameters.Architecture\nBERT is an \"encoder-only\" transformer architecture. At a high level, BERT consists of 4 modules: \n\nTokenizer: This module converts a piece of English text into a sequence of integers (\"tokens\").\nEmbedding: This module converts the sequence of tokens into an array of real-valued vectors representing the tokens. It represents the conversion of discrete token types into a lower-dimensional Euclidean space.\nEncoder: a stack of Transformer blocks with self-attention, but without causal masking.\nTask head: This module converts the final representation vectors into one-hot encoded tokens again by producing a predicted probability distribution over the token types. It can be viewed as a simple decoder, decoding the latent representation into token types, or as an \"un-embedding layer\".\nThe task head is necessary for pre-training, but it is often unnecessary for so-called \"downstream tasks,\" such as question answering or sentiment classification. Instead, one removes the task head and replaces it with a newly initialized module suited for the task, and finetune the new module. The latent vector representation of the model is directly fed into this new module, allowing for sample-efficient transfer learning.Embedding\nThis section describes the embedding used by BERTBASE. The other one, BERTLARGE, is similar, just larger.\nThe tokenizer of BERT is WordPiece, which is a sub-word strategy like byte pair encoding. Its vocabulary size is 30,000, and any token not appearing in its vocabulary is replaced by [UNK] (\"unknown\"). \n\nThe first layer is the embedding layer, which contains three components: token type embeddings, position embeddings, and segment type embeddings. \n\nToken type: The token type is a standard embedding layer, translating a one-hot vector into a dense vector based on its token type.\nPosition: The position embeddings are based on a token's position in the sequence. BERT uses absolute position embeddings, where each position in sequence is mapped to a real-valued vector. Each dimension of the vector consists of a sinusoidal function that takes the position in the sequence as input.\nSegment type: Using a vocabulary of just 0 or 1, this embedding layer produces a dense vector based on whether the token belongs to the first or second text segment in that input. In other words, type-1 tokens are all tokens that appear after the [SEP] special token. All prior tokens are type-0.\nThe three embedding vectors are added together representing the initial token representation as a function of these three pieces of information. After embedding, the vector representation is normalized using a LayerNorm operation, outputting a 768-dimensional vector for each input token. After this, the representation vectors are passed forward through 12 Transformer encoder blocks, and are decoded back to 30,000-dimensional vocabulary space using a basic affine transformation layer.Architectural family\nThe encoder stack of BERT has 2 free parameters: \n  \n    \n      \n        L\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle L}\n  \n, the number of layers, and \n  \n    \n      \n        H\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle H}\n  \n, the hidden size. There are always \n  \n    \n      \n        H\n        \n          /\n        \n        64\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle H/64}\n  \n self-attention heads, and the feed-forward/filter size is always \n  \n    \n      \n        4\n        H\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 4H}\n  \n. By varying these two numbers, one obtains an entire family of BERT models.\nFor BERT\n\nthe feed-forward size and filter size are synonymous. Both of them denote the number of dimensions in the middle layer of the feed-forward network.\nthe hidden size and embedding size are synonymous. Both of them denote the number of real numbers used to represent a token.\nThe notation for encoder stack is written as L/H. For example, BERTBASE is written as 12L/768H, BERTLARGE as 24L/1024H, and BERTTINY as 2L/128H.Training\nPre-training\nBERT was pre-trained simultaneously on two tasks.\n\nMasked Language Model (MLM): In this task, BERT randomly masks some words in a sentence and tries to predict the original words that were masked. For example, in the sentence \"The cat sat on the [MASK],\" BERT would need to predict \"mat.\" This helps BERT learn bidirectional context, meaning it understands the relationships between words not just from left to right or right to left but from both directions at the same time.\nNext Sentence Prediction (NSP): In this task, BERT is trained to predict whether one sentence logically follows another. For example, given two sentences, \"The cat sat on the mat.\" and \"It was a sunny day,\" BERT has to decide if the second sentence is a valid continuation of the first one. This helps BERT understand relationships between sentences, which is important for tasks like question answering or document classification.Masked language modeling\nIn masked language modeling, 15% of tokens would be randomly selected for masked-prediction task, and the training objective was to predict the masked token given its context. In more detail, the selected token is \n\nreplaced with a [MASK] token with probability 80%,\nreplaced with a random word token with probability 10%,\nnot replaced with probability 10%.\nThe reason not all selected tokens are masked is to avoid the dataset shift problem. The dataset shift problem arises when the distribution of inputs seen during training differs significantly from the distribution encountered during inference. A trained BERT model might be applied to word representation (like Word2Vec), where it would be run over sentences not containing any [MASK] tokens. It is later found that more diverse training objectives are generally better.\nAs an illustrative example, consider the sentence \"my dog is cute\". It would first be divided into tokens like \"my1 dog2 is3 cute4\". Then a random token in the sentence would be picked. Let it be the 4th one \"cute4\". Next, there would be three possibilities:\n\nwith probability 80%, the chosen token is masked, resulting in \"my1 dog2 is3 [MASK]4\";\nwith probability 10%, the chosen token is replaced by a uniformly sampled random token, such as \"happy\", resulting in \"my1 dog2 is3 happy4\";\nwith probability 10%, nothing is done, resulting in \"my1 dog2 is3 cute4\".\nAfter processing the input text, the model's 4th output vector is passed to its decoder layer, which outputs a probability distribution over its 30,000-dimensional vocabulary space.Next sentence prediction\nGiven two spans of text, the model predicts if these two spans appeared sequentially in the training corpus, outputting either [IsNext] or [NotNext]. The first span starts with a special token [CLS] (for \"classify\"). The two spans are separated by a special token [SEP] (for \"separate\"). After processing the two spans, the 1-st output vector (the vector coding for [CLS]) is passed to a separate neural network for the binary classification into [IsNext] and [NotNext].\n\nFor example, given \"[CLS] my dog is cute [SEP] he likes playing\" the model should output token [IsNext].\nGiven \"[CLS] my dog is cute [SEP] how do magnets work\" the model should output token [NotNext].Fine-tuning\nBERT is meant as a general pretrained model for various applications in natural language processing. That is, after pre-training, BERT can be fine-tuned with fewer resources on smaller datasets to optimize its performance on specific tasks such as natural language inference and text classification, and sequence-to-sequence-based language generation tasks such as question answering and conversational response generation.\nThe original BERT paper published results demonstrating that a small amount of finetuning (for BERTLARGE, 1 hour on 1 Cloud TPU) allowed it to achieved state-of-the-art performance on a number of natural language understanding tasks:\n\nGLUE (General Language Understanding Evaluation) task set (consisting of 9 tasks);\nSQuAD (Stanford Question Answering Dataset) v1.1 and v2.0;\nSWAG (Situations With Adversarial Generations).\nIn the original paper, all parameters of BERT are finetuned, and recommended that, for downstream applications that are text classifications, the output token at the [CLS] input token is fed into a linear-softmax layer to produce the label outputs.\nThe original code base defined the final linear layer as a \"pooler layer\", in analogy with global pooling in computer vision, even though it simply discards all output tokens except the one corresponding to  [CLS] .Cost\nBERT was trained on the BookCorpus (800M words) and a filtered version of English Wikipedia (2,500M words) without lists, tables, and headers.\nTraining BERTBASE  on 4 cloud TPU (16 TPU chips total) took 4 days, at an estimated cost of 500 USD. Training BERTLARGE on 16 cloud TPU (64 TPU chips total) took 4 days.Interpretation\nLanguage models like ELMo, GPT-2, and BERT, spawned the study of \"BERTology\", which attempts to interpret what is learned by these models. Their performance on these natural language understanding tasks are not yet well understood. Several research publications in 2018 and 2019 focused on investigating the relationship behind BERT's output as a result of carefully chosen input sequences, analysis of internal vector representations through probing classifiers, and the relationships represented by attention weights.\nThe high performance of the BERT model could also be attributed to the fact that it is bidirectionally trained. This means that BERT, based on the Transformer model architecture, applies its self-attention mechanism to learn information from a text from the left and right side during training, and consequently gains a deep understanding of the context. For example, the word fine can have two different meanings depending on the context (I feel fine today, She has fine blond hair). BERT considers the words surrounding the target word fine from the left and right side.\nHowever it comes at a cost: due to encoder-only architecture lacking a decoder, BERT can't be prompted and can't generate text, while bidirectional models in general do not work effectively without the right side, thus being difficult to prompt. As an illustrative example, if one wishes to use BERT to continue a sentence fragment \"Today, I went to\", then naively one would mask out all the tokens as \"Today, I went to  [MASK]  [MASK]  [MASK] ...  [MASK] .\" where the number of  [MASK]  is the length of the sentence one wishes to extend to. However, this constitutes a dataset shift, as during training, BERT has never seen sentences with that many tokens masked out. Consequently, its performance degrades. More sophisticated techniques allow text generation, but at a high computational cost.History\nBERT was originally published by Google researchers Jacob Devlin, Ming-Wei Chang, Kenton Lee, and Kristina Toutanova. The design has its origins from pre-training contextual representations, including semi-supervised sequence learning, generative pre-training, ELMo, and ULMFit. Unlike previous models, BERT is a deeply bidirectional, unsupervised language representation, pre-trained using only a plain text corpus. Context-free models such as word2vec or GloVe generate a single word embedding representation for each word in the vocabulary, whereas BERT takes into account the context for each occurrence of a given word. For instance, whereas the vector for \"running\" will have the same word2vec vector representation for both of its occurrences in the sentences \"He is running a company\" and \"He is running a marathon\", BERT will provide a contextualized embedding that will be different according to the sentence.\nOn October 25, 2019, Google announced that they had started applying BERT models for English language search queries within the US. On December 9, 2019, it was reported that BERT had been adopted by Google Search for over 70 languages. In October 2020, almost every single English-based query was processed by a BERT model.Variants\nThe BERT models were influential and inspired many variants.\nRoBERTa (2019) was an engineering improvement. It preserves BERT's architecture (slightly larger, at 355M parameters), but improves its training, changing key hyperparameters, removing the next-sentence prediction task, and using much larger mini-batch sizes. \nDistilBERT (2019) distills BERTBASE to a model with just 60% of its parameters (66M), while preserving 95% of its benchmark scores. Similarly, TinyBERT (2019) is a distilled model with just 28% of its parameters.\nALBERT (2019) used shared-parameter across layers, and experimented with independently varying the hidden size and the word-embedding layer's output size as two hyperparameters. They also replaced the next sentence prediction task with the sentence-order prediction (SOP) task, where the model must distinguish the correct order of two consecutive text segments from their reversed order. \nELECTRA (2020) applied the idea of generative adversarial networks to the MLM task. Instead of masking out tokens, a small language model generates random plausible substitutions, and a larger network identify these replaced tokens. The small model aims to fool the large model.\nDeBERTa (2020) is a significant architectural variant, with disentangled attention. Its key idea is to treat the positional and token encodings separately throughout the attention mechanism. Instead of combining the positional encoding (\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          x\n          \n            p\n            o\n            s\n            i\n            t\n            i\n            o\n            n\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x_{position}}\n  \n) and token encoding (\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          x\n          \n            token\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x_{\\text{token}}}\n  \n) into a single input vector (\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          x\n          \n            i\n            n\n            p\n            u\n            t\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          x\n          \n            p\n            o\n            s\n            i\n            t\n            i\n            o\n            n\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          x\n          \n            t\n            o\n            k\n            e\n            n\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x_{input}=x_{position}+x_{token}}\n  \n), DeBERTa keeps them separate as a tuple: (\n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        \n          x\n          \n            p\n            o\n            s\n            i\n            t\n            i\n            o\n            n\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          x\n          \n            t\n            o\n            k\n            e\n            n\n          \n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (x_{position},x_{token})}\n  \n).

BERT was created by Jacob Devlin and his colleagues at Google in 2018. It is based on the transformer model architecture, which uses self-attention mechanisms to process entire sentences rather than individual word pairs. BERT was trained on a large corpus of English text and has become one of the most widely used models in NLP research. BERT can be fine-tuned for a variety of NLP tasks, such as question answering, sentiment analysis, and named entity recognition, with state-of-the-art results.\n\nThe original version of BERT was trained on the 3.3 billion-token BookCorpus dataset. Subsequent versions of BERT, such as BERT-Large, have been trained on larger datasets and have achieved even better results on many NLP tasks. In 2019, a version of BERT called Multilingual BERT was introduced, which can be used with 100 languages.\n\nBERT is usually trained in an unsupervised manner using only the input text data. This makes it a popular choice for NLP tasks because it does not require labeled data, which can be expensive and time-consuming to obtain. Instead, BERT learns general-purpose representations of words and phrases that can be applied to a wide range of tasks. BERT is often used as a baseline model for new NLP tasks, and its performance is frequently used as a benchmark for other models.\n\nAlthough there are other transformer-based language models, such as GPT-3 and T5, BERT remains a popular choice for many NLP tasks due to its simplicity and effectiveness. BERT has been used in a wide range of applications, from chatbots to machine translation. Its success has led to a surge of interest in NLP research and has helped to advance the state of the art in many areas of natural language processing.\n\nBERT is trained using two tasks, masked language modeling and next sentence prediction. During training, BERT is not given any labels; instead, it is trained to predict missing words in a sentence and to predict whether two sentences are consecutive. BERT can then be fine-tuned for a specific task by adding a task-specific layer on top of the pre-trained model and training the entire system on the desired task. BERT has achieved state-of-the-art results on a wide range of NLP tasks, including question answering, natural language inference, and sentiment analysis.\n\nOne of the main advantages of BERT is its ability to capture both local and global contextual information. BERT uses a technique called bidirectional attention to capture information from both directions of a sentence, allowing it to better understand the meaning of words in context. This has been shown to be particularly effective for tasks such as sentiment analysis and named entity recognition, where the context in which a word appears is important.\n\nAnother advantage of BERT is its ability to handle long-range dependencies in text. Because BERT uses attention mechanisms, it can attend to any part of the input sequence when generating a particular output, allowing it to capture dependencies that span long distances in the text. This has been shown to be particularly useful for tasks such as question answering and machine translation, where long-range dependencies are common.\n\nDespite its success, BERT also has some limitations. One limitation is its computational cost. BERT models can be very large, with billions of parameters, making them expensive to train and run. This has limited their use in some settings, such as mobile or embedded systems, where computational resources may be limited. Another limitation of BERT is its lack of interpretability. Because BERT uses complex neural network architectures, it can be difficult to understand how the model arrives at a particular decision or prediction. This has limited its use in domains where interpretability is important, such as healthcare or finance.\n\nIn recent years, several extensions and alternatives to BERT have been proposed. These include models such as ELMo, ULMFiT, OpenAI's GPT series, and XLNet. However, despite these advances, BERT remains one of the most widely used and influential models in NLP, and its impact on the field has been profound.\n\nBERT has become a standard tool in the NLP toolkit, and its influence can be seen in a wide range of applications, from chatbots to machine translation. Its success has helped to advance the state of the art in NLP and has inspired a new generation of researchers to explore the potential of transformer-based models for NLP tasks. As the field of NLP continues to evolve, BERT will likely remain an important model for many years to come.\n\nIn July 2020, BERT became the first-ever NLP model to be integrated into Google Search, enabling Google to process language queries more effectively.\n\n# Architecture\n\nBERT uses an encoder-only transformer architecture. The BERT model takes a sentence as input, and outputs an embedding for each token in the sentence. The embedding for the [CLS] token, which is added by the user to the input, is used for tasks such as classification.\n\nThe architecture of BERT is similar to that of the Transformer model, which uses self-attention mechanisms to process entire sentences rather than individual word pairs. Self-attention mechanisms allow the model to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence when generating a particular output, enabling it to capture both local and global contextual information.\n\nThe BERT model consists of an embedding layer, a multi-layer transformer encoder, and a task-specific output layer. The embedding layer maps each token in the input sequence to a high-dimensional vector, which is then passed to the transformer encoder. The transformer encoder consists of a stack of self-attention layers, which compute weighted sums of the input vectors, taking into account the relationships between all pairs of words in the sentence. The output of the transformer encoder is passed to the task-specific output layer, which produces the final output of the model.\n\nThe BERT model can be fine-tuned for a variety of NLP tasks, such as question answering, sentiment analysis, and named entity recognition, with state-of-the-art results. Fine-tuning involves adding a task-specific layer on top of the pre-trained BERT model and training the entire system on the desired task. This allows the model to learn task-specific representations that are tailored to the particularities of the task at hand.\n\nThe BERT architecture has been highly influential in the NLP community, and has inspired a wide range of extensions and variations. For example, some researchers have explored ways to improve the efficiency of the BERT model, while others have investigated ways to make it more interpretable. Despite these advances, the basic architecture of the BERT model remains one of the most widely used and influential models in NLP.\n\nThe BERT architecture is described in the following diagram:\n\n    BERT Architecture\n\n* Tokenizer: Converts input text into a sequence of tokens.\n* Embedding: Maps each token to a high-dimensional vector.\n* Encoder: A stack of transformer layers that compute weighted sums of the input vectors, taking into account the relationships between all pairs of words in the sentence.\n* Task Head: A task-specific output layer that produces the final output of the model.\n\nThe BERT architecture has several key features that enable it to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of NLP tasks. First, the use of self-attention mechanisms allows the model to capture both local and global contextual information, enabling it to better understand the meaning of words in context. Second, the bidirectional nature of the model allows it to capture information from both directions of a sentence, improving its ability to understand the relationships between words. Finally, the use of unsupervised pre-training allows the model to learn general-purpose representations of words and phrases that can be applied to a wide range of tasks.\n\nThese features have made BERT one of the most widely used and influential models in NLP, and its impact on the field has been profound. BERT has been used in a wide range of applications, from chatbots to machine translation, and its success has inspired a new generation of researchers to explore the potential of transformer-based models for NLP tasks. As the field of NLP continues to evolve, BERT will likely remain an important model for many years to come.\n\n# Embedding\n\nBERTBASE uses WordPiece tokenization and has 110M parameters. The vocabulary size is 28,000 (the number of entries in the tokenizer dictionary). The tokenizer breaks text into the following four categories of tokens:\n\n* Word pieces that appear in the basic word dictionary\n* Word pieces that appear in the training data but are not in the basic word dictionary\n* Unknown tokens (e.g., for out-of-vocabulary words)\n* Single-character tokens (e.g., for punctuation)\n\nEach input token is converted into three embeddings:\n\n* Token type embedding: A single token type ID, which is always set to 0 in the implementation, is mapped to a constant-length vector and added to the token embedding. This is used to distinguish between tokens from the first and second sentences in the BERT architecture's next sentence prediction task.\n* Position embedding: The position of the token in the sequence is mapped to a constant-length vector and added to the token embedding. This helps the model understand the order of tokens in the sequence.\n* Segment embedding: The segment that the token belongs to is mapped to a constant-length vector and added to the token embedding. This is used in the BERT architecture's masked language modeling task to indicate whether a token belongs to the input or the randomly generated corrupted input during training.\n\nAll embeddings are added together to produce the final token embedding, which is then fed into the model. The position embedding is initialized randomly and never updated during training. The segment embedding is learned from the data.\n\nThe segment embedding is a learned embedding matrix S \u2208\u211d^|V| \u00d7 d, where |V| is the size of the vocabulary and d is the dimensionality of the embedding.

Text is converted to numerical representations called tokens, and each token is converted into a vector via lookup from a word embedding table. At each layer, each token is then contextualized within the scope of the context window with other (unmasked) tokens via a parallel multi-head attention mechanism, allowing the signal for key tokens to be amplified and less important tokens to be diminished.\nTransformers have the advantage of having no recurrent units, therefore requiring less training time than earlier recurrent neural architectures (RNNs) such as long short-term memory (LSTM). Later variations have been widely adopted for training large language models (LLM) on large (language) datasets.\n\nTransformers were first developed as an improvement over previous architectures for machine translation, but have found many applications since. They are used in large-scale natural language processing, computer vision (vision transformers), reinforcement learning, audio, multimodal learning, robotics, and even playing chess. It has also led to the development of pre-trained systems, such as generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs) and BERT (bidirectional encoder representations from transformers).History\nPredecessors\nFor many years, sequence modelling and generation was done by using plain recurrent neural networks (RNNs). A well-cited early example was the Elman network (1990). In theory, the information from one token can propagate arbitrarily far down the sequence, but in practice the vanishing-gradient problem leaves the model's state at the end of a long sentence without precise, extractable information about preceding tokens.\nA key breakthrough was LSTM (1995), a RNN which used various innovations to overcome the vanishing gradient problem, allowing efficient learning of long-sequence modelling. One key innovation was the use of an attention mechanism which used neurons that multiply the outputs of other neurons, so-called multiplicative units. Neural networks using multiplicative units were later called sigma-pi networks or higher-order networks. LSTM became the standard architecture for long sequence modelling until the 2017 publication of Transformers.\nHowever, LSTM still used sequential processing, like most other RNNs. Specifically, RNNs operate one token at a time from first to last; they cannot operate in parallel over all tokens in a sequence. \nModern Transformers overcome this problem, but unlike RNNs, they require computation time that is quadratic in the size of the context window. The linearly scaling fast weight controller (1992) learns to compute a weight matrix for further processing depending on the input. One of its two networks has \"fast weights\" or \"dynamic links\" (1981). A slow neural network learns by gradient descent to generate keys and values for computing the weight changes of the fast neural network which computes answers to queries. This was later shown to be equivalent to the unnormalized linear Transformer.Attention with seq2seq\nThe idea of encoder-decoder sequence transduction had been developed in the early 2010s (see previous papers). The papers most commonly cited as the originators that produced seq2seq are two concurrently published papers from 2014.\nA 380M-parameter model for machine translation uses two long short-term memories (LSTM). Its architecture consists of two parts. The encoder is an LSTM that takes in a sequence of tokens and turns it into a vector. The decoder is another LSTM that converts the vector into a sequence of tokens. Similarly, another 130M-parameter model used gated recurrent units (GRU) instead of LSTM. Later research showed that GRUs are neither better nor worse than LSTMs for seq2seq.\nThese early seq2seq models had no attention mechanism, and the state vector is accessible only after the last word of the source text was processed. Although in theory such a vector retains the information about the whole original sentence, in practice the information is poorly preserved. This is because the input is processed sequentially by one recurrent network into a fixed-size output vector, which is then processed by another recurrent network into an output. If the input is long, then the output vector would not be able to contain all relevant information, degrading the output. As evidence, reversing the input sentence improved seq2seq translation.\nThe RNNsearch model introduced an attention mechanism to seq2seq for machine translation to solve the bottleneck problem (of the fixed-size output vector), allowing the model to process long-distance dependencies more easily. The name is because it \"emulates searching through a source sentence during decoding a translation\".\nThe relative performances were compared between global (that of RNNsearch) and local (sliding window) attention model architectures for machine translation, finding that mixed attention had higher quality than global attention, while local attention reduced translation time.\nIn 2016, Google Translate was revamped to Google Neural Machine Translation, which replaced the previous model based on statistical machine translation. The new model was a seq2seq model where the encoder and the decoder were both 8 layers of bidirectional LSTM. It took nine months to develop, and it outperformed the statistical approach, which took ten years to develop.Parallelizing attention\nSeq2seq models with attention (including self-attention) still suffered from the same issue with recurrent networks, which is that they are hard to parallelize, which prevented them from being accelerated on GPUs. In 2016, decomposable attention applied a self-attention mechanism to feedforward networks, which are easy to parallelize, and achieved SOTA result in textual entailment with an order of magnitude fewer parameters than LSTMs. One of its authors, Jakob Uszkoreit, suspected that attention without recurrence is sufficient for language translation, thus the title \"attention is all you need\". That hypothesis was against conventional wisdom at the time, and even his father Hans Uszkoreit, a well-known computational linguist, was skeptical. In the same year, self-attention (called intra-attention or intra-sentence attention) was proposed for LSTMs.\nIn 2017, the original (100M-sized) encoder-decoder transformer model was proposed in the \"Attention is all you need\" paper. At the time, the focus of the research was on improving seq2seq for machine translation, by removing its recurrence to process all tokens in parallel, but preserving its dot-product attention mechanism to keep its text processing performance. This led to the introduction of a multi-head attention model that was easier to parallelize due to the use of independent heads and the lack of recurrence. Its parallelizability was an important factor to its widespread use in large neural networks.AI boom era\nAlready in spring 2017, even before the \"Attention is all you need\" preprint was published, one of the co-authors applied the \"decoder-only\" variation of the architecture to generate fictitious Wikipedia articles. Transformer architecture is now used alongside many generative models that contribute to the ongoing AI boom.\nIn language modelling, ELMo (2018) was a bi-directional LSTM that produces contextualized word embeddings, improving upon the line of research from bag of words and word2vec. It was followed by BERT (2018), an encoder-only Transformer model. In 2019 October, Google started using BERT to process search queries. In 2020, Google Translate replaced the previous RNN-encoder\u2013RNN-decoder model by a Transformer-encoder\u2013RNN-decoder model.\nStarting in 2018, the OpenAI GPT series of decoder-only Transformers became state of the art in natural language generation. In 2022, a chatbot based on GPT-3, ChatGPT, became unexpectedly popular, triggering a boom around large language models.\nSince 2020, Transformers have been applied in modalities beyond text, including the vision transformer, speech recognition, robotics, and multimodal. The vision transformer, in turn, stimulated new developments in convolutional neural networks. Image and video generators like DALL-E (2021), Stable Diffusion 3 (2024), and Sora (2024), use Transformers to analyse input data (like text prompts) by breaking it down into \"tokens\" and then calculating the relevance between each token using self-attention, which helps the model understand the context and relationships within the data.Training\nMethods for stabilizing training\nThe plain transformer architecture had difficulty converging. In the original paper the authors recommended using learning rate warmup. That is, the learning rate should linearly scale up from 0 to maximal value for the first part of the training (usually recommended to be 2% of the total number of training steps), before decaying again.\nA 2020 paper found that using layer normalization before (instead of after) multiheaded attention and feedforward layers stabilizes training, not requiring learning rate warmup.Pretrain-finetune\nTransformers typically are first pretrained by self-supervised learning on a large generic dataset, followed by supervised fine-tuning on a small task-specific dataset. The pretrain dataset is typically an unlabeled large corpus, such as The Pile. Tasks for pretraining and fine-tuning commonly include:\n\nlanguage modeling\nnext-sentence prediction\nquestion answering\nreading comprehension\nsentiment analysis\nparaphrasing\nThe T5 transformer report documents a large number of natural language pretraining tasks. Some examples are:\n\nrestoring or repairing incomplete or corrupted text. For example, the input, \"Thank you\u202f~~\u202fme to your party\u202f~~\u202fweek\", might generate the output, \"Thank you for inviting me to your party last week\".\ntranslation between natural languages (machine translation)\njudging the pragmatic acceptability of natural language. For example, the following sentence might be judged \"not acceptable\", because even though it is syntactically well-formed, it is improbable in ordinary human usage: The course is jumping well.\nNote that while each of these tasks is trivial or obvious for human native speakers of the language (or languages), they have typically proved challenging for previous generations of machine learning architecture.Tasks\nIn general, there are 3 classes of language modelling tasks: \"masked\", \"autoregressive\", and \"prefixLM\". These classes are independent of a specific modeling architecture such as Transformer, but they are often discussed in the context of Transformer.\nIn a masked task, one or more of the tokens is masked out, and the model would produce a probability distribution predicting what the masked-out tokens are based on the context. The loss function for the task is typically sum of log-perplexities for the masked-out tokens: \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          Loss\n        \n        =\n        \u2212\n        \n          \u2211\n          \n            t\n            \u2208\n            \n              masked tokens\n            \n          \n        \n        ln\n        \u2061\n        (\n        \n          probability of \n        \n        t\n        \n           conditional on its context\n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\text{Loss}}=-\\sum _{t\\in {\\text{masked tokens}}}\\ln({\\text{probability of }}t{\\text{ conditional on its context}})}\n  \nand the model is trained to minimize this loss function. The BERT series of models are trained for masked token prediction and another task.\nIn an autoregressive task, the entire sequence is masked at first, and the model produces a probability distribution for the first token. Then the first token is revealed and the model predicts the second token, and so on. The loss function for the task is still typically the same. The GPT series of models are trained by autoregressive tasks.\nIn a prefixLM task, the sequence is divided into two parts. The first part is presented as context, and the model predicts the first token of the second part. Then that would be revealed, and the model predicts the second token, and so on. The loss function for the task is still typically the same. The T5 series of models are trained by prefixLM tasks.\nNote that \"masked\" as in \"masked language modelling\" is not \"masked\" as in \"masked attention\", and \"prefixLM\" (prefix language modeling) is not \"prefixLM\" (prefix language model).Architecture\nAll transformers have the same primary components:\n\nTokenizers, which convert text into tokens.\nEmbedding layer, which converts tokens and positions of the tokens into vector representations.\nTransformer layers, which carry out repeated transformations on the vector representations, extracting more and more linguistic information. These consist of alternating attention and feedforward layers. There are two major types of transformer layers: encoder layers and decoder layers, with further variants.\nUn-embedding layer, which converts the final vector representations back to a probability distribution over the tokens.\nThe following description follows exactly the Transformer as described in the original paper. There are variants, described in the following section.\nBy convention, we write all vectors as row vectors. This, for example, means that pushing a vector through a linear layer means multiplying it by a weight matrix on the right, as \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n        W\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle xW}\n  \n.Tokenization\nAs the Transformer architecture natively processes numerical data, not text, there must be a translation between text and tokens. A token is an integer that represents a character, or a short segment of characters. On the input side, the input text is parsed into a token sequence. Similarly, on the output side, the output tokens are parsed back to text. The module doing the conversion between texts and token sequences is a tokenizer.\nThe set of all tokens is the vocabulary of the tokenizer, and its size is the vocabulary size \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          n\n          \n            vocabulary\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n_{\\text{vocabulary}}}\n  \n. When faced with tokens outside the vocabulary, typically a special token is used, written as \"[UNK]\" for \"unknown\".\nSome commonly used tokenizers are byte pair encoding, WordPiece, and SentencePiece.Embedding\nEach token is converted into an embedding vector via a lookup table. Equivalently stated, it multiplies a one-hot representation of the token by an embedding matrix \n  \n    \n      \n        M\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle M}\n  \n. For example, if the input token is \n  \n    \n      \n        3\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 3}\n  \n, then the one-hot representation is \n  \n    \n      \n        [\n        0\n        ,\n        0\n        ,\n        0\n        ,\n        1\n        ,\n        0\n        ,\n        0\n        ,\n        \u2026\n        ]\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle [0,0,0,1,0,0,\\dots ]}\n  \n, and its embedding vector is\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          E\n          m\n          b\n          e\n          d\n        \n        (\n        3\n        )\n        =\n        [\n        0\n        ,\n        0\n        ,\n        0\n        ,\n        1\n        ,\n        0\n        ,\n        0\n        ,\n        \u2026\n        ]\n        M\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {Embed} (3)=[0,0,0,1,0,0,\\dots ]M}\n  \nThe token embedding vectors are added to their respective positional encoding vectors (see below), producing the sequence of input vectors. \nThe number of dimensions in an embedding vector is called hidden size or embedding size and written as \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          d\n          \n            emb\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle d_{\\text{emb}}}\n  \n. This size is written as \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          d\n          \n            model\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle d_{\\text{model}}}\n  \n in the original Transformer paper.Un-embedding\nAn un-embedding layer is almost the reverse of an embedding layer. Whereas an embedding layer converts a token into a vector, an un-embedding layer converts a vector into a probability distribution over tokens.\nThe un-embedding layer is a linear-softmax layer:\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          U\n          n\n          E\n          m\n          b\n          e\n          d\n        \n        (\n        x\n        )\n        =\n        \n          s\n          o\n          f\n          t\n          m\n          a\n          x\n        \n        (\n        x\n        W\n        +\n        b\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {UnEmbed} (x)=\\mathrm {softmax} (xW+b)}\n  \nThe matrix has shape \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        \n          d\n          \n            emb\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          n\n          \n            vocabulary\n          \n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (d_{\\text{emb}},n_{\\text{vocabulary}})}\n  \n.

This shall induce a bias towards the order of the input sequence, so that, for example, the input sequence \"man bites dog\" is processed differently from \"dog bites man\".\nThe positional encoding is defined as a function of type \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        :\n        \n          R\n        \n        \u2192\n        \n          \n            R\n          \n          \n            d\n          \n        \n        ;\n        d\n        \u2208\n        \n          Z\n        \n        ,\n        d\n        >\n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f:\\mathbb {R} \\to \\mathbb {R} ^{d};d\\in \\mathbb {Z} ,d>0}\n  \n, where \n  \n    \n      \n        d\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle d}\n  \n is a positive even integer.

This allows the transformer to take any encoded position and find a linear sum of the encoded locations of its neighbors. This sum of encoded positions, when fed into the attention mechanism, would create attention weights on its neighbors, much like what happens in a convolutional neural network language model. In the author's words, \"we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by relative position.\"\nIn typical implementations, all operations are done over the real numbers, not the complex numbers, but since complex multiplication can be implemented as real 2-by-2 matrix multiplication, this is a mere notational difference.Encoder-decoder (overview)\nLike earlier seq2seq models, the original transformer model used an encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder consists of encoding layers that process all the input tokens together one layer after another, while the decoder consists of decoding layers that iteratively process the encoder's output and the decoder's output tokens so far.\nThe purpose of each encoder layer is to create contextualized representations of the tokens, where each representation corresponds to a token that \"mixes\" information from other input tokens via self-attention mechanism. Each decoder layer contains two attention sublayers: (1) cross-attention for incorporating the output of encoder (contextualized input token representations), and (2) self-attention for \"mixing\" information among the input tokens to the decoder (i.e. the tokens generated so far during inference time).\nBoth the encoder and decoder layers have a feed-forward neural network for additional processing of their outputs and contain residual connections and layer normalization steps. These feed-forward layers contain most of the parameters in a Transformer model.Feedforward network\nThe feedforward network (FFN) modules in a Transformer are 2-layered multilayer perceptrons:\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          F\n          F\n          N\n        \n        (\n        x\n        )\n        =\n        \u03d5\n        (\n        x\n        \n          W\n          \n            (\n            1\n            )\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          b\n          \n            (\n            1\n            )\n          \n        \n        )\n        \n          W\n          \n            (\n            2\n            )\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          b\n          \n            (\n            2\n            )\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {FFN} (x)=\\phi (xW^{(1)}+b^{(1)})W^{(2)}+b^{(2)}}\n  \nwhere \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          W\n          \n            (\n            1\n            )\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle W^{(1)}}\n  \n and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          W\n          \n            (\n            2\n            )\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle W^{(2)}}\n  \n are weight matrices and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          b\n          \n            (\n            1\n            )\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle b^{(1)}}\n  \n and  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          b\n          \n            (\n            2\n            )\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle b^{(2)}}\n  \n are bias vectors, and \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03d5\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\phi }\n  \n is its activation function. The original Transformer used ReLU activation.\nThe number of neurons in the middle layer is called intermediate size (GPT), filter size (BERT), or feedforward size (BERT). It is typically larger than the embedding size.

While each attention head attends to the tokens that are relevant to each token, multiple attention heads allow the model to do this for different definitions of \"relevance\". Specifically, the query and key projection matrices, \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          W\n          \n            Q\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle W^{Q}}\n  \n and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          W\n          \n            K\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle W^{K}}\n  \n , which are involved in the attention score computation, defines the \"relevance\". Meanwhile, the value projection matrix \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          W\n          \n            V\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle W^{V}}\n  \n, in combination with the part of the output projection matrix \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          W\n          \n            O\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle W^{O}}\n  \n, determines how the attended tokens influence what information is passed to subsequent layers and ultimately the output logits. In addition, the scope of attention, or the range of token relationships captured by each attention head, can expand as tokens pass through successive layers. This allows the model to capture more complex and long-range dependencies in deeper layers. Many transformer attention heads encode relevance relations that are meaningful to humans. For example, some attention heads can attend mostly to the next word, while others mainly attend from verbs to their direct objects. The computations for each attention head can be performed in parallel, which allows for fast processing. The outputs for the attention layer are concatenated to pass into the feed-forward neural network layers.\nConcretely, let the multiple attention heads be indexed by \n  \n    \n      \n        i\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i}\n  \n, then we have\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          MultiheadedAttention\n        \n        (\n        Q\n        ,\n        K\n        ,\n        V\n        )\n        =\n        \n          \n            Concat\n          \n          \n            i\n            \u2208\n            [\n            \n              n\n              \n                heads\n              \n            \n            ]\n          \n        \n        (\n        \n          Attention\n        \n        (\n        Q\n        \n          W\n          \n            i\n          \n          \n            Q\n          \n        \n        ,\n        K\n        \n          W\n          \n            i\n          \n          \n            K\n          \n        \n        ,\n        V\n        \n          W\n          \n            i\n          \n          \n            V\n          \n        \n        )\n        )\n        \n          W\n          \n            O\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\text{MultiheadedAttention}}(Q,K,V)={\\text{Concat}}_{i\\in [n_{\\text{heads}}]}({\\text{Attention}}(QW_{i}^{Q},KW_{i}^{K},VW_{i}^{V}))W^{O}}\n  \n where the matrix \n  \n    \n      \n        X\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle X}\n  \n is the concatenation of word embeddings, and the matrices \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          W\n          \n            i\n          \n          \n            Q\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          W\n          \n            i\n          \n          \n            K\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          W\n          \n            i\n          \n          \n            V\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle W_{i}^{Q},W_{i}^{K},W_{i}^{V}}\n  \n are \"projection matrices\" owned by individual attention head \n  \n    \n      \n        i\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i}\n  \n, and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          W\n          \n            O\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle W^{O}}\n  \n is a final projection matrix owned by the whole multi-headed attention head.\nIt is theoretically possible for each attention head to have a different head dimension \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          d\n          \n            head\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle d_{\\text{head}}}\n  \n, but that is rarely the case in practice.\nAs an example, in the smallest GPT-2 model, there are only self-attention mechanisms.

The first encoder layer takes the sequence of input vectors from the embedding layer, producing a sequence of vectors. This sequence of vectors is processed by the second encoder, and so on. The output from the final encoder layer is then used by the decoder.\nAs the encoder processes the entire input all at once, every token can attend to every other token (all-to-all attention), so there is no need for causal masking.Decoder\nA decoder consists of an embedding layer, followed by multiple decoder layers, followed by an un-embedding layer.\nEach decoder consists of three major components: a causally masked self-attention mechanism, a cross-attention mechanism, and a feed-forward neural network. The decoder functions in a similar fashion to the encoder, but an additional attention mechanism is inserted which instead draws relevant information from the encodings generated by the encoders. This mechanism can also be called the encoder-decoder attention.\nLike the first encoder, the first decoder takes positional information and embeddings of the output sequence as its input, rather than encodings. The transformer must not use the current or future output to predict an output, so the output sequence must be partially masked to prevent this reverse information flow. This allows for autoregressive text generation. For decoding, all-to-all attention is inappropriate, because a token cannot attend to tokens not yet generated. Thus, the self-attention module in the decoder is causally masked.\nIn contrast, the cross-attention mechanism attends to the output vectors of the encoder, which is computed before the decoder starts decoding. Consequently, there is no need for masking in the cross-attention mechanism.\nSchematically, we have:\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                \n                  H\n                  \u2032\n                \n              \n              \n                \n                =\n                \n                  MaskedMultiheadedAttention\n                \n                (\n                H\n                ,\n                H\n                ,\n                H\n                )\n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  DecoderLayer\n                \n                (\n                H\n                )\n              \n              \n                \n                =\n                \n                  FFN\n                \n                (\n                \n                  MultiheadedAttention\n                \n                (\n                \n                  H\n                  \u2032\n                \n                ,\n                \n                  H\n                  \n                    E\n                  \n                \n                ,\n                \n                  H\n                  \n                    E\n                  \n                \n                )\n                )\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\begin{aligned}H'&={\\text{MaskedMultiheadedAttention}}(H,H,H)\\\\{\\text{DecoderLayer}}(H)&={\\text{FFN}}({\\text{MultiheadedAttention}}(H',H^{E},H^{E}))\\end{aligned}}}\n  \nwhere \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          H\n          \n            E\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle H^{E}}\n  \n is the matrix with rows being the output vectors from the encoder.\nThe last decoder is followed by a final un-embedding layer. to produce the output probabilities over the vocabulary. Then, one of the tokens is sampled according to the probability, and the decoder can be run again to produce the next token, etc, autoregressively generating output text.Adapted architectures\nMany large language models, since they do not need to predict a whole new sequence from an input sequence, only use the encoder or decoder of the original transformer architecture. Early GPT models are decoder-only models trained to predict the next token in a sequence. BERT, another language model, only makes use of an encoder, and is trained to predict a randomly masked token in a sequence.Full transformer architecture\nSublayers\nEach encoder layer contains 2 sublayers: the self-attention and the feedforward network. Each decoder layer contains 3 sublayers: the causally masked self-attention, the cross-attention, and the feedforward network.\n\nThe final points of detail are the residual connections and layer normalization (LayerNorm, or LN), which while conceptually unnecessary, are necessary for numerical stability and convergence.  \nThe residual connection, which is introduced to avoid vanishing gradient issues and stabilize the training process, can be expressed as follows: y = F(x) + x. The expression indicates that an output y is the sum of the transformation of input x (F(x)) and the input itself (x). Adding the input x can preserve the input information and avoid issues when the gradient of F(x) is close to zero.  \nSimilarly to how the feedforward network modules are applied individually to each vector, the LayerNorm is also applied individually to each vector. \nThere are two common conventions in use: the post-LN and the pre-LN convention.

The pre-LN convention, proposed several times in 2018, was found to be easier to train, requiring no warm-up, leading to faster convergence.Pseudocode\nThe following is the pseudocode for a standard pre-LN encoder-decoder Transformer, adapted from\n\ninput: Encoder input t_e\n       Decoder input t_d\noutput: Array of probability distributions, with shape (decoder vocabulary size x length(decoder output sequence))\n\n/* encoder */\nz_e \u2190 encoder.tokenizer(t_e)\n\nfor each t in 1:length(z_e) do\n    z_e[t] \u2190 encoder.embedding(z_e[t]) + encoder.positional_embedding(t)\n\nfor each l in 1:length(encoder.layers) do\n    layer \u2190 encoder.layers[l]\n\n    /* first sublayer */\n    z_e_copy \u2190 copy(z_e)\n    for each t in 1:length(z_e) do\n        z_e[t] \u2190 layer.layer_norm(z_e[t])\n    z_e \u2190 layer.multiheaded_attention(z_e, z_e, z_e)\n    for each t in 1:length(z_e) do\n        z_e[t] \u2190 z_e[t] + z_e_copy[t]\n\n    /* second sublayer */\n    z_e_copy \u2190 copy(z_e)\n    for each t in 1:length(z_e) do\n        z_e[t] \u2190 layer.layer_norm(z_e[t])\n    z_e \u2190 layer.feedforward(z_e)\n    for each t in 1:length(z_e) do\n        z_e[t] \u2190 z_e[t] + z_e_copy[t]\n\nfor each t in 1:length(z_e) do\n    z_e[t] \u2190 encoder.final_layer_norm(z_e[t])\n\n/* decoder */\nz_d \u2190 decoder.tokenizer(t_d)\n\nfor each t in 1:length(z_d) do\n    z_d[t] \u2190 decoder.embedding(z_d[t]) + decoder.positional_embedding(t)\n\nfor each l in 1:length(decoder.layers) do\n        layer \u2190 decoder.layers[l]\n\n        /* first sublayer */\n        z_d_copy \u2190 copy(z_d)\n        for each t in 1:length(z_d) do\n            z_d[t] \u2190 layer.layer_norm(z_d[t])\n        z_d \u2190 layer.masked_multiheaded_attention(z_d, z_d, z_d)\n        for each t in 1:length(z_d) do\n            z_d[t] \u2190 z_d[t] + z_d_copy[t]\n\n        /* second sublayer */\n        z_d_copy \u2190 copy(z_d)\n        for each t in 1:length(z_d) do\n            z_d[t] \u2190 layer.layer_norm(z_d[t])\n        z_d \u2190 layer.multiheaded_attention(z_d, z_e, z_e) \n        for each i in 1:length(z_d) do\n            z_d[t] \u2190 z_d[t] + z_d_copy[t]\n\n        /* third sublayer */\n        z_d_copy \u2190 copy(z_d)\n        for each t in 1:length(z_d) do\n            z_d[t] \u2190 layer.layer_norm(z_d[t])\n        z_d \u2190 layer.feedforward(z_d)\n        for each t in 1:length(z_d) do\n            z_d[t] \u2190 z_d[t] + z_d_copy[t]\n\nz_d \u2190 decoder.final_layer_norm(z_d)\n\noutput_distributions \u2190 []\nfor each t in 1:length(z_d) do\n    output_distributions.append(decoder.unembed(z_d[t]))\n\nreturn output_distributionsTerminology\nThe Transformer architecture, being modular, allows variations. Several common variations are described here.\nAn \"encoder-only\" Transformer applies the encoder to map an input text into a sequence of vectors that represent the input text. This is usually used for text embedding and representation learning for downstream applications. BERT is encoder-only. They are less often used currently, as they were found to be not significantly better than training an encoder-decoder Transformer, then taking just the encoder.\nA \"decoder-only\" Transformer is not literally decoder-only, since without an encoder, the cross-attention mechanism has nothing to attend to. Thus, the decoder layers in a decoder-only Transformer is composed of just two sublayers: the causally masked self-attention, and the feedforward network. This is usually used for text generation and instruction following. The models in the GPT series and Chinchilla series are decoder-only.\nAn \"encoder-decoder\" Transformer is generally the same as the original Transformer, with 2 sublayers per encoder layer and 3 sublayers per decoder layer, etc. They might have minor architectural improvements, such as alternative activation functions, changing the location of normalization, etc. This is also usually used for text generation and instruction following. The models in the T5 series are encoder-decoder.\nA \"prefixLM\" (prefix language model) is a decoder-only architecture, but with prefix masking, which is different from causal masking. Specifically, it has mask of the form:\u200aFigure 3\u200a\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          M\n          \n            prefixLM\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            [\n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    0\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \u2212\n                  \u221e\n                \n              \n              \n                \n                  \n                    0\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    M\n                    \n                      causal\n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n            ]\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle M_{\\text{prefixLM}}={\\begin{bmatrix}\\mathbf {0} &-\\infty \\\\\\mathbf {0} &M_{\\text{causal}}\\end{bmatrix}}}\n  \nwhere the first columns correspond to the \"prefix\", and the subsequent columns correspond to the autoregressively generated text based on the prefix. They resemble encoder-decoder models, but has less \"sparsity\". Such models are rarely used, though they are cited as theoretical possibilities and benchmarked comparisons.\nThere are also mixed seq2seq models. For example, in 2020, Google Translate replaced the previous RNN-encoder\u2013RNN-decoder model by a Transformer-encoder\u2013RNN-decoder model, on the argument that an RNN-decoder runs much faster than Transformer-decoder when run autoregressively.Subsequent work\nAlternative activation functions\nThe original transformer uses ReLU activation function. Other activation functions were developed. The Llama series and PaLM used SwiGLU; both GPT-1 and BERT used GELU. \nAlternative activation functions are often used in combination with Gated Linear Units in the feedforward module.Alternative normalizations\nThe normalization used in the Transformer can be different from LayerNorm. One example is RMSNorm which is used in the Llama series. Other examples include CapsuleNorm ScaleNorm, or FixNorm.Alternative positional encodings\nTransformers may use other positional encoding methods than sinusoidal. \nThe original Transformer paper reported using a learned positional encoding, but finding it not superior to the sinusoidal one. Later,  found that causal masking itself provides enough signal to a Transformer decoder that it can learn to implicitly perform absolute positional encoding without the positional encoding module.RoPE\nRoPE (rotary positional embedding), is best explained by considering a list of 2-dimensional vectors \n  \n    \n      \n        [\n        (\n        \n          x\n          \n            1\n          \n          \n            (\n            1\n            )\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          x\n          \n            1\n          \n          \n            (\n            2\n            )\n          \n        \n        )\n        ,\n        (\n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n          \n            (\n            1\n            )\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n          \n            (\n            2\n            )\n          \n        \n        )\n        ,\n        (\n        \n          x\n          \n            3\n          \n          \n            (\n            1\n            )\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          x\n          \n            3\n          \n          \n            (\n            2\n            )\n          \n        \n        )\n        ,\n        .\n        .\n        .\n        ]\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle [(x_{1}^{(1)},x_{1}^{(2)}),(x_{2}^{(1)},x_{2}^{(2)}),(x_{3}^{(1)},x_{3}^{(2)}),...]}\n  \n.

Since it is directly plugged into the attention mechanism, it can be combined with any positional encoder that is plugged into the \"bottom\" of the entire network (which is where the sinusoidal encoder on the original transformer, as well as RoPE and many others, are located).Relative Position Encodings\nRelative Position Encodings is similar to ALiBi, but more generic:\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                \n                  Attention\n                \n                (\n                Q\n                ,\n                K\n                ,\n                V\n                )\n                =\n                \n                  softmax\n                \n                \n                  (\n                  \n                    \n                      \n                        \n                          Q\n                          \n                            K\n                            \n                              \n                                T\n                              \n                            \n                          \n                        \n                        \n                          \n                            d\n                            \n                              k\n                            \n                          \n                        \n                      \n                    \n                    +\n                    B\n                  \n                  )\n                \n                V\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\begin{aligned}{\\text{Attention}}(Q,K,V)={\\text{softmax}}\\left({\\frac {QK^{\\mathrm {T} }}{\\sqrt {d_{k}}}}+B\\right)V\\end{aligned}}}\n  \nwhere \n  \n    \n      \n        B\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle B}\n  \n is a Toeplitz matrix, that is, \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          B\n          \n            i\n            ,\n            j\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          B\n          \n            \n              i\n              \u2032\n            \n            ,\n            \n              j\n              \u2032\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle B_{i,j}=B_{i',j'}}\n  \n whenever \n  \n    \n      \n        i\n        \u2212\n        j\n        =\n        \n          i\n          \u2032\n        \n        \u2212\n        \n          j\n          \u2032\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i-j=i'-j'}\n  \n. This is contrasted with the original sinusoidal positional encoding, which is an \"absolute positional encoding\".Efficient implementation\nThe transformer model has been implemented in standard deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch. Transformers is a library produced by Hugging Face that supplies transformer-based architectures and pretrained models.KV caching\nWhen an autoregressive transformer is used for inference, such as generating text, the query vector is different at each step, but the already-computed key and value vectors are always the same. The KV caching method saves the computed key and value vectors at each attention block, so that they are not recomputed at each new token. PagedAttention applies memory paging to KV caching.\nIf a transformer is used with a baked-in prompt, such as [\"You are a customer support agent...\"], then the key and value vectors can be computed for the prompt, and saved on disk. The saving in compute is significant when the model is used for many short interactions, such as in online chatbots.FlashAttention\nFlashAttention is an algorithm that implements the transformer attention mechanism efficiently on a GPU. It is a communication-avoiding algorithm that performs matrix multiplications in blocks, such that each block fits within the cache of a GPU, and by careful management of the blocks it minimizes data copying between GPU caches (as data movement is slow). See the page on softmax for details.\nAn improved version, FlashAttention-2, was developed to cater to the rising demand for language models capable of handling longer context lengths. It offers enhancements in work partitioning and parallelism, enabling it to achieve up to 230 TFLOPs/s on A100 GPUs (FP16/BF16), a 2x speed increase over the original FlashAttention.\nKey advancements in FlashAttention-2 include the reduction of non-matmul FLOPs, improved parallelism over the sequence length dimension, better work partitioning between GPU warps, and added support for head dimensions up to 256 and multi-query attention (MQA) and grouped-query attention (GQA).\nBenchmarks revealed FlashAttention-2 to be up to 2x faster than FlashAttention and up to 9x faster than a standard attention implementation in PyTorch. Future developments include optimization for new hardware like H100 GPUs and new data types like FP8.Multi-Query Attention\nMulti-Query Attention changes the multiheaded attention mechanism.

MQA is GQA with one group, while standard multiheaded attention is GQA with the maximal number of groups.\n\nMultihead Latent Attention (MLA) is a low-rank approximation to standard MHA. Specifically, each hidden vector, before entering the attention mechanism, is first projected to two low-dimensional spaces (\"latent space\"), one for query and one for key-value (KV vector). This design minimizes the KV cache, as only the low-dimensional KV vector needs to be cached.Speculative decoding\nSpeculative decoding is a method to accelerate token decoding. Similarly to speculative execution in CPUs, future tokens are computed quickly, then verified. If the quickly computed tokens are incorrect, they are discarded and computed slowly.\nThe key factor in speculative decoding is that a Transformer decoder can verify faster than it can decode, in the following sense.\nSuppose we have two transformer models like GPT-3 and GPT-3-small, both with a context window size of 512. To generate an entire context window autoregressively with greedy decoding with GPT-3, it must be run for 512 times, each time generating a token \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          x\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        ,\n        .\n        .\n        .\n        ,\n        \n          x\n          \n            512\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{512}}\n  \n, taking time \n  \n    \n      \n        512\n        \n          T\n          \n            GPT-3\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 512T_{\\text{GPT-3}}}\n  \n. However, if we had some educated guess for the values of these tokens, we could verify all of them in parallel, in one run of the model, by checking that each \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          x\n          \n            t\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x_{t}}\n  \n is indeed the token with the largest log-likelihood in the \n  \n    \n      \n        t\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle t}\n  \n-th output.\nIn speculative decoding, a smaller model or some other simple heuristic is used to generate a few speculative tokens that are subsequently verified by the larger model. For example, suppose we use GPT-3-small to generate four speculative tokens: \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                x\n                ~\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          \n            \n              \n                x\n                ~\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          \n            \n              \n                x\n                ~\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            3\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          \n            \n              \n                x\n                ~\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            4\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\tilde {x}}_{1},{\\tilde {x}}_{2},{\\tilde {x}}_{3},{\\tilde {x}}_{4}}\n  \n.

However, that vector can then be further processed by another Transformer block to predict the next token, and so on for arbitrarily many steps into the future. This trades off accuracy for speed, since each new token costs just one more Transformer block, rather than the entire stack.Sub-quadratic transformers\nTraining transformer-based architectures can be expensive, especially for long inputs. Many methods have been developed to attempt to address the issue. In the image domain, Swin Transformer is an efficient architecture that performs attention inside shifting windows. In the audio domain, SepTr decouples the attention in time and frequency domains. Long Range Arena (2020) is a standard benchmark for comparing the behavior of transformer architectures over long inputs.Alternative attention graphs\nThe standard attention graph is either all-to-all or causal, both of which scales as \n  \n    \n      \n        O\n        (\n        \n          N\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle O(N^{2})}\n  \n where \n  \n    \n      \n        N\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle N}\n  \n is the number of tokens in a sequence.\nReformer (2020) reduces the computational load from \n  \n    \n      \n        O\n        (\n        \n          N\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle O(N^{2})}\n  \n to \n  \n    \n      \n        O\n        (\n        N\n        ln\n        \u2061\n        N\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle O(N\\ln N)}\n  \n by using locality-sensitive hashing and reversible layers. \nSparse attention uses attention graphs that grows slower than \n  \n    \n      \n        O\n        (\n        \n          N\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle O(N^{2})}\n  \n. For example, BigBird (2020) uses random small-world networks which grows as \n  \n    \n      \n        O\n        (\n        N\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle O(N)}\n  \n.\nOrdinary transformers require a memory size that is quadratic in the size of the context window. Attention-free transformers reduce this to a linear dependence while still retaining the advantages of a transformer by linking the key to the value.Random Feature Attention\nRandom Feature Attention (2021) uses Fourier random features:\n  \n    \n      \n        \u03c6\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        =\n        \n          \n            1\n            \n              D\n            \n          \n        \n        [\n        cos\n        \u2061\n        \u27e8\n        \n          w\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        x\n        \u27e9\n        ,\n        sin\n        \u2061\n        \u27e8\n        \n          w\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        x\n        \u27e9\n        ,\n        \u22ef\n        cos\n        \u2061\n        \u27e8\n        \n          w\n          \n            D\n          \n        \n        ,\n        x\n        \u27e9\n        ,\n        sin\n        \u2061\n        \u27e8\n        \n          w\n          \n            D\n          \n        \n        ,\n        x\n        \u27e9\n        \n          ]\n          \n            T\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\varphi (x)={\\frac {1}{\\sqrt {D}}}[\\cos \\langle w_{1},x\\rangle ,\\sin \\langle w_{1},x\\rangle ,\\cdots \\cos \\langle w_{D},x\\rangle ,\\sin \\langle w_{D},x\\rangle ]^{T}}\n  \nwhere \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          w\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        .\n        .\n        .\n        ,\n        \n          w\n          \n            D\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle w_{1},...,w_{D}}\n  \n are independent samples from the normal distribution \n  \n    \n      \n        N\n        (\n        0\n        ,\n        \n          \u03c3\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        I\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle N(0,\\sigma ^{2}I)}\n  \n.

A 2022 study found that Transformers pretrained only on natural language can be finetuned on only 0.03% of parameters and become competitive with LSTMs on a variety of logical and visual tasks, demonstrating transfer learning. The LLaVA was a vision-language model composed of a language model (Vicuna-13B) and a vision model (ViT-L/14), connected by a linear layer. Only the linear layer is finetuned.\nVision transformers adapt the transformer to computer vision by breaking down input images as a series of patches, turning them into vectors, and treating them like tokens in a standard transformer.\nConformer and later Whisper follow the same pattern for speech recognition, first turning the speech signal into a spectrogram, which is then treated like an image, i.e. broken down into a series of patches, turned into vectors and treated like tokens in a standard transformer.\nPerceivers are a variant of Transformers designed for multimodality.\nFor image generation, notable architectures are DALL-E 1 (2021), Parti (2022), Phenaki (2023), and Muse (2023). Unlike later models, DALL-E is not a diffusion model. Instead, it uses a decoder-only Transformer that autoregressively generates a text, followed by the token representation of an image, which is then converted by a variational autoencoder to an image. Parti is an encoder-decoder Transformer, where the encoder processes a text prompt, and the decoder generates a token representation of an image. Muse is an encoder-only Transformer that is trained to predict masked image tokens from unmasked image tokens. During generation, all input tokens are masked, and the highest-confidence predictions are included for the next iteration, until all tokens are predicted. Phenaki is a text-to-video model. It is a bidirectional masked transformer conditioned on pre-computed text tokens. The generated tokens are then decoded to a video.Applications\nThe transformer has had great success in natural language processing (NLP). Many large language models such as GPT-2, GPT-3, GPT-4, Gemini, AlbertAGPT, Claude, BERT, Grok, XLNet, RoBERTa and ChatGPT demonstrate the ability of transformers to perform a wide variety of NLP-related subtasks and their related real-world applications, including:\n\nmachine translation\ntime series prediction\ndocument summarization\ndocument generation\nnamed entity recognition (NER)\nwriting computer code based on requirements expressed in natural language.\nspeech-to-text\nBeyond traditional NLP, the transformer architecture has had success in other applications, such as:\n\nbiological sequence analysis\nvideo understanding\nprotein folding (such as AlphaFold)\nevaluating chess board positions. Using static evaluation alone (that is, with no Minimax search) transformer achieved an Elo of 2895, putting it at grandmaster level.See also\nseq2seq \u2013 Family of machine learning approaches\nPerceiver \u2013 Variant of Transformer designed for multimodal data\nVision transformer \u2013 Machine learning model for vision processing\nLarge language model \u2013 Type of machine learning model\nBERT (language model) \u2013 Series of language models developed by Google AI\nGenerative pre-trained transformer \u2013 Type of large language model\nT5 (language model) \u2013 Series of large language models developed by Google AINotes\nReferences\n== Further reading ==", "result": "The transformer is a deep learning architecture that was introduced in 2017 in the paper \"Attention Is All You Need\" by Google researchers.

In electrical engineering, a transformer is an electrical device that transfers electrical energy between two or more circuits through electromagnetic induction. In the context of deep learning, the term \"Transformer\" refers to a specific type of neural network architecture that uses attention mechanisms to selectively focus on different parts of an input sequence when generating each element of an output sequence.\n\nThe history of the Transformer in deep learning dates back to the 1950s with the introduction of RNNs, which were initially limited by the Vanishing Gradient Problem.

However, LSTMs and GRUs still had difficulties with capturing long-term dependencies and were computationally expensive.\n\nThe idea of attention mechanisms in neural networks was introduced in 1998 by Yoshua Bengio et al., who proposed the additive model attention mechanism. In 2014, Kyunghyun Cho et al. proposed the multiplicative model attention mechanism in their paper \"Learning phrase representations using RNN encoder-decoder for statistical machine translation\".

Since then, the Transformer architecture has evolved and been adapted for various tasks and modalities, giving rise to many new models such as BERT, GPT, T5, and PaLM.\n\nThe Transformer architecture is a deep learning model that uses attention mechanisms to selectively focus on different parts of an input sequence when generating each element of an output sequence. It was introduced in the 2017 paper \"Attention Is All You Need\" by Vaswani et al. The Transformer architecture is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that uses attention mechanisms to selectively focus on different parts of an input sequence when generating each element of an output sequence. Unlike previous RNN architectures such as LSTMs and GRUs, the Transformer does not use recurrence, instead using attention mechanisms to capture dependencies between elements of the input and output sequences.\n\nThe Transformer architecture is composed of an encoder and a decoder, each consisting of multiple identical layers. Each layer contains two main sub-layers: the self-attention mechanism and a feed-forward neural network. The self-attention mechanism allows the model to weigh the importance of different elements of the input sequence when generating each element of the output sequence, while the feed-forward neural network allows the model to learn nonlinear relationships between the input and output sequences.\n\nThe Transformer architecture has several key advantages over previous RNN architectures. First, it eliminates the need for recurrence, which can suffer from problems such as vanishing gradients and difficulty capturing long-term dependencies. Second, it allows for parallel processing of the input and output sequences, making it more efficient than previous architectures. Finally, it enables the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence at each step of the output sequence generation, allowing it to capture complex dependencies between elements of the sequence.\n\nThe Transformer architecture has achieved state-of-the-art results in a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) and machine translation tasks. Its success has led to the development of many new models based on the Transformer architecture, such as BERT, GPT, T5, and PaLM. These models have achieved remarkable results on a wide range of tasks, including language understanding, generation, and reasoning, as well as other modalities such as vision and multimodal tasks. They have been widely adopted in industry and academia, powering applications such as chatbots, virtual assistants, content generation, and automated translation systems.\n\nThe Transformer architecture has revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence and natural language processing, enabling new levels of performance and efficiency in a wide range of applications. Its impact extends far beyond NLP, with potential applications in areas such as computer vision, speech recognition, and reinforcement learning.\n\nThe Transformer architecture has had a profound impact on the field of deep learning and artificial intelligence, and its influence continues to grow. As researchers and practitioners continue to explore new applications and variations of the Transformer architecture, it is likely that we will see even greater advances in the field of artificial intelligence in the years to come.\n\nThe following sections provide an overview of the key concepts and components of the Transformer architecture, including its history, applications, and impact on deep learning and artificial intelligence.\n\nThe history of the Transformer in deep learning dates back to the 1950s with the introduction of RNNs, which were initially limited by the Vanishing Gradient Problem. The Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) architectures were developed in the late 1990s and early 2000s to overcome this limitation. However, LSTMs and GRUs still had difficulties with capturing long-term dependencies and were computationally expensive.\n\nThe idea of attention mechanisms in neural networks was introduced in 1998 by Yoshua Bengio et al., who proposed the additive model attention mechanism. In 2014, Kyunghyun Cho et al. proposed the multiplicative model attention mechanism in their paper \"Learning phrase representations using RNN encoder-decoder for statistical machine translation\".
