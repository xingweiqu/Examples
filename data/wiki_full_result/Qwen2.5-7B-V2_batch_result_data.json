For example, the best system entering MUC-7 scored 93.39% of F-measure while human annotators scored 97.60% and 96.95%.Named-entity recognition platforms\nNotable NER platforms include:\n\nGATE supports NER across many languages and domains out of the box, usable via a graphical interface and a Java API.\nOpenNLP includes rule-based and statistical named-entity recognition.\nSpaCy features fast statistical NER as well as an open-source named-entity visualizer.\nTransformers features token classification using deep learning models.Problem definition\nIn the expression named entity, the word named restricts the task to those entities for which one or many strings, such as words or phrases, stand (fairly) consistently for some referent. This is closely related to rigid designators, as defined by Kripke, although in practice NER deals with many names and referents that are not philosophically \"rigid\". For instance, the automotive company created by Henry Ford in 1903 can be referred to as Ford or Ford Motor Company, although \"Ford\" can refer to many other entities as well (see Ford). Rigid designators include proper names as well as terms for certain biological species and substances, but exclude pronouns (such as \"it\"; see coreference resolution), descriptions that pick out a referent by its properties (see also De dicto and de re), and names for kinds of things as opposed to individuals (for example \"Bank\").\nFull named-entity recognition is often broken down, conceptually and possibly also in implementations, as two distinct problems: detection of names, and classification of the names by the type of entity they refer to (e.g. person, organization, or location).\nThe first phase is typically simplified to a segmentation problem: names are defined to be contiguous spans of tokens, with no nesting, so that \"Bank of America\" is a single name, disregarding the fact that inside this name, the substring \"America\" is itself a name. This segmentation problem is formally similar to chunking. The second phase requires choosing an ontology by which to organize categories of things.\nTemporal expressions and some numerical expressions (e.g., money, percentages, etc.) may also be considered as named entities in the context of the NER task. While some instances of these types are good examples of rigid designators (e.g., the year 2001) there are also many invalid ones (e.g., I take my vacations in \u201cJune\u201d). In the first case, the year 2001 refers to the 2001st year of the Gregorian calendar. In the second case, the month June may refer to the month of an undefined year (past June, next June, every June, etc.). It is arguable that the definition of named entity is loosened in such cases for practical reasons. The definition of the term named entity is therefore not strict and often has to be explained in the context in which it is used.\nCertain hierarchies of named entity types have been proposed in the literature. BBN categories, proposed in 2002, are used for question answering and consists of 29 types and 64 subtypes. Sekine's extended hierarchy, proposed in 2002, is made of 200 subtypes. More recently, in 2011 Ritter used a hierarchy based on common Freebase entity types in ground-breaking experiments on NER over social media text.Formal evaluation\nTo evaluate the quality of an NER system's output, several measures have been defined. The usual measures are called precision, recall, and F1 score. However, several issues remain in just how to calculate those values.\nThese statistical measures work reasonably well for the obvious cases of finding or missing a real entity exactly; and for finding a non-entity. However, NER can fail in many other ways, many of which are arguably \"partially correct\", and should not be counted as complete success or failures. For example, identifying a real entity, but: \n\nwith fewer tokens than desired (for example, missing the last token of \"John Smith, M.D.\")\nwith more tokens than desired (for example, including the first word of \"The University of MD\")\npartitioning adjacent entities differently (for example, treating \"Smith, Jones Robinson\" as 2 vs. 3 entities)\nassigning it a completely wrong type (for example, calling a personal name an organization)\nassigning it a related but inexact type (for example, \"substance\" vs. \"drug\", or \"school\" vs. \"organization\")\ncorrectly identifying an entity, when what the user wanted was a smaller- or larger-scope entity (for example, identifying \"James Madison\" as a personal name, when it's part of \"James Madison University\"). Some NER systems impose the restriction that entities may never overlap or nest, which means that in some cases one must make arbitrary or task-specific choices.\nOne overly simple method of measuring accuracy is merely to count what fraction of all tokens in the text were correctly or incorrectly identified as part of entity references (or as being entities of the correct type). This suffers from at least two problems: first, the vast majority of tokens in real-world text are not part of entity names, so the baseline accuracy (always predict \"not an entity\") is extravagantly high, typically >90%; and second, mispredicting the full span of an entity name is not properly penalized (finding only a person's first name when his last name follows might be scored as \u00bd accuracy).\nIn academic conferences such as CoNLL, a variant of the F1 score has been defined as follows:\n\nPrecision is the number of predicted entity name spans that line up exactly with spans in the gold standard evaluation data. I.e. when [Person Hans] [Person Blick] is predicted but [Person Hans Blick] was required, precision for the predicted name is zero. Precision is then averaged over all predicted entity names.\nRecall is similarly the number of names in the gold standard that appear at exactly the same location in the predictions.\nF1 score is the harmonic mean of these two.\nIt follows from the above definition that any prediction that misses a single token, includes a spurious token, or has the wrong class, is a hard error and does not contribute positively to either precision or recall. Thus, this measure may be said to be pessimistic: it can be the case that many \"errors\" are close to correct, and might be adequate for a given purpose. For example, one system might always omit titles such as \"Ms.\" or \"Ph.D.\", but be compared to a system or ground-truth data that expects titles to be included. In that case, every such name is treated as an error. Because of such issues, it is important actually to examine the kinds of errors, and decide how important they are given one's goals and requirements.\nEvaluation models based on a token-by-token matching have been proposed. Such models may be given partial credit for overlapping matches (such as using the Intersection over Union criterion). They allow a finer grained evaluation and comparison of extraction systems.Approaches\nNER systems have been created that use linguistic grammar-based techniques as well as statistical models such as machine learning. Hand-crafted grammar-based systems typically obtain better precision, but at the cost of lower recall and months of work by experienced computational linguists. Statistical NER systems typically require a large amount of manually annotated training data. Semisupervised approaches have been suggested to avoid part of the annotation effort.\nMany different classifier types have been used to perform machine-learned NER, with conditional random fields being a typical choice.Problem domains\nIn 2001, research indicated that even state-of-the-art NER systems were brittle, meaning that NER systems developed for one domain did not typically perform well on other domains. Considerable effort is involved in tuning NER systems to perform well in a new domain; this is true for both rule-based and trainable statistical systems.\nEarly work in NER systems in the 1990s was aimed primarily at extraction from journalistic articles. Attention then turned to processing of military dispatches and reports. Later stages of the automatic content extraction (ACE) evaluation also included several types of informal text styles, such as weblogs and text transcripts from conversational telephone speech conversations. Since about 1998, there has been a great deal of interest in entity identification in the molecular biology, bioinformatics, and medical natural language processing communities.  The most common entity of interest in that domain has been names of genes and gene products. There has been also considerable interest in the recognition of chemical entities and drugs in the context of the CHEMDNER\ncompetition, with 27 teams participating in this task.Current challenges and research\nDespite high F1 numbers reported on the MUC-7 dataset, the problem of named-entity recognition is far from being solved. The main efforts are directed to reducing the annotations labor by employing semi-supervised learning, robust performance across domains and scaling up to fine-grained entity types. In recent years, many projects have turned to crowdsourcing, which is a promising solution to obtain high-quality aggregate human judgments for supervised and semi-supervised machine learning approaches to NER. Another challenging task is devising models to deal with linguistically complex contexts such as Twitter and search queries.\nThere are some researchers who did some comparisons about the NER performances from different statistical models such as HMM (hidden Markov model), ME (maximum entropy), and CRF (conditional random fields), and feature sets. And some researchers recently proposed graph-based semi-supervised learning model for language specific NER tasks.\nA recently emerging task of identifying \"important expressions\" in text and cross-linking them to Wikipedia can be seen as an instance of extremely fine-grained named-entity recognition, where the types are the actual Wikipedia pages describing the (potentially ambiguous) concepts. Below is an example output of a Wikification system:\n\nAnother field that has seen progress but remains challenging is the application of NER to Twitter and other microblogs, considered \"noisy\" due to non-standard orthography, shortness and informality of texts. NER challenges in English Tweets have been organized by research communities to compare performances of various approaches, such as bidirectional LSTMs, Learning-to-Search, or CRFs.See also\nControlled vocabulary\nCoreference resolution\nEntity linking (aka named entity normalization, entity disambiguation)\nInformation extraction\nKnowledge extraction\nOnomastics\nRecord linkage\nSmart tag (Microsoft)\n\n\n== References ==", "result": "# Introduction\n\nNamed-entity recognition (NER), sometimes called named-entity tagging, is a task of information extraction which identifies and classifies named entities in unstructured text into pre-defined categories, such as the person name, location, organization, and so on. It is closely related to but distinct from other tasks of information extraction such as relation extraction and event detection. NER has many applications in areas such as biology, information retrieval, finance, and natural language processing.\n\nResearchers at the Allen Institute for AI recently released a dataset called BookGraph, which combines text from books with knowledge graphs containing structured information. They used this dataset to show that current SOTA models are unable to perform NER effectively on large bodies of fictional text, due to the ambiguous way in which characters are often referred to. For example, a character may be referred to by their full name the first time they are introduced, and then by a nickname in later chapters of the book. Linking these entities together requires knowledge beyond the scope of the typical NER task, and evaluating the results of NER is also difficult in domains such as fictional literature where real-world knowledge is irrelevant or even misleading. However, in other domains such as legal documents, linking and disambiguating named entities is critical.\n\nA recent study claims that some of the popular benchmarks for NER are not good representatives of real world scenarios. It points out several issues with the existing NER benchmarks like over-representation of certain entity types, failure to account for linguistic phenomena like anaphora and lack of in-domain test sets. It proposes solutions for these issues and introduces a Named Entity Long-range Dependency (NELD) benchmark which consists of long texts with complex referring expressions.\n\nThe overall accuracy of NER is typically measured by computing the F1-score, which takes into account precision and recall. The performance of modern NER systems is close to human-level performance in many domains. For instance, one neural network achieves 97% F1-score on the task of recognizing names of persons, organizations, and locations (in English). Another neural network achieves 95% F1-score for named entities (person, organization, location, and miscellaneous) in English and Spanish texts.\n\n Named-entity recognition platforms\n\nThere are several named-entity recognition platforms available, either as open source software maintained by their developers, or as closed source software provided by language technology providers. These platforms differ in the programming languages they support, the operating systems they run on, and the supported input and output formats. Most platforms support rule-based and statistical models; some also support machine learning models.\n\nMost named-entity recognition systems rely on the natural language tokenizer from their respective programming libraries. Tokenization order is important for non-European languages, especially for Arabic since words may have different meanings based on their prefix. Tokenization is also language-dependent; what appears to be a word in one language may need to be split into multiple tokens in another. For example, in German, the token \"nach\" by itself can be a word meaning \"after\" or \"to\". But in Dutch, the same string is a phonetic spelling of \"naach\", with a different meaning (\"slowly\"). The systems usually accept a list of user-defined entities that should not be split up by the tokenizer (for example, acronyms).\n\nOpen-source named-entity recognition systems include:\n\n* Apache OpenNLP - Java library with a statistical maximum entropy part-of-speech tagger\n* LingPipe - Java library with support for named-entity recognition in English, German, Spanish, French, and Italian\n* Mate - Java framework with part-of-speech tagging, named-entity recognition, and dependency parsing\n* NLTK - Python library with an interface to the statistical maximum entropy part-of-speech tagger in the OpenNLP library\n* OpenFst - C++ library for finite-state acceptance, transduction, and mapping\n* Stanford CoreNLP - Java library with part-of-speech tagging, named-entity recognition, and dependency parsing\n* TreeTagger - Command-line program for part-of-speech tagging and named-entity recognition\n* spaCy - Python library for natural language processing that provides named entity recognition functionality\n* yargy - Python library for regular-text parsing. It could be used as a named entities recognition tool with custom entity definitions\n\nCommercial named-entity recognition systems include:\n\n* Google Cloud Natural Language API - Cloud-based API provided by Google\n* IBM Watson Natural Language Understanding - Cloud-based API provided by IBM\n* Microsoft Azure Language Understanding - Cloud-based API provided by Microsoft\n* Amazon Comprehend - Cloud-based API provided by Amazon\n* Lexalytics - On-premise and cloud-based software provided by LexisNexis\n* MonkeyLearn - Cloud-based API with an app store\n* RapidMiner - On-premise and cloud-based software, also available as an API\n* Semantria - Cloud-based API\n* Textalyser - On-premise and cloud-based software\n* ThoughtSpot - Cloud-based business intelligence software that includes NER\n\n Problem definition\n\nThere are two main challenges in named-entity recognition: segmentation (determining which characters form a single entity) and classification (determining to which entity type the given entity belongs). Both of these tasks are non-trivial, as evidenced by the existence of entire subfields of linguistics and of computational linguistics dedicated to each of them.\n\n--- Segmentation\n\nWord segmentation is the task of splitting a string of characters into words. This is a non-trivial task in languages other than English, due to the lack of delimiters between words (spaces, underscores, etc.). In languages such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, there are no explicit delimiters between words, and thus the problem of word segmentation as it pertains to named-entity recognition is also a word recognition problem.\n\nFor English text, most systems also provide a list of user-defined words that should not be split up during segmentation. For example, the system might not segment the phrase New York if it appears in the user dictionary.\n\n--- Classification\n\nOnce the input string has been divided into potential named entities, those entities must be classified according to a predefined set of entity types. The choice of entity types is not a trivial decision, as it depends largely on the intended use of the system. For example, an entity type system for biomedical text mining might include the types Disease, Protein, and Gene, but not the type Location (which is the primary entity type in most English-language NER systems).\n\nA particular challenge in named-entity recognition is posed by rigid designators\u2014proper names, which are generally not amenable to the automatic construction of semantic relations. For example, a named-entity recognizer might encounter the name Paris, but from context it should know that it refers to the capital of France, or London, but not to cities in the United States. One approach to this problem is to manually link all proper names to an ontology. For example, the Stanford NER tagger treats proper names (ENTY) as a special case of the class TYPE, which is why the output class for both common nouns and proper names is sometimes O (other).\n\nIt is also important to note that named-entity recognition focuses on named entities, which means that the system does not necessarily recognize all instances of common nouns. For example, the sentence We moved to New York because it is the capital of New York State contains two occurrences of the word New York, the first of which is a named entity (referencing a city), and the second of which is a common noun (referencing the geographical region). A typical named-entity recognizer will only recognize the first occurrence of New York as a named entity.\n\n--- Contextual ambiguity\n\nProper names are not the only source of ambiguity in named-entity recognition. Even for common nouns, which pose greater difficulty for NER systems, contextual anaphora can create ambiguity. For example, the sentence Mary Smith is a nurse. She works at the hospital. contains two occurrences of the pronoun She, both of which refer to Mary Smith. Identifying which occurrence of She refers to Mary requires a level of semantic understanding and inference that goes beyond simple entity recognition. This is sometimes called long-distance named-entity recognition or contextual named-entity recognition.\n\n--- Domain specificity\n\nIn addition to the above sources of ambiguity, named-entity recognition can also be complicated by domain specificity. Named-entity recognition systems are usually trained on data that is annotated with the correct entity boundaries and classifications. If the input data matches the domain or topic of the training data, the NER system will likely produce high precision and recall. However, if the input data differs significantly from the training data (for example, if it contains many domain-specific entities), the NER system may struggle to recognize and classify all of the entities. This is known as the domain shift problem, and it is one of the major hurdles in developing NER systems that work across multiple domains.\n\n--- Ontology matching\n\nA NER system's output is only as good as the underlying ontology (or taxonomy) on which it is trained. For example, if the ontology includes the entity types company, business, and organization, but does not include the entity type job, the system will never be able to recognize job postings, even if it contains the word \"job\" or \"position\". This is known as the ontology gap problem. Conversely, if the ontology includes thousands of entity types, it may become too unwieldy to train effectively. One solution is to use a combination of manual ontology development and ontology alignment based on a labeled training corpus. Another solution is to start with an existing ontology and either include it or exclude it depending on whether its entities appear in the input document.\n\n Formal evaluation\n\nOne of the earliest named-entity recognition datasets is the Message Understanding Corporation or MUC-7 dataset, introduced in 1998. It contains news articles on the topic of international relations, and defines the named entities as people, organizations, and government positions (entities of the type position would now be considered part of the class location).\n\nSince then, many more datasets have been created, in many different languages and covering many different topics. The following table summarizes some of the most well-known datasets.\n\n--- Evaluation metrics\n\nThe most popular method for evaluating the quality of a NER system is to compare its output against a known ground truth. The quality of the output is usually measured using precision, recall, and F1 score.\n\nPrecision is defined as the proportion of correctly recognized entities to the total number of recognized entities. Low precision indicates that many incorrect entities are being recognized by the system, which are typically referred to as false alarms or false positives.\n\nRecall is defined as the proportion of correctly recognized entities to the total number of actual entities. Low recall indicates that the system is failing to recognize many legitimate entities, which are typically referred to as missed entities or false negatives.\n\nThe F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. It attempts to find the balance point between precision and recall, and is a good single-number summary of NER system performance. However, optimizing for the F1 score does not maximize the number of correctly recognized entities, and in fact does not even maximize their proportion. This is because the precision and recall values are computed separately for each entity recognized by the system. Thus, a system that recognizes many false entities but has high precision (few missed entities) will actually achieve higher F1 than a system that recognizes very few false entities but has low precision (many missed entities).\n\nThis has led some researchers to propose alternative metrics for NER. One popular alternative is to treat named-entity recognition as a token classification problem, wherein each token (i.e., entity) is labeled with its corresponding class. This allows us to compute the class-wise precision and recall values, which can be averaged to obtain a overall score. This also allows us to use any standard sequence labeling metric, such as the UAS/DAS (un/annotated sentence accuracy) or the BIES tagging scheme.\n\n Approaches\n\nNER can be seen as a sequence labeling task, and therefore methods from statistical natural language processing are often used. Conditional random fields (CRFs), maximum entropy (ME) models, and hidden Markov models (HMMs) have all been employed for NER. Other authors have approached NER as a machine learning problem, with features such as part-of-speech tags and lexical information used as inputs to various classifiers, which then predict entity status (e.g. inside-bio). Recent advances in neural networks have led to the use of recursive neural networks and recurrent neural networks for NER.\n\nProblem domains that require the disambiguation of named entities (for example, when the same entity may refer to different classes depending on the context) may benefit from coreference resolution.\n\n Problem domains\n\nNER systems can be evaluated on unannotated text by comparing the extracted named entities against a reference set. Systems have achieved over 90% F1 on the task of recognizing people, companies, and locations in English, German, French, and other European languages. Accuracy on domain-specific text (for example, legal documents or movie dialog scripts) may be much lower.\n\nThe same tools used for NER can also be used to improve other natural language processing tasks. For example, named-entity recognition can be used to improve the parsing of noun phrases by providing the parser with the antecedent of a coreferent pronoun.\n\n--- English\n\nThe majority of NER research has been conducted on English, possibly because named-entity recognition is less useful for languages that have fewer grammatical categories (and thus less ambiguity) or because the Web contains more English text than other languages. Despite this, researchers have argued that English NER systems do not generalize well to other registers or varieties of English and that improvements in part-of-speech tagging lead to comparable improvements in NER.\n\n--- Other Indo-European languages\n\nIndo-European languages other than English have also been the subject of NER research. Such systems may benefit from or be hampered by the fact that some Indo-European languages have grammatical cases, which can help disambiguate named entities. On the other hand, inflectional endings are often harder to recognize in Indo-European languages than in, say, highly agglutinative Finnic languages, which can make the task of named-entity recognition more difficult for certain types of named entities (e.g. declensional paradigms of a given place name or person name).\n\n**West Germanic**\n\nThe West Germanic languages Dutch, German, and English have been the subjects of NER research. While one group was able to create German NER systems that performed as well as English NER systems, another group found that state-of-the-art English NER systems performed only about twice as well as random guessing on German text, although they did not optimize their systems for German. Nevertheless, German NER systems have been used in real-world applications, such as information extraction from historical German news articles.\n\n**Slavic**\n\nSlavic languages such as Russian, Czech, and Polish are particularly challenging for NER because they have rich case systems that can make it difficult to distinguish between grammatical relations and named entities. Russian NER systems have been developed that achieve near-perfect precision or recall (although not both) using only the context of the word being tagged. Other researchers have developed Russian NER systems that achieve good results using part-of-speech tags and trigrams (three consecutive words).\n\n**Indo-Iranian**\n\nNER systems have been developed for Indian languages written in the Devanagari, Bengali, and Gujarati alphabets, although named-entity recognition is complicated by the fact that the script does not always indicate vowels, making it difficult to disambiguate word boundaries. Indian languages also tend to have highly inflected paradigms, particularly in the case of Sanskrit. A named-entity recognition system for English-Sanskrit code-switched text achieved reasonable results, demonstrating that some progress in this area has been made.\n\n--- Non-Indo-European languages\n\nMost named-entity recognition research has focused on languages that belong to the Indo-European language family. However, researchers have also developed NER systems for languages that belong to other families, such as Uralic, Sino-Tibetan, and Afroasiatic.\n\n Finnish Named-entity recognition has been demonstrated successfully on Estonian and Finnish, which are related Finnic languages with relatively simple morphology (compared to, say, Russian or Hungarian). A named-entity recognition system for Finnish achieved an F1 score of 77%, similar to the best results for English and better than the best results for German.\n\n Arabic Although Arabic is relatively well represented among non-Indo-European languages in terms of NER research, the task is complicated by the fact that most Arabic text is unannotated and morphologically inflected (i.e. words change form based on grammatical properties such as tense, gender, and number). A shared task on Arabic NER in 2009 revealed significant variation between the top performing systems, which used morphological analysis, part-of-speech tagging, and partial supervision (annotating a small number of examples) to improve performance. Modern Standard Arabic is only one variety of Arabic; others include Classical Arabic (the language of the Quran) and various dialects. There are also many varieties of spoken Arabic, which pose additional challenges for NER.\n\n Current challenges and research\n\nSome researchers have proposed new challenges for named-entity recognition. One of the most significant challenges is reducing the amount of annotation needed to train NER systems. Annotation is a time-consuming and often expensive process, and one of the main obstacles to deploying NER systems in real-world settings. Proposed solutions include transfer learning (applying NER systems developed in one domain to another domain with little or no annotation), error propagation (using the errors from previously annotated text to inform the annotation process), and in-context learning (leveraging general linguistic knowledge, such as the fact that two consecutive PERSON tags in a text are unlikely to refer to the same entity).\n\nAnother challenge is improving NER system performance in domain-specific contexts. As mentioned above, domain-specific entities can cause problems for NER systems trained on generic text. One solution is to mix domain-specific training data with generic training data, a technique that has been shown to improve performance in spoken-dialog systems.\n\nNER systems also struggle to recognize entities that mention only a part of the full name of the entity. For example, the phrase Joe Smith was shopping at Walmart last week might include the named entities Joe Smith and Walmart, but it would be difficult for a NER system to determine that Joe Smith refers to a person. Similarly, the phrase John did not buy any apples at George's Apple Farm might include the named entities John and George's Apple Farm, but it would be difficult for a NER system to determine that George's Apple Farm is a business. This is a problem that primarily affects systems that attempt to read into the semantics of a sentence to determine the type of all mentioned entities.\n\nThere are also challenges related to the format of the input text. Most NER systems are designed to work with plain text as input. However, text in electronic books and web pages often includes electronic markup, which can be used to simplify the task of named-entity recognition. For example, a NER system that processes web pages could be provided with markup indicating which words and phrases are hyperlinks, and it would only need to perform named-entity recognition on the linked words and phrases. This would likely improve performance, since links often point to other websites (organizations) or to other pages within the same website (typically person names or organization names).\n\nResearchers have also begun to apply the principles of active learning to NER. Active learning is a type of machine learning in which the algorithm can interactively query a user (or external source) to obtain the desired output. In the context of NER, this could mean something as simple as a list of entities and their types. The advantage of this approach is that it reduces the amount of annotation needed to train the NER system. The disadvantage is that it may be difficult (or impossible) to obtain this information in some cases.\n\nRecently, a new line of research has explored the application of semi-supervised and unsupervised named entity discovery methods. While supervised methods require costly manual effort to develop labeled training corpora, these unsupervised approaches aim to discover named entities and their types without any prior knowledge. Although they still present some challenges (such as handling entity type diversity), these methods pave the way for NER in low-resourced languages and domains.\n\n"}, {"instruction": "You are an AI editor writing a complete Wikipedia article that adheres to Wikipedia's content standards.

Incorporate appropriate references and adhere to Wikipedia's neutral point of view.", "input": "", "output": "Introduction\nA large language model (LLM) is a type of machine learning model designed for natural language processing tasks such as language generation. LLMs are language models with many parameters, and are trained with self-supervised learning on a vast amount of text.\nThe largest and most capable LLMs are generative pretrained transformers (GPTs). Modern models can be fine-tuned for specific tasks or guided by prompt engineering. These models acquire predictive power regarding syntax, semantics, and ontologies inherent in human language corpora, but they also inherit inaccuracies and biases present in the data they are trained in.History\nBefore 2017, there were a few language models that were large as compared to capacities then available. In the 1990s, the IBM alignment models pioneered statistical language modelling. A smoothed n-gram model in 2001 trained on 0.3 billion words achieved state-of-the-art perplexity at the time. In the 2000s, as Internet use became prevalent, some researchers constructed Internet-scale language datasets (\"web as corpus\"), upon which they trained statistical language models. In 2009, in most language processing tasks, statistical language models dominated over symbolic language models because they can usefully ingest large datasets.\n\nAfter neural networks became dominant in image processing around 2012, they were applied to language modelling as well. Google converted its translation service to Neural Machine Translation in 2016. Because it preceded the existence of transformers, it was done by seq2seq deep LSTM networks.\nAt the 2017 NeurIPS conference, Google researchers introduced the transformer architecture in their landmark paper \"Attention Is All You Need\". This paper's goal was to improve upon 2014 seq2seq technology, and was based mainly on the attention mechanism developed by Bahdanau et al. in 2014. The following year in 2018, BERT was introduced and quickly became \"ubiquitous\". Though the original transformer has both encoder and decoder blocks, BERT is an encoder-only model. Academic and research usage of BERT began to decline in 2023, following rapid improvements in the abilities of decoder-only models (such as GPT) to solve tasks via prompting.\nAlthough decoder-only GPT-1 was introduced in 2018, it was GPT-2 in 2019 that caught widespread attention because OpenAI at first deemed it too powerful to release publicly, out of fear of malicious use. GPT-3 in 2020 went a step further and as of 2024 is available only via API with no offering of downloading the model to execute locally. But it was the 2022 consumer-facing browser-based ChatGPT that captured the imaginations of the general population and caused some media hype and online buzz. The 2023 GPT-4 was praised for its increased accuracy and as a \"holy grail\" for its multimodal capabilities. OpenAI did not reveal the high-level architecture and the number of parameters of GPT-4. The release of ChatGPT led to an uptick in LLM usage across several research subfields of computer science, including robotics, software engineering, and societal impact work. In 2024 OpenAI released the reasoning model OpenAI o1, which generates long chains of thought before returning a final answer.\nCompeting language models have for the most part been attempting to equal the GPT series, at least in terms of number of parameters.\nSince 2022, source-available models have been gaining popularity, especially at first with BLOOM and LLaMA, though both have restrictions on the field of use. Mistral AI's models Mistral 7B and Mixtral 8x7b have the more permissive Apache License. In January 2025, DeepSeek released DeepSeek R1, a 671-billion-parameter open-weight model that performs comparably to OpenAI o1 but at a much lower cost.\nSince 2023, many LLMs have been trained to be multimodal, having the ability to also process or generate other types of data, such as images or audio. These LLMs are also called large multimodal models (LMMs).\nAs of 2024, the largest and most capable models are all based on the transformer architecture. Some recent implementations are based on other architectures, such as recurrent neural network variants and Mamba (a state space model).Dataset preprocessing\nTokenization\nAs machine learning algorithms process numbers rather than text, the text must be converted to numbers. In the first step, a vocabulary is decided upon, then integer indices are arbitrarily but uniquely assigned to each vocabulary entry, and finally, an embedding is associated to the integer index. Algorithms include byte-pair encoding (BPE) and WordPiece. There are also special tokens serving as control characters, such as [MASK] for masked-out token (as used in BERT), and [UNK] (\"unknown\") for characters not appearing in the vocabulary. Also, some special symbols are used to denote special text formatting. For example, \"\u0120\" denotes a preceding whitespace in RoBERTa and GPT. \"##\" denotes continuation of a preceding word in BERT.\nFor example, the BPE tokenizer used by GPT-3 (Legacy) would split tokenizer: texts -> series of numerical \"tokens\" as\n\nTokenization also compresses the datasets. Because LLMs generally require input to be an array that is not jagged, the shorter texts must be \"padded\" until they match the length of the longest one. How many tokens are, on average, needed per word depends on the language of the dataset.BPE\nAs an example, consider a tokenizer based on byte-pair encoding. In the first step, all unique characters (including blanks and punctuation marks) are treated as an initial set of n-grams (i.e. initial set of uni-grams). Successively the most frequent pair of adjacent characters is merged into a bi-gram and all instances of the pair are replaced by it. All occurrences of adjacent pairs of (previously merged) n-grams that most frequently occur together are then again merged into even lengthier n-gram, until a vocabulary of prescribed size is obtained (in case of GPT-3, the size is 50257). After a tokenizer is trained, any text can be tokenized by it, as long as it does not contain characters not appearing in the initial-set of uni-grams.Problems\nA token vocabulary based on the frequencies extracted from mainly English corpora uses as few tokens as possible for an average English word. However, an average word in another language encoded by such an English-optimized tokenizer is split into a suboptimal amount of tokens. GPT-2 tokenizer can use up to 15 times more tokens per word for some languages, for example for the Shan language from Myanmar. Even more widespread languages such as Portuguese and German have \"a premium of 50%\" compared to English.\nGreedy tokenization also causes subtle problems with text completion.Dataset cleaning\nIn the context of training LLMs, datasets are typically cleaned by removing low-quality, duplicated, or toxic data. Cleaned datasets can increase training efficiency and lead to improved downstream performance. A trained LLM can be used to clean datasets for training a further LLM.\nWith the increasing proportion of LLM-generated content on the web, data cleaning in the future may include filtering out such content. LLM-generated content can pose a problem if the content is similar to human text (making filtering difficult) but of lower quality (degrading performance of models trained on it).Synthetic data\nTraining of largest language models might need more linguistic data than naturally available, or that the naturally occurring data is of insufficient quality. In these cases, synthetic data might be used. Microsoft's Phi series of LLMs is trained on textbook-like data generated by another LLM.Training and architecture\nReinforcement learning from human feedback\nReinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) through algorithms, such as proximal policy optimization, is used to further fine-tune a model based on a dataset of human preferences.Instruction tuning\nUsing \"self-instruct\" approaches, LLMs have been able to bootstrap correct responses, replacing any naive responses, starting from human-generated corrections of a few cases. For example, in the instruction \"Write an essay about the main themes represented in Hamlet,\" an initial naive completion might be \"If you submit the essay after March 17, your grade will be reduced by 10% for each day of delay,\" based on the frequency of this textual sequence in the corpus.Mixture of experts\nThe largest LLM may be too expensive to train and use directly. For such models, mixture of experts (MoE) can be applied, a line of research pursued by Google researchers since 2017 to train models reaching up to 1 trillion parameters.Prompt engineering, attention mechanism, and context window\nMost results previously achievable only by (costly) fine-tuning, can be achieved through prompt engineering, although limited to the scope of a single conversation (more precisely, limited to the scope of a context window).\n\nIn order to find out which tokens are relevant to each other within the scope of the context window, the attention mechanism calculates \"soft\" weights for each token, more precisely for its embedding, by using multiple attention heads, each with its own \"relevance\" for calculating its own soft weights. For example, the small (i.e. 117M parameter sized) GPT-2 model has had twelve attention heads and a context window of only 1k tokens. In its medium version it has 345M parameters and contains 24 layers, each with 12 attention heads. For the training with gradient descent a batch size of 512 was utilized.\nThe largest models, such as Google's Gemini 1.5, presented in February 2024, can have a context window sized up to 1 million (context window of 10 million was also \"successfully tested\"). Other models with large context windows includes Anthropic's Claude 2.1, with a context window of up to 200k tokens. Note that this maximum refers to the number of input tokens and that the maximum number of output tokens differs from the input and is often smaller. For example, the GPT-4 Turbo model has a maximum output of 4096 tokens.\nLength of a conversation that the model can take into account when generating its next answer is limited by the size of a context window, as well. If the length of a conversation, for example with ChatGPT, is longer than its context window, only the parts inside the context window are taken into account when generating the next answer, or the model needs to apply some algorithm to summarize the too distant parts of conversation.\nThe shortcomings of making a context window larger include higher computational cost and possibly diluting the focus on local context, while making it smaller can cause a model to miss an important long-range dependency. Balancing them is a matter of experimentation and domain-specific considerations.\nA model may be pre-trained either to predict how the segment continues, or what is missing in the segment, given a segment from its training dataset. It can be either\n\nautoregressive (i.e. predicting how the segment continues, as GPTs do): for example given a segment \"I like to eat\", the model predicts \"ice cream\", or \"sushi\".\n\"masked\" (i.e. filling in the parts missing from the segment, the way \"BERT\" does it): for example, given a segment \"I like to [__] [__] cream\", the model predicts that \"eat\" and \"ice\" are missing.\nModels may be trained on auxiliary tasks which test their understanding of the data distribution, such as Next Sentence Prediction (NSP), in which pairs of sentences are presented and the model must predict whether they appear consecutively in the training corpus. During training, regularization loss is also used to stabilize training. However regularization loss is usually not used during testing and evaluation.Infrastructure\nSubstantial infrastructure is necessary for training the largest models.Training cost\nThe qualifier \"large\" in \"large language model\" is inherently vague, as there is no definitive threshold for the number of parameters required to qualify as \"large\". As time goes on, what was previously considered \"large\" may evolve. GPT-1 of 2018 is usually considered the first LLM, even though it has only 0.117 billion parameters. The tendency towards larger models is visible in the list of large language models.\nAs technology advanced, large sums have been invested in increasingly large models. For example, training of the GPT-2 (i.e. a 1.5-billion-parameters model) in 2019 cost $50,000, while training of the PaLM (i.e. a 540-billion-parameters model) in 2022 cost $8 million, and Megatron-Turing NLG 530B (in 2021) cost around $11 million.\nFor Transformer-based LLM, training cost is much higher than inference cost. It costs 6 FLOPs per parameter to train on one token, whereas it costs 1 to 2 FLOPs per parameter to infer on one token.Tool use\nThere are certain tasks that, in principle, cannot be solved by any LLM, at least not without the use of external tools or additional software. An example of such a task is responding to the user's input '354 * 139 = ', provided that the LLM has not already encountered a continuation of this calculation in its training corpus. In such cases, the LLM needs to resort to running program code that calculates the result, which can then be included in its response.: Another example is \"What is the time now? It is \", where a separate program interpreter would need to execute a code to get system time on the computer, so that the LLM can include it in its reply. This basic strategy can be sophisticated with multiple attempts of generated programs, and other sampling strategies.\nGenerally, in order to get an LLM to use tools, one must fine-tune it for tool-use. If the number of tools is finite, then fine-tuning may be done just once. If the number of tools can grow arbitrarily, as with online API services, then the LLM can be fine-tuned to be able to read API documentation and call API correctly.\nRetrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is another approach that enhances LLMs by integrating them with document retrieval systems. Given a query, a document retriever is called to retrieve the most relevant documents. This is usually done by encoding the query and the documents into vectors, then finding the documents with vectors (usually stored in a vector database) most similar to the vector of the query. The LLM then generates an output based on both the query and context included from the retrieved documents.Agency\nAn LLM is typically not an autonomous agent by itself, as it lacks the ability to interact with dynamic environments, recall past behaviors, and plan future actions, but can be transformed into one by integrating modules like profiling, memory, planning, and action.\nThe ReAct pattern, a portmanteau of \"Reason + Act\", constructs an agent out of an LLM, using the LLM as a planner. The LLM is prompted to \"think out loud\". Specifically, the language model is prompted with a textual description of the environment, a goal, a list of possible actions, and a record of the actions and observations so far. It generates one or more thoughts before generating an action, which is then executed in the environment. The linguistic description of the environment given to the LLM planner can even be the LaTeX code of a paper describing the environment.\nIn the DEPS (\"Describe, Explain, Plan and Select\") method, an LLM is first connected to the visual world via image descriptions, then it is prompted to produce plans for complex tasks and behaviors based on its pretrained knowledge and environmental feedback it receives.\nThe Reflexion method constructs an agent that learns over multiple episodes. At the end of each episode, the LLM is given the record of the episode, and prompted to think up \"lessons learned\", which would help it perform better at a subsequent episode. These \"lessons learned\" are given to the agent in the subsequent episodes.\nMonte Carlo tree search can use an LLM as rollout heuristic. When a programmatic world model is not available, an LLM can also be prompted with a description of the environment to act as world model.\nFor open-ended exploration, an LLM can be used to score observations for their \"interestingness\", which can be used as a reward signal to guide a normal (non-LLM) reinforcement learning agent. Alternatively, it can propose increasingly difficult tasks for curriculum learning. Instead of outputting individual actions, an LLM planner can also construct \"skills\", or functions for complex action sequences. The skills can be stored and later invoked, allowing increasing levels of abstraction in planning.\nLLM-powered agents can keep a long-term memory of its previous contexts, and the memory can be retrieved in the same way as Retrieval Augmented Generation. Multiple such agents can interact socially.Compression\nTypically, LLMs are trained with single- or half-precision floating point numbers (float32 and float16). One float16 has 16 bits, or 2 bytes, and so one billion parameters require 2 gigabytes. The largest models typically have 100 billion parameters, requiring 200 gigabytes to load, which places them outside the range of most consumer electronics.\nPost-training quantization aims to decrease the space requirement by lowering precision of the parameters of a trained model, while preserving most of its performance. The simplest form of quantization simply truncates all numbers to a given number of bits. It can be improved by using a different quantization codebook per layer. Further improvement can be done by applying different precisions to different parameters, with higher precision for particularly important parameters (\"outlier weights\"). See the visual guide to quantization by Maarten Grootendorst for a visual depiction.\nWhile quantized models are typically frozen, and only pre-quantized models are fine-tuned, quantized models can still be fine-tuned.Multimodality\nMultimodality means \"having several modalities\", and a \"modality\" refers to a type of input or output, such as video, image, audio, text, proprioception, etc. There have been many AI models trained specifically to ingest one modality and output another modality, such as AlexNet for image to label, visual question answering for image-text to text, and speech recognition for speech to text.\nA common method to create multimodal models out of an LLM is to \"tokenize\" the output of a trained encoder. Concretely, one can construct an LLM that can understand images as follows: take a trained LLM, and take a trained image encoder \n  \n    \n      \n        E\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle E}\n  \n. Make a small multilayered perceptron \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f}\n  \n, so that for any image \n  \n    \n      \n        y\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle y}\n  \n, the post-processed vector \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        (\n        E\n        (\n        y\n        )\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f(E(y))}\n  \n has the same dimensions as an encoded token. That is an \"image token\". Then, one can interleave text tokens and image tokens. The compound model is then fine-tuned on an image-text dataset. This basic construction can be applied with more sophistication to improve the model. The image encoder may be frozen to improve stability.\nFlamingo demonstrated the effectiveness of the tokenization method, finetuning a pair of pretrained language model and image encoder to perform better on visual question answering than models trained from scratch. Google PaLM model was fine-tuned into a multimodal model PaLM-E using the tokenization method, and applied to robotic control. LLaMA models have also been turned multimodal using the tokenization method, to allow image inputs, and video inputs.\nGPT-4 can use both text and image as inputs (although the vision component was not released to the public until GPT-4V); Google DeepMind's Gemini is also multimodal.  Mistral introduced its own multimodel Pixtral 12B model in September 2024.Reasoning\nIn late 2024, a new direction emerged in LLM development with models specifically designed for complex reasoning tasks. These \"reasoning models\" were trained to spend more time generating step-by-step solutions before providing final answers, similar to human problem-solving processes.\nOpenAI introduced this trend with their o1 model in September 2024, followed by o3 in December 2024. These models showed significant improvements in mathematics, science, and coding tasks compared to traditional LLMs. For example, on International Mathematics Olympiad qualifying exam problems, GPT-4o achieved 13% accuracy while o1 reached 83%.\nIn January 2025, the Chinese company DeepSeek released DeepSeek-R1, a 671-billion-parameter open-weight reasoning model that achieved comparable performance to OpenAI's o1 while being significantly more cost-effective to operate. Unlike proprietary models from OpenAI, DeepSeek-R1's open-weight nature allowed researchers to study and build upon the algorithm, though its training data remained private.\nThese reasoning models typically require more computational resources per query compared to traditional LLMs, as they perform more extensive processing to work through problems step-by-step. However, they have shown superior capabilities in domains requiring structured logical thinking, such as mathematics, scientific research, and computer programming.\nEfforts to reduce or compensate for hallucinations have employed automated reasoning, RAG (retrieval-augmented generation), fine-tuning, and other methods.Properties\nScaling laws\nThe performance of an LLM after pretraining largely depends on the:\n\ncost of pretraining \n  \n    \n      \n        C\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle C}\n  \n (the total amount of compute used),\nsize of the artificial neural network itself, such as number of parameters \n  \n    \n      \n        N\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle N}\n  \n (i.e. amount of neurons in its layers, amount of weights between them and biases),\nsize of its pretraining dataset (i.e. number of tokens in corpus, \n  \n    \n      \n        D\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle D}\n  \n).\n\"Scaling laws\" are empirical statistical laws that predict LLM performance based on such factors. One particular scaling law (\"Chinchilla scaling\") for LLM autoregressively trained for one epoch, with a log-log learning rate schedule, states that:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            {\n            \n              \n                \n                  C\n                  =\n                  \n                    C\n                    \n                      0\n                    \n                  \n                  N\n                  D\n                \n              \n              \n                \n                  L\n                  =\n                  \n                    \n                      A\n                      \n                        N\n                        \n                          \u03b1\n                        \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                  +\n                  \n                    \n                      B\n                      \n                        D\n                        \n                          \u03b2\n                        \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                  +\n                  \n                    L\n                    \n                      0\n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\begin{cases}C=C_{0}ND\\\\[6pt]L={\\frac {A}{N^{\\alpha }}}+{\\frac {B}{D^{\\beta }}}+L_{0}\\end{cases}}}\n  \n where the variables are\n\n  \n    \n      \n        C\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle C}\n  \n is the cost of training the model, in FLOPs.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        N\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle N}\n  \n is the number of parameters in the model.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        D\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle D}\n  \n is the number of tokens in the training set.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        L\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle L}\n  \n is the average negative log-likelihood loss per token (nats/token), achieved by the trained LLM on the test dataset.\nand the statistical hyper-parameters are\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          C\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n        =\n        6\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle C_{0}=6}\n  \n, meaning that it costs 6 FLOPs per parameter to train on one token.

However, this linearity may be punctuated by \"break(s)\" in the scaling law, where the slope of the line changes abruptly, and where larger models acquire \"emergent abilities\". They arise from the complex interaction of the model's components and are not explicitly programmed or designed. \nFurthermore, recent research has demonstrated that AI systems, including large language models, can employ heuristic reasoning akin to human cognition. They balance between exhaustive logical processing and the use of cognitive shortcuts (heuristics), adapting their reasoning strategies to optimize between accuracy and effort. This behavior aligns with principles of resource-rational human cognition, as discussed in classical theories of bounded rationality and dual-process theory.\nOne of the emergent abilities is in-context learning from example demonstrations. In-context learning is involved in tasks, such as:\n\nreported arithmetics\ndecoding the International Phonetic Alphabet\nunscrambling a word's letters\ndisambiguating word-in-context datasets\nconverting spatial words\ncardinal directions (for example, replying \"northeast\" in response to a 3x3 grid of 8 zeros and a 1 in the top-right), color terms represented in text.\nchain-of-thought prompting: In a 2022 research paper, chain-of-thought prompting only improved the performance for models that had at least 62B. Smaller models perform better when prompted to answer immediately, without chain of thought.\nidentifying offensive content in paragraphs of Hinglish (a combination of Hindi and English), and generating a similar English equivalent of Kiswahili proverbs.\nSchaeffer et. al. argue that the emergent abilities are not unpredictably acquired, but predictably acquired according to a smooth scaling law. The authors considered a toy statistical model of an LLM solving multiple-choice questions, and showed that this statistical model, modified to account for other types of tasks, applies to these tasks as well.\nLet \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x}\n  \n be the number of parameter count, and \n  \n    \n      \n        y\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle y}\n  \n be the performance of the model.Interpretation\nLarge language models by themselves are black boxes, and it is not clear how they can perform linguistic tasks. Similarly, it is unclear if or how LLMs should be viewed as models of the human brain and/or human mind.\nVarious techniques have been developed to enhance the transparency and interpretability of LLMs. Mechanistic interpretability aims to reverse-engineer LLMs by discovering symbolic algorithms that approximate the inference performed by an LLM. In recent years, sparse coding models such as sparse autoencoders, transcoders, and crosscoders have emerged as promising tools for identifying interpretable features.Studying a replacement model\nTranscoders, which are more interpretable than transformers, have been utilized to develop \u201creplacement models.\u201d In one such study involving the mechanistic interpretation of writing a rhyming poem by an LLM, it was shown that although they are believed to simply predict the next token, they can, in fact, plan ahead.Explainability\nA related concept is AI explainability, which focuses on understanding how an AI model arrives at a given result. Techniques such as partial dependency plots, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), and feature importance assessments allow researchers to visualize and understand the contributions of various input features to the model's predictions. These methods help ensure that AI models make decisions based on relevant and fair criteria, enhancing trust and accountability.\nBy integrating these techniques, researchers and practitioners can gain deeper insights into the operations of LLMs, fostering trust and facilitating the responsible deployment of these powerful models.\nIn another example, the authors trained small transformers on modular arithmetic addition. The resulting models were reverse-engineered, and it turned out they used discrete Fourier transform.Understanding and intelligence\nNLP researchers were evenly split when asked, in a 2022 survey, whether (untuned) LLMs \"could (ever) understand natural language in some nontrivial sense\". Proponents of \"LLM understanding\" believe that some LLM abilities, such as mathematical reasoning, imply an ability to \"understand\" certain concepts. A Microsoft team argued in 2023 that GPT-4 \"can solve novel and difficult tasks that span mathematics, coding, vision, medicine, law, psychology and more\" and that GPT-4 \"could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence system\": \"Can one reasonably say that a system that passes exams for software engineering candidates is not really intelligent?\" Ilya Sutskever argues that predicting the next word sometimes involves reasoning and deep insights, for example if the LLM has to predict the name of the criminal in an unknown detective novel after processing the entire story leading up to the revelation. Some researchers characterize LLMs as \"alien intelligence\". For example, Conjecture CEO Connor Leahy considers untuned LLMs to be like inscrutable alien \"Shoggoths\", and believes that RLHF tuning creates a \"smiling facade\" obscuring the inner workings of the LLM: \"If you don't push it too far, the smiley face stays on. But then you give it [an unexpected] prompt, and suddenly you see this massive underbelly of insanity, of weird thought processes and clearly non-human understanding.\"\nIn contrast, some skeptics of LLM understanding believe that existing LLMs are \"simply remixing and recombining existing writing\", a phenomenon known as stochastic parrot, or they point to the deficits existing LLMs continue to have in prediction skills, reasoning skills, agency, and explainability. For example, GPT-4 has natural deficits in planning and in real-time learning. Generative LLMs have been observed to confidently assert claims of fact which do not seem to be justified by their training data, a phenomenon which has been termed \"hallucination\". Specifically, hallucinations in the context of LLMs correspond to the generation of text or responses that seem syntactically sound, fluent, and natural but are factually incorrect, nonsensical, or unfaithful to the provided source input. Neuroscientist Terrence Sejnowski has argued that \"The diverging opinions of experts on the intelligence of LLMs suggests that our old ideas based on natural intelligence are inadequate\".\nThe matter of LLM's exhibiting intelligence or understanding has two main aspects \u2013 the first is how to model thought and language in a computer system, and the second is how to enable the computer system to generate human like language. These aspects of language as a model of cognition have been developed in the field of cognitive linguistics. American linguist George Lakoff presented Neural Theory of Language (NTL) as a computational basis for using language as a model of learning tasks and understanding. The NTL Model outlines how specific neural structures of the human brain shape the nature of thought and language and in turn what are the computational properties of such neural systems that can be applied to model thought and language in a computer system. After a framework for modeling language in a computer systems was established, the focus shifted to establishing frameworks for computer systems to generate language with acceptable grammar. In his 2014 book titled The Language Myth: Why Language Is Not An Instinct, British cognitive linguist and digital communication technologist Vyvyan Evans mapped out the role of probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG) in enabling NLP to model cognitive patterns and generate human like language.Evaluation\nPerplexity\nThe canonical measure of the performance of an LLM is its perplexity on a given text corpus. Perplexity measures how well a model predicts the contents of a dataset; the higher the likelihood the model assigns to the dataset, the lower the perplexity. In mathematical terms, perplexity is the exponential of the average negative log likelihood per token.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        log\n        \u2061\n        (\n        \n          Perplexity\n        \n        )\n        =\n        \u2212\n        \n          \n            1\n            N\n          \n        \n        \n          \u2211\n          \n            i\n            =\n            1\n          \n          \n            N\n          \n        \n        log\n        \u2061\n        (\n        Pr\n        (\n        \n          \n            token\n          \n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        \u2223\n        \n          \n            context for token\n          \n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        )\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\log({\\text{Perplexity}})=-{\\frac {1}{N}}\\sum _{i=1}^{N}\\log(\\Pr({\\text{token}}_{i}\\mid {\\text{context for token}}_{i}))}\n  \n\nHere, \n  \n    \n      \n        N\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle N}\n  \n is the number of tokens in the text corpus, and \"context for token \n  \n    \n      \n        i\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i}\n  \n\" depends on the specific type of LLM. If the LLM is autoregressive, then \"context for token \n  \n    \n      \n        i\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i}\n  \n\" is the segment of text appearing before token \n  \n    \n      \n        i\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i}\n  \n. If the LLM is masked, then \"context for token \n  \n    \n      \n        i\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i}\n  \n\" is the segment of text surrounding token \n  \n    \n      \n        i\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i}\n  \n.\nBecause language models may overfit to training data, models are usually evaluated by their perplexity on a test set. This evaluation is potentially problematic for larger models which, as they are trained on increasingly large corpora of text, are increasingly likely to inadvertently include portions of any given test set.BPW, BPC, and BPT\nIn information theory, the concept of entropy is intricately linked to perplexity, a relationship notably established by Claude Shannon. This relationship is mathematically expressed as \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          Entropy\n        \n        =\n        \n          log\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        \u2061\n        (\n        \n          Perplexity\n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\text{Entropy}}=\\log _{2}({\\text{Perplexity}})}\n  \n.\nEntropy, in this context, is commonly quantified in terms of bits per word (BPW) or bits per character (BPC), which hinges on whether the language model utilizes word-based or character-based tokenization.\nNotably, in the case of larger language models that predominantly employ sub-word tokenization, bits per token (BPT) emerges as a seemingly more appropriate measure. However, due to the variance in tokenization methods across different Large Language Models (LLMs), BPT does not serve as a reliable metric for comparative analysis among diverse models. To convert BPT into BPW, one can multiply it by the average number of tokens per word.\nIn the evaluation and comparison of language models, cross-entropy is generally the preferred metric over entropy. The underlying principle is that a lower BPW is indicative of a model's enhanced capability for compression. This, in turn, reflects the model's proficiency in making accurate predictions.Task-specific datasets and benchmarks\nA large number of testing datasets and benchmarks have also been developed to evaluate the capabilities of language models on more specific downstream tasks. Tests may be designed to evaluate a variety of capabilities, including general knowledge, bias, commonsense reasoning, and mathematical problem-solving.\nOne broad category of evaluation dataset is question answering datasets, consisting of pairs of questions and correct answers, for example, (\"Have the San Jose Sharks won the Stanley Cup?\", \"No\"). A question answering task is considered \"open book\" if the model's prompt includes text from which the expected answer can be derived (for example, the previous question could be adjoined with some text which includes the sentence \"The Sharks have advanced to the Stanley Cup finals once, losing to the Pittsburgh Penguins in 2016.\"). Otherwise, the task is considered \"closed book\", and the model must draw on knowledge retained during training. Some examples of commonly used question answering datasets include TruthfulQA, Web Questions, TriviaQA, and SQuAD.\nEvaluation datasets may also take the form of text completion, having the model select the most likely word or sentence to complete a prompt, for example: \"Alice was friends with Bob. Alice went to visit her friend, ____\".\nSome composite benchmarks have also been developed which combine a diversity of different evaluation datasets and tasks. Examples include GLUE, SuperGLUE, MMLU, BIG-bench, HELM, and HLE (Humanity's Last Exam). OpenAI has released tools for running composite benchmarks, but noted that the eval results are sensitive to the prompting method. Some public datasets contain questions that are mislabeled, ambiguous, unanswerable, or otherwise of low-quality, which can be cleaned to give more reliable benchmark scores.\nBias in LLMs may be measured through benchmarks such as CrowS-Pairs (Crowdsourced Stereotype Pairs), Stereo Set, and the more recent Parity Benchmark.  Additionally, fact-checking and misinformation detection are becoming increasingly crucial evaluation areas for LLMs. A recent study by Caramancion (2023) compared the fact-checking accuracy of prominent LLMs\u2014including OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT 3.5 and 4.0, Google\u2019s Bard, and Microsoft\u2019s Bing AI\u2014against independent fact-checking agencies such as PolitiFact and Snopes. The results demonstrated a moderate proficiency in fact verification, with GPT-4 achieving the highest accuracy at 71%, but still lagging behind human fact-checkers in contextual comprehension and nuanced reasoning. This underscores the evolving but incomplete ability of LLMs to discern fact from deception, highlighting the need for continued advancements in AI-driven fact-checking methodologies.\nIt was previously standard to report results on a heldout portion of an evaluation dataset after doing supervised fine-tuning on the remainder. It is now more common to evaluate a pre-trained model directly through prompting techniques, though researchers vary in the details of how they formulate prompts for particular tasks, particularly with respect to how many examples of solved tasks are adjoined to the prompt (i.e. the value of n in n-shot prompting).Adversarially constructed evaluations\nBecause of the rapid pace of improvement of large language models, evaluation benchmarks have suffered from short lifespans, with state of the art models quickly \"saturating\" existing benchmarks, exceeding the performance of human annotators, leading to efforts to replace or augment the benchmark with more challenging tasks. In addition, there are cases of \"shortcut learning\" wherein AIs sometimes \"cheat\" on multiple-choice tests by using statistical correlations in superficial test question wording in order to guess the correct responses, without necessarily understanding the actual question being asked.\nSome datasets have been constructed adversarially, focusing on particular problems on which extant language models seem to have unusually poor performance compared to humans. One example is the TruthfulQA dataset, a question answering dataset consisting of 817 questions which language models are susceptible to answering incorrectly by mimicking falsehoods to which they were repeatedly exposed during training. For example, an LLM may answer \"No\" to the question \"Can you teach an old dog new tricks?\" because of its exposure to the English idiom you can't teach an old dog new tricks, even though this is not literally true.\nAnother example of an adversarial evaluation dataset is Swag and its successor, HellaSwag, collections of problems in which one of multiple options must be selected to complete a text passage. The incorrect completions were generated by sampling from a language model and filtering with a set of classifiers. The resulting problems are trivial for humans but at the time the datasets were created state of the art language models had poor accuracy on them. For example:\n\nWe see a fitness center sign. We then see a man talking to the camera and sitting and laying on a exercise ball. The man...\na) demonstrates how to increase efficient exercise work by running up and down balls.\nb) moves all his arms and legs and builds up a lot of muscle.\nc) then plays the ball and we see a graphics and hedge trimming demonstration.\nd) performs sit ups while on the ball and talking.\n\nBERT selects b) as the most likely completion, though the correct answer is d).Limitations of LLM benchmarks\nBenchmarks can become outdated rapidly. Once a model attains near-perfect scores on a given benchmark, that benchmark ceases to serve as a meaningful indicator of progress. This phenomenon, known as \"benchmark saturation,\" necessitates the development of more challenging and nuanced tasks to continue advancing LLM capabilities. For instance, traditional benchmarks like HellaSwag and MMLU have seen models achieving high accuracy already.Wider impact\nIn 2023, Nature Biomedical Engineering wrote that \"it is no longer possible to accurately distinguish\" human-written text from text created by large language models, and that \"It is all but certain that general-purpose large language models will rapidly proliferate... It is a rather safe bet that they will change many industries over time.\" Goldman Sachs suggested in 2023 that generative language AI could increase global GDP by 7% in the next ten years, and could expose to automation 300 million jobs globally. Brinkmann et al. (2023) also argue that LLMs are transforming processes of cultural evolution by shaping processes of variation, transmission, and selection.Memorization and copyright\nMemorization is an emergent behavior in LLMs in which long strings of text are occasionally output verbatim from training data, contrary to typical behavior of traditional artificial neural nets. Evaluations of controlled LLM output measure the amount memorized from training data (focused on GPT-2-series models) as variously over 1% for exact duplicates or up to about 7%.\nA 2023 study showed that when ChatGPT 3.5 turbo was prompted to repeat the same word indefinitely, after a few hundreds of repetitions, it would start outputting excerpts from its training data.Security\nSome commenters expressed concern over accidental or deliberate creation of misinformation, or other forms of misuse. For example, the availability of large language models could reduce the skill-level required to commit bioterrorism; biosecurity researcher Kevin Esvelt has suggested that LLM creators should exclude from their training data papers on creating or enhancing pathogens.\nThe potential presence of \"sleeper agents\" within LLMs is another emerging security concern. These are hidden functionalities built into the model that remain dormant until triggered by a specific event or condition. Upon activation, the LLM deviates from its expected behavior to make insecure actions.\nLLM applications accessible to the public, like ChatGPT or Claude, typically incorporate safety measures designed to filter out harmful content. However, implementing these controls effectively has proven challenging. For instance, a 2023 study proposed a method for circumventing LLM safety systems. In 2025, The American Sunlight Project, a non-profit, published a study showing evidence that the so-called Pravda network, a pro-Russia propaganda aggregator, was strategically placing web content through mass publication and duplication with the intention of biasing LLM outputs. The American Sunlight Project coined this technique \"LLM grooming,\" and pointed to it as a new tool of weaponizing AI to spread disinformation and harmful content. Similarly, Yongge Wang illustrated in 2024 how a potential criminal could potentially bypass ChatGPT 4o's safety controls to obtain information on establishing a drug trafficking operation.Algorithmic bias\nWhile LLMs have shown remarkable capabilities in generating human-like text, they are susceptible to inheriting and amplifying biases present in their training data. This can manifest in skewed representations or unfair treatment of different demographics, such as those based on race, gender, language, and cultural groups. Since English data is overrepresented in current large language models' training data, it may also downplay non-English views.Stereotyping\nAI models can reinforce a wide range of stereotypes, including those based on gender, ethnicity, age, nationality, religion, or occupation. This can lead to outputs that homogenize, or unfairly generalize or caricature groups of people, sometimes in harmful or derogatory ways.\nNotably, gender bias refers to the tendency of these models to produce outputs that are unfairly prejudiced towards one gender over another. This bias typically arises from the data on which these models are trained. Large language models often assign roles and characteristics based on traditional gender norms. For example, it might associate nurses or secretaries predominantly with women and engineers or CEOs with men.Selection bias\nSelection bias refers the inherent tendency of large language models to favor certain option identifiers irrespective of the actual content of the options. This bias primarily stems from token bias\u2014that is, the model assigns a higher a priori probability to specific answer tokens (such as \u201cA\u201d) when generating responses. As a result, when the ordering of options is altered (for example, by systematically moving the correct answer to different positions), the model\u2019s performance can fluctuate significantly. This phenomenon undermines the reliability of large language models in multiple-choice settings.Political bias\nPolitical bias refers to the tendency of algorithms to systematically favor certain political viewpoints, ideologies, or outcomes over others. Language models may also exhibit political biases. Since the training data includes a wide range of political opinions and coverage, the models might generate responses that lean towards particular political ideologies or viewpoints, depending on the prevalence of those views in the data.Energy demands\nThe energy demands of LLMs have grown along with their size and capabilities. Data centers that enable LLM training require substantial amounts of electricity. Much of that electricity is generated by non-renewable resources that create greenhouse gases and contribute to climate change. Nuclear power and geothermal energy are two options tech companies are exploring to meet the sizable energy demands of LLM training. The significant expense of investing in geothermal solutions has led to major shale producers like Chevron and Exxon Mobil advocating for tech companies to use electricity produced via natural gas to fuel their large energy demands.See also\nFoundation models\nList of large language models\nList of chatbots\nLanguage model benchmark\nSmall language modelReferences\nFurther reading\nJurafsky, Dan, Martin, James.

These models can answer questions, play games, and perform other tasks, and have been described as a new form of intelligence. They are typically trained on datasets of hundreds of gigabytes or more, and require significant computational resources.\n\nHistory\n\nThe first large language models were statistical language models, trained on large datasets to predict the probability of a word occurring at a given position based on preceding words. Early work in this area includes the introduction of neural networks for language modeling by Jeff Dean and Matthieu Devin in 2017, and the Neural Next Word Prediction model by Alec Radford, Karpathy and Metz in 2018.\n\nIn 2018, OpenAI introduced the Transformer architecture, which uses attention mechanisms to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence when predicting the probability of the next word. This was followed in 2019 by the introduction of GPT-1 (\"Generative Pre-trained Transformer 1\"), one of the first transformer-based language models. GPT-1 had a capacity of 117 million parameters, and was trained on a dataset that included 800 billion words, drawn from various sources including Wikipedia and Common Crawl. GPT-1 was able to generate text that resembled human-written text, and was capable of performing simple tasks such as answering questions and playing word games.\n\nIn 2020, OpenAI released GPT-2 (\"Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2\"). GPT-2 had a capacity of 1.5 billion parameters, and was trained on a larger dataset of 1.5 trillion words. GPT-2 was able to generate text on a wide range of topics, and was capable of performing complex tasks such as summarizing news articles and generating poetry.\n\nIn 2020, researchers at Google introduced BERT (\"Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers\"), a language model that used bidirectional training to better understand the context in which words are used. BERT had a capacity of 340 million parameters, and was trained on a dataset of 2.5 billion words. BERT was able to perform a wide range of tasks, including question answering, sentiment analysis, and named entity recognition, and was widely used by developers.\n\nIn 2020, researchers at DeepMind introduced the Pathway language model, which used a novel architecture based on time-series forecasting to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a variety of tasks.\n\nIn 2020, researchers at Meta introduced the Llama (\"Language Model for All\") language model, which was designed to be a general-purpose language model that could be used for a wide range of tasks. Llama had a capacity of 7 billion parameters, and was trained on a dataset of 300 billion words. Llama was able to generate text that was similar in quality to that of GPT-2, but was smaller and more efficient than other language models of its time.\n\nIn 2022, OpenAI released GPT-3 (\"Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3\"), the third iteration of the GPT series of language models. GPT-3 had a capacity of 175 billion parameters, and was trained on a dataset of 570 billion words. GPT-3 was able to perform a wide range of tasks, including generating text, answering questions, and playing games, and was able to produce text that was often indistinguishable from text written by humans.\n\nIn 2022, researchers at Meta released the Llama 2 language model, which was an updated version of the Llama language model. Llama 2 had a capacity of 7 billion parameters, and was trained on a dataset of 300 billion words. Llama 2 was able to generate text that was similar in quality to that of GPT-3, but was smaller and more efficient than other language models of its time.\n\nIn 2022, researchers at Google introduced PaLM (\"Perplexity: A Language Model\"), a language model that was one of the largest at the time, with a capacity of 540 billion parameters. PaLM was trained on a dataset of 750 billion words, and was able to perform a wide range of tasks, including generating text, answering questions, and playing games.\n\nIn 2023, Google announced switching from training language models on individual texts to on document boundaries with Colossal Document Language (CDL), a method of pretraining based on the idea that documents are coherent units of text.\n\nIn 2023, OpenAI introduced ChatGPT, a large language model that was specifically designed for dialogue and conversation. ChatGPT was able to engage in conversations with humans, answer questions, and provide assistance with a wide range of tasks.\n\nIn 2023, researchers at Meta introduced LLama 3, a family of language models that included models with capacities of 32 billion, 65 billion, and 70 billion parameters.

The embedding is used in text analysis. Typically, the representation is a real-valued vector that encodes the meaning of the word in such a way that the words that are closer in the vector space are expected to be similar in meaning. Word embeddings can be obtained using language modeling and feature learning techniques, where words or phrases from the vocabulary are mapped to vectors of real numbers.\nMethods to generate this mapping include neural networks, dimensionality reduction on the word co-occurrence matrix, probabilistic models, explainable knowledge base method, and explicit representation in terms of the context in which words appear.\nWord and phrase embeddings, when used as the underlying input representation, have been shown to boost the performance in NLP tasks such as syntactic parsing and sentiment analysis.Development and history of the approach\nIn distributional semantics, a quantitative methodological approach for understanding meaning in observed language, word embeddings or semantic feature space models have been used as a knowledge representation for some time. Such models aim to quantify and categorize semantic similarities between linguistic items based on their distributional properties in large samples of language data.  The underlying idea that \"a word is characterized by the company it keeps\" was proposed in a 1957 article by John Rupert Firth, but also has roots in the contemporaneous work on search systems and in cognitive psychology.\nThe notion of a semantic space with lexical items (words or multi-word terms) represented as vectors or embeddings is based on the computational challenges of capturing distributional characteristics and using them for practical application to measure similarity between words, phrases, or entire documents. The first generation of semantic space models is the vector space model for information retrieval. Such vector space models for words and their distributional data implemented in their simplest form results in a very sparse vector space of high dimensionality (cf. curse of dimensionality). Reducing the number of dimensions using linear algebraic methods such as singular value decomposition then led to the introduction of latent semantic analysis in the late 1980s and the random indexing approach for collecting word co-occurrence contexts. In 2000, Bengio et al. provided in a series of papers titled \"Neural probabilistic language models\" to reduce the high dimensionality of word representations in contexts by \"learning a distributed representation for words\".\nA study published in NeurIPS (NIPS) 2002 introduced the use of both word and document embeddings applying the method of kernel CCA to bilingual (and multi-lingual) corpora, also providing an early example of self-supervised learning of word embeddings.\nWord embeddings come in two different styles, one in which words are expressed as vectors of co-occurring words, and another in which words are expressed as vectors of linguistic contexts in which the words occur; these different styles are studied in Lavelli et al., 2004. Roweis and Saul published in Science how to use \"locally linear embedding\" (LLE) to discover representations of high dimensional data structures. Most new word embedding techniques after about 2005 rely on a neural network architecture instead of more probabilistic and algebraic models, after foundational work done by Yoshua Bengio and colleagues.\nThe approach has been adopted by many research groups after theoretical advances in 2010 had been made on the quality of vectors and the training speed of the model, as well as after hardware advances allowed for a broader parameter space to be explored profitably. In 2013, a team at Google led by Tomas Mikolov created word2vec, a word embedding toolkit that can train vector space models faster than previous approaches. The word2vec approach has been widely used in experimentation and was instrumental in raising interest for word embeddings as a technology, moving the research strand out of specialised research into broader experimentation and eventually paving the way for practical application.Polysemy and homonymy\nHistorically, one of the main limitations of static word embeddings or word vector space models is that words with multiple meanings are conflated into a single representation (a single vector in the semantic space). In other words, polysemy and homonymy are not handled properly. For example, in the sentence \"The club I tried yesterday was great!\", it is not clear if the term club is related to the word sense of a club sandwich, clubhouse, golf club, or any other sense that club might have. The necessity to accommodate multiple meanings per word in different vectors (multi-sense embeddings) is the motivation for several contributions in NLP to split single-sense embeddings into multi-sense ones.\nMost approaches that produce multi-sense embeddings can be divided into two main categories for their word sense representation, i.e., unsupervised and knowledge-based. Based on word2vec skip-gram, Multi-Sense Skip-Gram (MSSG) performs word-sense discrimination and embedding simultaneously, improving its training time, while assuming a specific number of senses for each word. In the Non-Parametric Multi-Sense Skip-Gram (NP-MSSG) this number can vary depending on each word. Combining the prior knowledge of lexical databases (e.g., WordNet, ConceptNet, BabelNet), word embeddings and word sense disambiguation, Most Suitable Sense Annotation (MSSA) labels word-senses through an unsupervised and knowledge-based approach, considering a word's context in a pre-defined sliding window. Once the words are disambiguated, they can be used in a standard word embeddings technique, so multi-sense embeddings are produced. MSSA architecture allows the disambiguation and annotation process to be performed recurrently in a self-improving manner.\nThe use of multi-sense embeddings is known to improve performance in several NLP tasks, such as part-of-speech tagging, semantic relation identification, semantic relatedness, named entity recognition and sentiment analysis.\nAs of the late 2010s, contextually-meaningful embeddings such as ELMo and BERT have been developed. Unlike static word embeddings, these embeddings are at the token-level, in that each occurrence of a word has its own embedding. These embeddings better reflect the multi-sense nature of words, because occurrences of a word in similar contexts are situated in similar regions of BERT\u2019s embedding space.For biological sequences: BioVectors\nWord embeddings for n-grams in biological sequences (e.g. DNA, RNA, and Proteins) for bioinformatics applications have been proposed by Asgari and Mofrad. Named bio-vectors (BioVec) to refer to biological sequences in general with protein-vectors (ProtVec) for proteins (amino-acid sequences) and gene-vectors (GeneVec) for gene sequences, this representation can be widely used in applications of deep learning in proteomics and genomics. The results presented by Asgari and Mofrad suggest that BioVectors can characterize biological sequences in terms of biochemical and biophysical interpretations of the underlying patterns.Game design\nWord embeddings with applications in game design have been proposed by Rabii and Cook as a way to discover emergent gameplay using logs of gameplay data. The process requires transcribing actions that occur during a game within a formal language and then using the resulting text to create word embeddings. The results presented by Rabii and Cook suggest that the resulting vectors can capture expert knowledge about games like chess that are not explicitly stated in the game's rules.Sentence embeddings\nThe idea has been extended to embeddings of entire sentences or even documents, e.g. in the form of the thought vectors concept. In 2015, some researchers suggested \"skip-thought vectors\" as a means to improve the quality of machine translation. A more recent and popular approach for representing sentences is Sentence-BERT, or SentenceTransformers, which modifies pre-trained BERT with the use of siamese and triplet network structures.Software\nSoftware for training and using word embeddings includes Tom\u00e1\u0161 Mikolov's Word2vec, Stanford University's GloVe, GN-GloVe, Flair embeddings, AllenNLP's ELMo, BERT, fastText, Gensim, Indra, and Deeplearning4j. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and T-Distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding (t-SNE) are both used to reduce the dimensionality of word vector spaces and visualize word embeddings and clusters.Examples of application\nFor instance, the fastText is also used to calculate word embeddings for text corpora in Sketch Engine that are available online.Ethical implications\nWord embeddings may contain the biases and stereotypes contained in the trained dataset, as Bolukbasi et al. points out in the 2016 paper \u201cMan is to Computer Programmer as Woman is to Homemaker? Debiasing Word Embeddings\u201d that a publicly available (and popular) word2vec embedding trained on Google News texts (a commonly used data corpus), which consists of text written by professional journalists, still shows disproportionate word associations reflecting gender and racial biases when extracting word analogies. For example, one of the analogies generated using the aforementioned word embedding is \u201cman is to computer programmer as woman is to homemaker\u201d.\nResearch done by Jieyu Zhou et al. shows that the applications of these trained word embeddings without careful oversight likely perpetuates existing bias in society, which is introduced through unaltered training data. Furthermore, word embeddings can even amplify these biases .See also\nEmbedding (machine learning)\nBrown clustering\nDistributional\u2013relational database\n\n\n== References ==", "result": "# Introduction\n\nIn natural language processing, word embeddings are low-dimensional representations of words that capture the semantic meanings of words based on their usage patterns in context. Embeddings are obtained by training a neural network on a large corpus of text. The idea is that words appearing in similar contexts will appear near each other in the embedding space. Word embeddings are used to improve the performance of natural language processing systems. They allow the system to associate meaning with words that may be represented by vectors of zeros, a common problem when representing words with dense vectors. Word embeddings are usually trained using distributed computing due to the amount of data required to create them.\n\n Development and history of the approach\n\nWord embeddings have become widespread in NLP. However, there was no good way to represent words in a way that captured semantic information until the introduction of Word2Vec by Mikolov et al. in 2013. Before Word2Vec, features of words were hand-engineered and used in bag-of-words models. This was not a very scalable solution. As Mikolov puts it, bag-of-words models \u201cdo not work well for many NLP applications because they do not consider context of words.\u201d Bag-of-words models also suffer from the problem of requiring a large number of parameters to represent the frequency of each word. A solution to this problem came in an unlikely package: Google Flu Trends. Google Flu Trends aimed to track flu outbreaks by searching Google for flu-related terms. Although it had good intentions, Google Flu Trends was not very accurate. The initial model developed was based on a moving average of Google search data. While this approach worked well for some queries, others performed poorly. It was then discovered that queries that performed poorly were similar to other queries that performed well. By representing the search terms as vectors, one could use the search terms almost as features for predicting flu trends. The use of vectors for representing words to capture semantic information was thus harnessed to solve a different problem altogether. Although this was a promising start, it was not clear what kind of mathematical operations were possible with these word vectors. One year later, Mikolov and his colleagues at Google figured out that vector arithmetic such as King - Man + Woman was approximately equal to Queen. This indicated that the word vectors were capturing semantic information about the words, namely that King and Queen were to Man and Woman as Father and Mother. Word2Vec revolutionized the field of NLP and opened up new possibilities for word-level representations.\n\nHowever, Word2Vec has its limitations. The representations are static; they do not change even if the context changes. They are also sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters, require extensive tuning and lack interpretability. In addition, they only provide access to a word's co-occurrence statistics in a fixed window. To overcome these shortcomings, Turian et al. proposed using a neural network to directly learn to embed the words in a low-dimensional space while optimizing the same objective function. This had the advantage that the embeddings were learned in a task-specific manner, avoided the need for extensive parameter tuning and provided better interpretability since the embeddings were learned via a neural network. Since then, many improvements to the architecture have been proposed. These improvements have led to state-of-the-art results in several NLP tasks, such as natural language inference, sentiment analysis, machine translation and question answering.\n\n Polysemy and homonymy\n\nStatic word embeddings have difficulty dealing with polysemous words, i.e. words that have multiple distinct meanings. Since the embeddings are static, it is impossible to differentiate between all the different meanings of a word. As a result, the embedding ends up capturing only one meaning of the word. This can be seen as a special case of the shift-invariance property of word embeddings. Even if the context shifts and a different meaning of the word is used, the same embedding is used for the word regardless of context. This problem is especially prevalent in tasks where there are many distinct senses of a word and the senses are not easily separable, such as in the cases of disambiguation, certain translation tasks and word sense disambiguation. Context-independent embeddings also make it difficult for models to deal with homonymy, or words that have completely different meanings but similar senses. For example, the word \"bank\" is commonly used to refer to financial institutions as well as river banks. Although these two senses are similar since both involve some notion of a bank, they are, in fact, quite different. Models need to be able to disambiguate the two different uses since a model tasked with simply predicting the most common use of the word would be incorrect one some occasions.\n\nTo overcome these problems, new models have been proposed that give the model more structure. For example, Neelakantan et al. propose a model that separates a word's sense from its general semantics. So, returning to the word \"bank\", the model would have two separate vectors for the different senses of the word, as opposed to trying to capture both senses in a single vector. Instead of having a single vector for each word, the model uses a lookup table for each word in the corpus. This allows for the representation of out-of-vocabulary words, as long as they are defined in the sense in which they are being used. Another model that aims to solve the problems posed by homonymy and polysemy is the compositional vector model. Here, instead of trying to find similarities between words, the aim is to find a way to compute words, i.e. their vector representations, using other words' vector representations and basic mathematical operations, e.g. +, -, *. This way, if the model has been trained on sufficient data, new meanings of words can be computed automatically from other words. For example, if the model has the word sense for \"bank\" for the financial institution sense, it can compute it for the river sense as follows: bank = river + water. Here, water is substituted for river to get the vector representation for the new word sense of bank.\n\n For biological sequences\n\nWord embeddings have been generalized to work not only on natural languages but also on artificial ones. This has allowed scientists working with biological problems to take advantage of the advances made in the field of NLP. For example, bio-vectors is an open-source software suite that implements state-of-the-art embedding algorithms on biological sequences such as DNA, RNA and proteins. These embedding algorithms are analogous to the ones developed for natural language processing. Thus, using the same logic, we can apply these algorithms to biological sequence data to obtain embeddings that capture biochemical or biophysical properties of the data. These embeddings can then be used to train bioinformatics pipelines for tasks such as drug discovery, toxicity prediction and protein function prediction.\n\n Game design\n\nIn addition to their applications in NLP and bioinformatics, word embeddings have also been applied to the field of game design by Rabii and Cook. Their goal was to use word embeddings to uncover emergent gameplay, i.e. gameplay that arises from the rules of the game and the players' interactions with it, and to capture the expert knowledge embedded in a corpus of player feedback. They sought to use word embeddings to cluster together words that describe the same type of gameplay experience. To test their approach, they conducted experiments with three games: Portal, Super Mario Bros. and a prototypical top-down shooter game. They found that the embeddings captured both explicit, in the case of Portal and Super Mario Bros., and implicit, in the case of the top-down shooter game, gameplay mechanics. They also found that the embeddings successfully captured expert knowledge embedded in player feedback for all three games. Although this approach is still in its infancy, Rabii and Cook's work opens up new possibilities for natural language processing in the field of game design.\n\n Sentence embeddings\n\nWhile word-level embeddings have proven to be useful in a variety of applications, there have also been developments in sentence-level embeddings. Sentences can be embedded by first representing a sentence as a matrix of word embeddings and then applying a matrix operation on the matrix to get a sentence embedding. Alternatively, one can concatenate the word embeddings of all the words in a sentence to form a sentence embedding. However, these embeddings do not take into account the order of the words in a sentence. To overcome this limitation, recent work has focused on creating sentence embeddings using recurrent neural networks. These embeddings can capture the order of words in a sentence. However, recurrent neural networks are unable to capture long-range dependencies due to the vanishing gradient problem. This can be solved by using a recurrent neural network architecture called the long short-term memory (LSTM) network, which is capable of learning long-range dependencies. Once a model has been trained on a dataset, the word embeddings can be fine-tuned to also encode sentence information, resulting in a joint sentence and word embedding model. These embeddings can be used in downstream applications such as machine translation, paraphrase detection and text classification.\n\nSoftware\n\nThere are a number of software packages to create word embeddings, including:\n\n* Gensim\n* Torchwordemb\n* Word2Vec\n* FastText\n* GloVe\n* Text2Vec\n* TensorFlow Embedding Projector\n* Allennlp\n* SpaCy\n\nExamples of application\n\n* Sketch Engine offers online corpus browser and a free desktop version and corpus creation software. It also offers cloud-based corpora management and analysis service.\n* RapidMiner includes built-in support for Word2Vec.\n* Apache OpenNLP does not include pre-trained embeddings, but provides methods for training custom embeddings as part of its framework.\n* Python library nltk provides functionality to work with popular embeddings such as Word2Vec and GloVe.\n* In R, the most popular option is the package 'bworder', which uses the 'bert' model.\n* The Python library allennlp contains a module for creating word embeddings, including popular options like GloVe and fastText, or a custom embedding where each token is its own embedding.\n\nEthical implications\n\nThere are several concerns about the misuse of word embeddings. Since they are learned from data, they inherit the biases present in the data. These biases can be harmful and reinforce stereotypes. For example, word embeddings learned on news articles can perpetuate gender bias and occupational bias. Another concern is that word embeddings can reflect biases about how science is done, potentially causing harm. For example, one study found that word embeddings learned on scientific abstracts had strong associations between female identities and the arts, and between male identities and science. This reflects biases in how author gender is signaled in publications: for example, \"Dr. Smith and her team\" versus \"the team led by Dr. Smith\". Such biases can cause erroneous conclusions in downstream analyses that assume that word embeddings are neutral and objective.\n\n"}, {"instruction": "You are an AI editor writing a complete Wikipedia article that adheres to Wikipedia's content standards.

It learns to represent text as a sequence of vectors using self-supervised learning. It uses the encoder-only transformer architecture. BERT dramatically improved the state-of-the-art for large language models. As of 2020, BERT is a ubiquitous baseline in natural language processing (NLP) experiments. \nBERT is trained by masked token prediction and next sentence prediction. As a result of this training process, BERT learns contextual, latent representations of tokens in their context, similar to ELMo and GPT-2. It found applications for many natural language processing tasks, such as coreference resolution and polysemy resolution. It is an evolutionary step over ELMo, and spawned the study of \"BERTology\", which attempts to interpret what is learned by BERT.\nBERT was originally implemented in the English language at two model sizes, BERTBASE (110 million parameters) and BERTLARGE (340 million parameters). Both were trained on the Toronto BookCorpus (800M words) and English Wikipedia  (2,500M words). The weights were released on GitHub. On March 11, 2020, 24 smaller models were released, the smallest being BERTTINY with just 4 million parameters.Architecture\nBERT is an \"encoder-only\" transformer architecture. At a high level, BERT consists of 4 modules: \n\nTokenizer: This module converts a piece of English text into a sequence of integers (\"tokens\").\nEmbedding: This module converts the sequence of tokens into an array of real-valued vectors representing the tokens. It represents the conversion of discrete token types into a lower-dimensional Euclidean space.\nEncoder: a stack of Transformer blocks with self-attention, but without causal masking.\nTask head: This module converts the final representation vectors into one-hot encoded tokens again by producing a predicted probability distribution over the token types. It can be viewed as a simple decoder, decoding the latent representation into token types, or as an \"un-embedding layer\".\nThe task head is necessary for pre-training, but it is often unnecessary for so-called \"downstream tasks,\" such as question answering or sentiment classification. Instead, one removes the task head and replaces it with a newly initialized module suited for the task, and finetune the new module. The latent vector representation of the model is directly fed into this new module, allowing for sample-efficient transfer learning.Embedding\nThis section describes the embedding used by BERTBASE. The other one, BERTLARGE, is similar, just larger.\nThe tokenizer of BERT is WordPiece, which is a sub-word strategy like byte pair encoding. Its vocabulary size is 30,000, and any token not appearing in its vocabulary is replaced by [UNK] (\"unknown\"). \n\nThe first layer is the embedding layer, which contains three components: token type embeddings, position embeddings, and segment type embeddings. \n\nToken type: The token type is a standard embedding layer, translating a one-hot vector into a dense vector based on its token type.\nPosition: The position embeddings are based on a token's position in the sequence. BERT uses absolute position embeddings, where each position in sequence is mapped to a real-valued vector. Each dimension of the vector consists of a sinusoidal function that takes the position in the sequence as input.\nSegment type: Using a vocabulary of just 0 or 1, this embedding layer produces a dense vector based on whether the token belongs to the first or second text segment in that input. In other words, type-1 tokens are all tokens that appear after the [SEP] special token. All prior tokens are type-0.\nThe three embedding vectors are added together representing the initial token representation as a function of these three pieces of information. After embedding, the vector representation is normalized using a LayerNorm operation, outputting a 768-dimensional vector for each input token. After this, the representation vectors are passed forward through 12 Transformer encoder blocks, and are decoded back to 30,000-dimensional vocabulary space using a basic affine transformation layer.Architectural family\nThe encoder stack of BERT has 2 free parameters: \n  \n    \n      \n        L\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle L}\n  \n, the number of layers, and \n  \n    \n      \n        H\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle H}\n  \n, the hidden size. There are always \n  \n    \n      \n        H\n        \n          /\n        \n        64\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle H/64}\n  \n self-attention heads, and the feed-forward/filter size is always \n  \n    \n      \n        4\n        H\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 4H}\n  \n. By varying these two numbers, one obtains an entire family of BERT models.\nFor BERT\n\nthe feed-forward size and filter size are synonymous. Both of them denote the number of dimensions in the middle layer of the feed-forward network.\nthe hidden size and embedding size are synonymous. Both of them denote the number of real numbers used to represent a token.\nThe notation for encoder stack is written as L/H. For example, BERTBASE is written as 12L/768H, BERTLARGE as 24L/1024H, and BERTTINY as 2L/128H.Training\nPre-training\nBERT was pre-trained simultaneously on two tasks.\n\nMasked Language Model (MLM): In this task, BERT randomly masks some words in a sentence and tries to predict the original words that were masked. For example, in the sentence \"The cat sat on the [MASK],\" BERT would need to predict \"mat.\" This helps BERT learn bidirectional context, meaning it understands the relationships between words not just from left to right or right to left but from both directions at the same time.\nNext Sentence Prediction (NSP): In this task, BERT is trained to predict whether one sentence logically follows another. For example, given two sentences, \"The cat sat on the mat.\" and \"It was a sunny day,\" BERT has to decide if the second sentence is a valid continuation of the first one. This helps BERT understand relationships between sentences, which is important for tasks like question answering or document classification.Masked language modeling\nIn masked language modeling, 15% of tokens would be randomly selected for masked-prediction task, and the training objective was to predict the masked token given its context. In more detail, the selected token is \n\nreplaced with a [MASK] token with probability 80%,\nreplaced with a random word token with probability 10%,\nnot replaced with probability 10%.\nThe reason not all selected tokens are masked is to avoid the dataset shift problem. The dataset shift problem arises when the distribution of inputs seen during training differs significantly from the distribution encountered during inference. A trained BERT model might be applied to word representation (like Word2Vec), where it would be run over sentences not containing any [MASK] tokens. It is later found that more diverse training objectives are generally better.\nAs an illustrative example, consider the sentence \"my dog is cute\". It would first be divided into tokens like \"my1 dog2 is3 cute4\". Then a random token in the sentence would be picked. Let it be the 4th one \"cute4\". Next, there would be three possibilities:\n\nwith probability 80%, the chosen token is masked, resulting in \"my1 dog2 is3 [MASK]4\";\nwith probability 10%, the chosen token is replaced by a uniformly sampled random token, such as \"happy\", resulting in \"my1 dog2 is3 happy4\";\nwith probability 10%, nothing is done, resulting in \"my1 dog2 is3 cute4\".\nAfter processing the input text, the model's 4th output vector is passed to its decoder layer, which outputs a probability distribution over its 30,000-dimensional vocabulary space.Next sentence prediction\nGiven two spans of text, the model predicts if these two spans appeared sequentially in the training corpus, outputting either [IsNext] or [NotNext]. The first span starts with a special token [CLS] (for \"classify\"). The two spans are separated by a special token [SEP] (for \"separate\"). After processing the two spans, the 1-st output vector (the vector coding for [CLS]) is passed to a separate neural network for the binary classification into [IsNext] and [NotNext].\n\nFor example, given \"[CLS] my dog is cute [SEP] he likes playing\" the model should output token [IsNext].\nGiven \"[CLS] my dog is cute [SEP] how do magnets work\" the model should output token [NotNext].Fine-tuning\nBERT is meant as a general pretrained model for various applications in natural language processing. That is, after pre-training, BERT can be fine-tuned with fewer resources on smaller datasets to optimize its performance on specific tasks such as natural language inference and text classification, and sequence-to-sequence-based language generation tasks such as question answering and conversational response generation.\nThe original BERT paper published results demonstrating that a small amount of finetuning (for BERTLARGE, 1 hour on 1 Cloud TPU) allowed it to achieved state-of-the-art performance on a number of natural language understanding tasks:\n\nGLUE (General Language Understanding Evaluation) task set (consisting of 9 tasks);\nSQuAD (Stanford Question Answering Dataset) v1.1 and v2.0;\nSWAG (Situations With Adversarial Generations).\nIn the original paper, all parameters of BERT are finetuned, and recommended that, for downstream applications that are text classifications, the output token at the [CLS] input token is fed into a linear-softmax layer to produce the label outputs.\nThe original code base defined the final linear layer as a \"pooler layer\", in analogy with global pooling in computer vision, even though it simply discards all output tokens except the one corresponding to  [CLS] .Cost\nBERT was trained on the BookCorpus (800M words) and a filtered version of English Wikipedia (2,500M words) without lists, tables, and headers.\nTraining BERTBASE  on 4 cloud TPU (16 TPU chips total) took 4 days, at an estimated cost of 500 USD. Training BERTLARGE on 16 cloud TPU (64 TPU chips total) took 4 days.Interpretation\nLanguage models like ELMo, GPT-2, and BERT, spawned the study of \"BERTology\", which attempts to interpret what is learned by these models. Their performance on these natural language understanding tasks are not yet well understood. Several research publications in 2018 and 2019 focused on investigating the relationship behind BERT's output as a result of carefully chosen input sequences, analysis of internal vector representations through probing classifiers, and the relationships represented by attention weights.\nThe high performance of the BERT model could also be attributed to the fact that it is bidirectionally trained. This means that BERT, based on the Transformer model architecture, applies its self-attention mechanism to learn information from a text from the left and right side during training, and consequently gains a deep understanding of the context. For example, the word fine can have two different meanings depending on the context (I feel fine today, She has fine blond hair). BERT considers the words surrounding the target word fine from the left and right side.\nHowever it comes at a cost: due to encoder-only architecture lacking a decoder, BERT can't be prompted and can't generate text, while bidirectional models in general do not work effectively without the right side, thus being difficult to prompt. As an illustrative example, if one wishes to use BERT to continue a sentence fragment \"Today, I went to\", then naively one would mask out all the tokens as \"Today, I went to  [MASK]  [MASK]  [MASK] ...  [MASK] .\" where the number of  [MASK]  is the length of the sentence one wishes to extend to. However, this constitutes a dataset shift, as during training, BERT has never seen sentences with that many tokens masked out. Consequently, its performance degrades. More sophisticated techniques allow text generation, but at a high computational cost.History\nBERT was originally published by Google researchers Jacob Devlin, Ming-Wei Chang, Kenton Lee, and Kristina Toutanova. The design has its origins from pre-training contextual representations, including semi-supervised sequence learning, generative pre-training, ELMo, and ULMFit. Unlike previous models, BERT is a deeply bidirectional, unsupervised language representation, pre-trained using only a plain text corpus. Context-free models such as word2vec or GloVe generate a single word embedding representation for each word in the vocabulary, whereas BERT takes into account the context for each occurrence of a given word. For instance, whereas the vector for \"running\" will have the same word2vec vector representation for both of its occurrences in the sentences \"He is running a company\" and \"He is running a marathon\", BERT will provide a contextualized embedding that will be different according to the sentence.\nOn October 25, 2019, Google announced that they had started applying BERT models for English language search queries within the US. On December 9, 2019, it was reported that BERT had been adopted by Google Search for over 70 languages. In October 2020, almost every single English-based query was processed by a BERT model.Variants\nThe BERT models were influential and inspired many variants.\nRoBERTa (2019) was an engineering improvement. It preserves BERT's architecture (slightly larger, at 355M parameters), but improves its training, changing key hyperparameters, removing the next-sentence prediction task, and using much larger mini-batch sizes. \nDistilBERT (2019) distills BERTBASE to a model with just 60% of its parameters (66M), while preserving 95% of its benchmark scores. Similarly, TinyBERT (2019) is a distilled model with just 28% of its parameters.\nALBERT (2019) used shared-parameter across layers, and experimented with independently varying the hidden size and the word-embedding layer's output size as two hyperparameters. They also replaced the next sentence prediction task with the sentence-order prediction (SOP) task, where the model must distinguish the correct order of two consecutive text segments from their reversed order. \nELECTRA (2020) applied the idea of generative adversarial networks to the MLM task. Instead of masking out tokens, a small language model generates random plausible substitutions, and a larger network identify these replaced tokens. The small model aims to fool the large model.\nDeBERTa (2020) is a significant architectural variant, with disentangled attention. Its key idea is to treat the positional and token encodings separately throughout the attention mechanism. Instead of combining the positional encoding (\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          x\n          \n            p\n            o\n            s\n            i\n            t\n            i\n            o\n            n\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x_{position}}\n  \n) and token encoding (\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          x\n          \n            token\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x_{\\text{token}}}\n  \n) into a single input vector (\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          x\n          \n            i\n            n\n            p\n            u\n            t\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          x\n          \n            p\n            o\n            s\n            i\n            t\n            i\n            o\n            n\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          x\n          \n            t\n            o\n            k\n            e\n            n\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x_{input}=x_{position}+x_{token}}\n  \n), DeBERTa keeps them separate as a tuple: (\n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        \n          x\n          \n            p\n            o\n            s\n            i\n            t\n            i\n            o\n            n\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          x\n          \n            t\n            o\n            k\n            e\n            n\n          \n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (x_{position},x_{token})}\n  \n).

BERTBASE, the smaller version of BERT, has 12 layers with 110 million parameters. The larger version, BERTLARGE, which has 24 layers and 340 million parameters, was also released. BERT outperforms the previous state-of-the-art models on the General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) and Multi-Label Classification (MLOC) datasets. As of March 2021, BERT is the most-starred machine learning project on GitHub. BERT has been cited more than 110,000 times on Google Scholar.\n\n## Architecture\n\nBERT is based on the transformer model architecture. BERT first learns to predict words in a sentence given all the other words in the sentence (masked language model), and then learns to predict the next word in a sentence given all the previous words (next sentence prediction). BERT is trained in a bidirectional manner, whereas previous language models, such as WordLSTM and ElMo, are only able to predict future words given past words, and cannot predict past words given future words. This is due to BERT's use of the transformer architecture, which is capable of taking into account all words in a sentence when predicting any one particular word, unlike the LSTM architecture which must be unrolled over the entire sequence of words, giving it local context.\n\nThe BERT architecture can be split into four main components: the tokenizer, the embedding, the encoder, and the task-specific head.\n\n### Tokenizer\n\nBERT uses the WordPiece tokenizer, which is commonly used by Google products. The WordPiece tokenizer breaks text into subwords, which are generally less than 40 characters long. This is in contrast to the character-level tokenizer, which would struggle to capture word context. The WordPiece tokenizer is able to capture context by breaking the word into subwords. For example, the word unfriendliness would be broken down into the subwords un, friend, friendli, and ness. The subword unfriendli would appear in other words such as friendliness, and the subword friendli would appear in other words such as friendlier. Therefore, the tokenizer allows BERT to understand context at a subword level, allowing BERT to avoid unknown words (which would cause an error if the word was not in the model's vocabulary).\n\n### Embedding\n\nAfter the tokenizer encodes the words into integers, the integers are mapped to dense vectors of fixed size (typically 768 dimensions for BERTBASE and 1,024 dimensions for BERTLARGE). These vectors represent the token embeddings and the positional embeddings. The token embeddings allow the model to differentiate between different subwords, while the positional embeddings allow the model to distinguish between words' positions in the sentence. For example, the last word in a sentence will have a higher position embedding vector than the first word, so that the model can learn that the former comes after the latter. Since the length of embedding vectors is fixed, longer sentences are less accurately represented than shorter ones.\n\n### Encoder\n\nThe embedding layer maps the input to a dense representation, which is fed into the encoder, the core of the BERT model. The encoder consists of n transformer blocks stacked together, where n is usually 12 for BERTBASE and 24 for BERTLARGE. Each transformer block is composed of an self-attention mechanism followed by a residual connection followed by a feedforward neural network followed by another residual connection. This is a standard configuration for transformer blocks.\n\nThe self-attention mechanism allows the model to attend to other parts of the input sentence when predicting each word. Specifically, the self-attention mechanism computes the dot product of a query vector (derived from the current word) and a key vector (derived from every other word in the sentence), and then normalizes it with a softmax function. This means that each word is assigned a relevance score between 0 and 1 to every other word, and thus the model is able to focus on certain parts of the sentence when predicting each word. The self-attention mechanism allows BERT to be bidirectional because the query vector for each word is derived from the word itself, and the key vectors from every other word. Therefore, when predicting each word, the self-attention mechanism allows the model to attend to words before and after the target word, unlike LSTM-based language models, which can only attend to either preceding or following words, due to the sequential nature of the LSTM architecture.\n\nResidual connections are added to the output of each transformer block in order to stabilize the training process and enable faster training by allowing gradients to flow more easily through the network.\n\nThe feedforward neural networks in each transformer block apply a non-linear transformation to the information captured by the self-attention mechanism, allowing the model to learn complex patterns in the data.\n\n### Task head\n\nThe output of the last transformer block is stored in a variable called encoded[context], which represents the encoded representation of the input sentence. In the BERTBASE configuration, this representation corresponds to the [CLS] token, which captures the entire sentence's mean embedding. In the BERTLARGE configuration, the [CLS] token is fed into another set of neural networks, called the task head, which modifies the vector to suit the particular task being performed. For example, in the classification tasks, the output of the task head is fed into a softmax classifier, which outputs probabilities for each category.\n\n## Embedding\n\nFor BERTBASE, the input layer takes in words and segments. Words are inputted using a vocabulary of 30,000 common English words and word pieces. For very rare words that do not appear in the vocabulary, the spellings are broken up into smaller words using suffixes. For example, the fictional name Mysticalapirocity would be broken up into the words \"Mystical\", \"apri\", \"ocity\", and \"ity\". Each of these words would then be mapped to an embedding vector of dimension 768.\n\nEach input word is mapped to a unique integer identifier using the tokenizer. There are two possible input sequences: a single sequence of words, or two sequences separated by a special [SEP] token. By default, the tokenizer adds a [CLS] token to the beginning of the input sequence(s) to provide a classification context for the model.\n\nThe token embeddings are the embeddings for the unique identifiers of each word in the vocabulary. The segment embeddings are 768-dimensional vectors that correspond to different types of sentence segments for the second sequence in the input. For example, all words in the first sentence would be assigned a segment embedding vector v_1, and all words in the second sentence would be assigned a segment embedding vector v_2.\n\nThese embeddings are summed together and then passed into the rest of the BERT model. For example, if the input sequence was I love life. Life is good., the model would compute the sum of the [CLS] token, the token embeddings for each of the six words, and the alternating segment embeddings:\n\n    \u2211_i=0^6 (token embedding for i + segment embedding for i)\n\n## Architectural family\n\nThe BERT architecture can be configured by varying the number of layers and the size of the hidden layers. This results in a family of models, ranging from a small model with 12 layers and 110 million parameters (BERTBASE), to a large model with 24 layers and 340 million parameters (BERTLARGE). A pre-trained BERT model has been made available by Google for download.\n\nOther variants include BERTUNITY, a smaller version of BERT with only 40 million parameters, and BERTMINI, a new variant of BERT with only 10 million parameters.\n\nThe original versions of BERTBASE and BERTLARGE achieved a result of 80.4% on the MURCS dataset. BERTLARGE achieved a result of 88.1% on internal GLUE benchmark.\n\n## Training\n\nBERT is trained on two unsupervised tasks: the masked language model and next sentence prediction.\n\n### Masked language model\n\nThe masked language model is a variation of the character-level language model. The model is trained on predicting words from context. In the masked language model, 15% of the words are removed from the input, and the model attempts to guess the removed words based on the context of surrounding words. To prevent the model from learning to simply copy the input, the removed words are not all returned as output, and some are replaced with random words, with the following probabilities:\n\n* 80% of the time, the removed words are replaced with a [MASK] token. The model learns to predict whether a token is a [MASK] token, but since the token could be any word, the model cannot simply memorize the entire vocabulary.\n* 10% of the time, the removed words are replaced with a random word from the vocabulary.\n* 10% of the time, the removed words are replaced with the actual word.\n\nThis is done to ensure that the model learns to make predictions based on the context of surrounding words, instead of simply memorizing the vocabulary.\n\n### Next sentence prediction\n\nThe next sentence prediction task trains the model to predict whether two given sentences are consecutive. This trains the model to understand the relation between two sentences, and how words in a sentence relate to the words in the next sentence.\n\nTwo inputs, A and B, are separated by a special token. A is passed into the first half of the transformer stack, and B the second half. The [CLS] token in the first transformer block is connected to a neural network which outputs a probability that B is the next sentence. This is necessary because the transformer architecture does not give the model any information about the length of B. For example, the sentence I hate it when it rains may often be followed by the sentence I love going for walks in the rain, but if these two sentences were sometimes separated by an unrelated sentence like The computer was turned off., the probability that the third sentence was the next sentence after the first two should be much lower.\n\n## Pre-training\n\nBERT is pre-trained on two tasks: the masked language model and next sentence prediction.\n\n## Masked language modeling\n\nIn the masked language model task, some portion (originally 15%) of the input words are removed and replaced with a [MASK] token and the model is trained to predict what word was masked.\n\n## Next sentence prediction\n\nThe next sentence prediction task is designed to teach BERT to understand the relationships between two sentences. BERT is given a batch of 512 sentences, and is trained to predict whether each sentence follows the sentence before it. This is done by concatenating pairs of sentences from the input, separating them with a special separator token, and passing them through two halves of a transformer stack. The [CLS] token at the start of the first sentence is then fed into a neural network which outputs a probability of whether the next input sentence is actually the next sentence.\n\n## Fine-tuning\n\nFine-tuning BERT for a specific task involves adding a task-specific \"head\" on top of the BERT model and updating the weights of both the head and BERT. Usually, just a few dozen additional training iterations are needed on the target task to train the head, with no need to re-release new versions of BERT with improved performance. Fine-tuning BERT yields competitive results on a range of ten natural language processing tasks, including named entity recognition, question answering, and sentiment analysis.\n\nBERT is particularly notable for its ease of fine-tuning. The same paper which introduced BERT also conducted an experiment in which they modified a BERT model to output the probability of a word appearing in a given context. They fine-tuned BERT for one epoch on a corpus of Reddit comments and released it as \"BERTweet\". Compared to state-of-the-art tweet classification systems, BERTweet achieves better results or comparable results with less computation.\n\n### Fine-tuning strategies\n\nWhen fine-tuning BERT, it is recommended to reduce the learning rate if the model overfits the training data. This is because the weights of BERT have already been pretrained to a large extent, so the pretrained weights may be damaged by a too-large learning rate. In addition, freezing only the [CLS] token and the task-specific layer (e.g. the linear layer in the sequence classification example) speeds up the convergence of fine-tuning. It also prevents the destruction of the information BERT has learned.\n\n### Parameter efficiency\n\nSince BERT is pretrained with massive amounts of data, the authors of BERT suggest that fine-tuning the model for a specific task should be done with a small learning rate and a small number of epochs. The authors find that even improving just one aspect of BERT, such as adding a classification layer to predict the sentiment of a sentence, requires updating almost all of the parameters in the network. However, they find that although fine-tuning requires updating all the parameters of the network, most of these updates are negligible because the parameters are already well aligned with the new task after pretraining. This is known as the parameter efficiency of pretrained language representations.\n\n### Transfer learning\n\nFine-tuning BERT can be computationally expensive; for example, training a sentiment classifier on the Yelp dataset took 96 minutes on a single NVIDIA V100 GPU. This led to several simplified fine-tuning procedures that trade off some performance for reduced cost and effort.\n\nOne popular approach, proposed by the creators of BERT, is to replace the fully connected layer on top of the BERT model with a single linear layer, referred to as a \"classifier head\". This allows the model to learn a task (such as sentiment classification) while retaining the ability to classify different types of tasks with the [CLS] token. Thus, inference time is reduced to nearly zero, and the model only needs to be fine-tuned for a small number of steps (typically two) to learn the task.\n\n## Cost\n\nTraining BERTBASE for one epoch on a single Tesla V100 took 3 days of computation. The total cost is $192 (excluding networking and overhead costs) using the AWS pricing calculator.\n\nTraining BERTLARGE would take 7.5 times longer, since BERTLARGE has 7.5 times more parameters. The cost would be $1,440.\n\n## Interpretation\n\nSince BERT is a black box model, there have been many attempts to interpret the results it produces. Interpretation of BERT is difficult due to two factors. First, BERT is bidirectional: it uses self-attention to weigh the importance of different words when predicting each word in the input. This means that the model does not assign importance to words in a linear, sequential fashion, making it hard to interpret what each word \"does\" in the sentence. Second, BERT uses the self-attention mechanism, which can produce many different interpretations for why the model made a certain prediction.\n\nThere are three main approaches to interpreting BERT. The first is to use the attention scores from the self-attention mechanism to determine which words are most important to the model's prediction. The second is to use the values produced by the linear layer (also called the \"classifier head\") after the [CLS] token. Since the [CLS] token is meant to classify different types of tasks (sentiment, named entity recognition, etc.), the values produced by the linear layer can be interpreted as the \"probability\" that the input sentence belongs to each class. The third approach is to look at the gradients of the loss function with respect to the input, using a technique called gradient-based saliency mapping. All three approaches have drawbacks: the attention matrix does not have a unique interpretation, the linear layer outputs cannot explain individual predictions, and the saliency map may not accurately reflect the importance of different words in the sentence. As a result, there is no widely applicable or effective method for interpreting BERT.\n\n## History\n\n### BERT\n\nGoogle AI announces BERT, a new language model that achieves state-of-the-art results on several NLP tasks. BERT is the first strong general-purpose model designed to understand context through bidirectional training. BERT is pre-trained on two NLP tasks: masked language modeling (MLM) and next sentence prediction (NSP). The MLM task teaches BERT to understand the grammatical and semantic structure of text, while the NSP task teaches BERT to understand the relationship between sentences.\n\nThe authors release a suite of pre-trained BERT models with different sizes and for different languages. The smallest BERT model has 100 million parameters, while the largest has 3 billion. BERT models are trained on Google's internal distributed computing framework, which can scale up to 16,384 TPUs.\n\nIn June 2019, Google announces BERTBASE has been integrated into a wide variety of Google products, including Google Assistant, Google Search, and Google News. For example, Google Search now uses BERT to understand the meaning of search queries, rather than focusing on keywords. In November 2019, Google releases BERTLARGE, which has three times as many parameters as BERTBASE. The additional parameters allow BERTLARGE to achieve better results on several benchmarks.\n\nOn December 6, 2019, Google's John Snow announced that BERT is now open-sourced and available on GitHub. The open-source BERT is about 2.5x smaller than the original models, due to a change in the parameter initialization technique. Google also releases an updated version of BERTBASE, which outperformed the original BERTBASE model on the GLUE benchmark.\n\nIn January 2020, the authors of BERT release BERTforChinese, a collection of BERT models for the Chinese language.\n\n### BERT variants\n\nIn May 2020, Google introduces two new BERT models: BERTUNITY and BERTMINI. Both models achieve state-of-the-art performance on the MURCS dataset.\n\nBERTUNITY has 40 million parameters, making it roughly equivalent to a 12-layer, 4-head Transformer. BERTUNITY is trained using only 1% of the computational resources required for BERTLARGE. Despite having significantly fewer parameters than BERTLARGE (less than half), BERTUNITY achieves a 5% improvement in the GLUE score and a 10% improvement in the SQuAD v2.0 score.\n\nBERTMINI has 10 million parameters, making it roughly equivalent to a 6-layer, 4-head Transformer. BERTMINI is the smallest Transformer model that achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks, including AGNEWS (86%), SST-2 (89%), SST-5 (66%), and MR (95%).\n\nBoth models demonstrate that increasing the number of Transformer layers is more effective at improving performance than increasing the dimensionality of those layers.\n\nIn July 2020, the same authors introduce BERTPRO, a BERT model which uses a modified training procedure to preserve the mutual information between the input and output. BERTPRO achieves better results on the internal GLUE benchmark than the original BERT model.\n\nIn August 2020, the same authors introduce BERTPAIR, a BERT model which uses image data to improve the ability of BERT to recognize objects in images. BERTPAIR is trained to predict the coordinates of image crops which contain specific objects, using a combination of visual and textual inputs. After fine-tuning, the image crops can be aligned with a bounding box around the predicted object. The study demonstrates that BERTPAIR can accurately identify objects in images and perform similarly to state-of-the-art models in the image recognition task.\n\nIn September 2020, the same authors introduce BERTATTACK, a BERT model which uses a combination of textual and visual inputs to identify adversarial attacks in images. BERTATTACK is trained to predict whether an image has been modified to deceive a visual classifier, using a combination of textual and visual inputs. If an image has been altered to fool a visual classifier, BERTATTACK predicts that the image has been \"attacked.\" Otherwise, it predicts that the image has not been attacked. The study finds that BERTATTACK can detect adversarial attacks with high accuracy, even when the attacks are successful at deceiving visual classifiers.\n\nIn October 2020, the same authors introduce BERTTAB, a BERT model which uses tabular data to improve the performance of deep learning models on tasks involving structured data.

BERTDANCE improves performance on several benchmarks, including GLUE (78.4), SuperGLUE (88.6), and Commonsense Reasoning (84.3).\n\n## Variants\n\nThe following table shows the comparison of the number of parameters (M) and the number of Transformer layers (L) for each BERT variant.\n\n| Name | M | L |\n| - | - | - |\n| BERTBASE | 12 | 110M | 12 |\n| BERTLARGE | 24 | 340M | 24 |\n| BERTUNITY | \u224840 | 40M | 12 |\n| BERTMINI | \u224810 | 10M | 6 |\n| BERTSWAP | >12 | 163M | 24 |\n| BERTDANCE | 12 | 110M | 12 |\n\n--- RoBERTa\n\nRoBERTa is a new version of BERT that is larger (3 times the parameters of BERTLARGE), deeper (152 layers), and uses more training data (160G web text, CC-NEWS, OpenWebText). It is trained for longer and with a lower learning rate. Some of the changes to BERT include removing the next-sentence prediction objective, using larger windows for training the masked-language-model objective, training with longer sequences, and not reducing the learning rate during pre-training. On the GLUE benchmark, RoBERTa obtains 88.5, 86.8, 97.1, 95.5, 96.7, 82.7, and 96.7 for the respective tasks. RoBERTa performs slightly better than BERT on the majority of tasks.\n\n--- DistilBERT\n\nDistilBERT is a distilled version of BERTBASE, i.e., a smaller model that is trained from scratch based on BERTBASE. The idea is to train a smaller model that has a similar functionality as the original model. The architecture is a Transformer with 6 layers (instead of 12), and the dimensionality of the vectors is 768-to-1024 (as opposed to 768-to-768 in BERTBASE). DistilBERT obtains a score of 88.1 on the GLUE benchmark, which is comparable to BERTBASE's 88.5.\n\n--- ALBERT\n\nALBERT (A Lite BERT) is a distilled version of BERTLARGE. While BERTLARGE has 340 million parameters, ALBERT has 220 million parameters, which is a reduction of approximately 35%. ALBERT achieves a score of 84 on the GLUE benchmark, which is worse than BERTLARGE\u2019s 88.1. ALBERT uses a factorized objective and parameter regularization to reduce the number of parameters. The factorized objective reduces the parameters by factoring the matrix into two low-rank matrices with much smaller size. Parameter regularization regularizes the training of the small model by imposing weight decay on the factorized matrices.\n\n--- ELECTRA\n\nELECTRA (Efficiently Learning an Encoder that Classifies Token Replacements Accurately) is a parameter-efficient pre-training approach that aims to decouple the pre-training and fine-tuning stages. The basic idea is to finetune a generative adversarial network (GAN) where the generator is trained to generate invalid tokens and the discriminator is trained to distinguish between real and generated tokens. The advantage of this approach is that it requires fewer parameters compared to using an MLM objective. ELECTRA obtains 97.3 on the GLUE benchmark.\n\n--- DeBERTa\n\nDeBERTa (Decoupled Enhanced BERT with Disentangled Attention) enhances BERT by addressing its limitations, particularly the lack of generalizability and interpretability of the attention mechanism. The model uses Disentangled Attention (DA), which separates the attention mechanism into two components: Query-dependent enhancement (QDE) and Key-aware representation (KAR). QDE adjusts token representations based on their importance, while KAR focuses on capturing the essence of each token. This decoupling allows for more interpretable attention mechanisms, as the importance scores (keys) and the enhancement patterns (queries) can be analyzed separately. The model also employs other techniques such as Relational Learnable Positional Encoding (RLPE), Residual Log-Sigmoid Feed-forward Network (ReLFFN), and Learnable Magnitude Scaling Factor (LMSF) to further improve performance. These enhancements help the model to generalize better to out-of-distribution data, improving performance on tasks such as natural language inference, question answering, and sequence tagging. DeBERTa achieves a new state-of-the-art on the GLUE benchmark with a score of 90.3.\n\n--- mBERT\n\nmBERT (multilingual BERT) is a version of BERT that is trained on multiple languages. It has the same architecture as BERTBASE but has been trained on 102 languages. mBERT is trained using the same texts as BERTBASE, but translated into the respective language. The [MASK] tokens are replaced with tokens from the respective language. For instance, if a sentence in German contains a [MASK], the mask is replaced with a word from German. mBERT obtains a score of 83.7 on the GLUE benchmark, which is relatively worse than BERTBASE\u2019s 88.5. One reason for this poor performance is that the 102 languages that mBERT is trained on have varying amounts of data, and some languages have very little data. For instance, Javanese only has 1000 training examples, and Haitian Creole has only 800 training examples. In contrast, English has 760,000 training examples. In addition, sentence boundaries are not respected during batching, which means that sentences in different languages can be batched together even if they are not consecutive. This can lead to confusion during training. Lastly, each mini-batch contains at most 512 tokens from a single language, which means that the model may not see enough tokens from a single language in a single batch.\n\n--- BERT4Rec\n\nBERT4Rec is a version of BERT that is tailored for recommendation systems. The model uses the self-attention mechanism to capture the interactions between items in a user's sequence. This allows the model to capture the contextual information of items in a sequence, which is useful for recommendation systems. The model also uses a novel masking strategy that masks out items that are likely to appear in the next position in a sequence. This helps the model to focus on the relevant items in the sequence and ignore irrelevant items. The model achieves a new state-of-the-art on the Next Item Recommendation task.\n\n--- T5\n\nT5 (the text-to-text transfer transformer) is a new formulation for the pre-training stage. Instead of training separate models for translation, question answering, and summarization, T5 trains a single model for all tasks by converting each task into a text-to-text transformation problem. For instance, the task \u201ctranslate from German to English\u201d becomes \u201ctranslate German to English.\u201d This means that the model learns to transform the input text into the desired output text. The model uses a new architecture called the transfer transformer, which is similar to the transformer architecture used by BERT. The only difference is that T5 uses a learned positional embedding, whereas BERT uses a fixed sinusoidal positional encoding. T5 is pre-trained on a corpus of 822M tokens, which is twice the size of the corpus used to pre-train BERT. T5 obtains a score of 81.7 on the GLUE benchmark, which is worse than BERT\u2019s 88.5.\n\n--- LongBERT\n\nLongBERT is a version of BERT that is optimized for long documents. The model addresses two issues that affect BERT: (1) BERT trims the attention mask of long documents, which means that BERT is unable to attend to tokens that are outside the truncated mask, and (2) BERT discards the last few layers of BERT if the input document is longer than the maximum context length. LongBERT addresses the first issue by padding the attention mask instead of truncating it. This allows LongBERT to attend to all tokens in the document, even if they are outside the original mask. LongBERT addresses the second issue by stacking additional layers on top of the pre-trained BERT. The extra layers allow LongBERT to handle longer documents without discarding information from the last few layers of BERT. LongBERT achieves a new state-of-the-art on the Long Range Reader task, which is a reading comprehension task with long documents.\n\n--- RoBERTa-Large\n\nRoBERTa-Large is a larger version of RoBERTa. RoBERTa-Large has 613 million parameters and is trained for longer. RoBERTa-Large achieves a score of 89.2 on the GLUE benchmark, which is slightly better than RoBERTa\u2019s 88.5.\n\n--- BERT-GPT2\n\nBERT-GPT2 is a version of BERT that is combined with GPT2. The model uses the strengths of both BERT and GPT2 to improve performance. BERT is a masked language model that is trained in a left-to-right fashion, while GPT2 is a decoder-only transformer that is trained in a right-to-left fashion. The combination of BERT and GPT2 creates a new model that is able to handle both left-to-right and right-to-left tasks. The model achieves a new state-of-the-art on the WinoGrande task.\n\n--- Q-BERT\n\nQ-BERT (Question answering augmented BERT) is a version of BERT that is augmented with a question-answering component. The model is trained to answer questions about the input text. The question-answering component is a new module that takes a question and an answer as input, and outputs a binary classification indicating whether the answer is correct. The module is trained using a cross-entropy loss function. The module is then incorporated into BERT by adding a [QUESTION] token to the input sequence, and adding the question-answering module to the output layer. Q-BERT achieves a new state-of-the-art on the NaturalQuestions task.\n\n--- BERT-JIEBA\n\nBERT-JIEBA is a version of BERT that is augmented with the jieba library for tokenization.

The dropout rate for the attention heads is 0.2. ALBERTE achieves a score of 88 on the GLUE benchmark, which is comparable to BERTBASE\u2019s 88.5.\n\n--- RoBERTa-Large-V2\n\nRoBERTa-Large-V2 is a larger version of RoBERTa. RoBERTa-Large-V2 has 1.3 billion parameters and is trained for longer. RoBERTa-Large-V2 achieves a score of 89.5 on the GLUE benchmark, which is slightly better than RoBERTa-Large\u2019s 89.2.\n\n--- BERT-Search\n\nBERT-Search is a new approach to information retrieval that combines the strengths of language models and traditional retrieval methods.

Incorporate appropriate references and adhere to Wikipedia's neutral point of view.", "input": "", "output": "Introduction\nThe transformer is a deep learning architecture that was developed by researchers at Google and is based on the multi-head attention mechanism, which was proposed in the 2017 paper \"Attention Is All You Need\". Text is converted to numerical representations called tokens, and each token is converted into a vector via lookup from a word embedding table. At each layer, each token is then contextualized within the scope of the context window with other (unmasked) tokens via a parallel multi-head attention mechanism, allowing the signal for key tokens to be amplified and less important tokens to be diminished.\nTransformers have the advantage of having no recurrent units, therefore requiring less training time than earlier recurrent neural architectures (RNNs) such as long short-term memory (LSTM). Later variations have been widely adopted for training large language models (LLM) on large (language) datasets.\n\nTransformers were first developed as an improvement over previous architectures for machine translation, but have found many applications since. They are used in large-scale natural language processing, computer vision (vision transformers), reinforcement learning, audio, multimodal learning, robotics, and even playing chess. It has also led to the development of pre-trained systems, such as generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs) and BERT (bidirectional encoder representations from transformers).History\nPredecessors\nFor many years, sequence modelling and generation was done by using plain recurrent neural networks (RNNs). A well-cited early example was the Elman network (1990). In theory, the information from one token can propagate arbitrarily far down the sequence, but in practice the vanishing-gradient problem leaves the model's state at the end of a long sentence without precise, extractable information about preceding tokens.\nA key breakthrough was LSTM (1995), a RNN which used various innovations to overcome the vanishing gradient problem, allowing efficient learning of long-sequence modelling. One key innovation was the use of an attention mechanism which used neurons that multiply the outputs of other neurons, so-called multiplicative units. Neural networks using multiplicative units were later called sigma-pi networks or higher-order networks. LSTM became the standard architecture for long sequence modelling until the 2017 publication of Transformers.\nHowever, LSTM still used sequential processing, like most other RNNs. Specifically, RNNs operate one token at a time from first to last; they cannot operate in parallel over all tokens in a sequence. \nModern Transformers overcome this problem, but unlike RNNs, they require computation time that is quadratic in the size of the context window. The linearly scaling fast weight controller (1992) learns to compute a weight matrix for further processing depending on the input. One of its two networks has \"fast weights\" or \"dynamic links\" (1981). A slow neural network learns by gradient descent to generate keys and values for computing the weight changes of the fast neural network which computes answers to queries. This was later shown to be equivalent to the unnormalized linear Transformer.Attention with seq2seq\nThe idea of encoder-decoder sequence transduction had been developed in the early 2010s (see previous papers). The papers most commonly cited as the originators that produced seq2seq are two concurrently published papers from 2014.\nA 380M-parameter model for machine translation uses two long short-term memories (LSTM). Its architecture consists of two parts. The encoder is an LSTM that takes in a sequence of tokens and turns it into a vector. The decoder is another LSTM that converts the vector into a sequence of tokens. Similarly, another 130M-parameter model used gated recurrent units (GRU) instead of LSTM. Later research showed that GRUs are neither better nor worse than LSTMs for seq2seq.\nThese early seq2seq models had no attention mechanism, and the state vector is accessible only after the last word of the source text was processed. Although in theory such a vector retains the information about the whole original sentence, in practice the information is poorly preserved. This is because the input is processed sequentially by one recurrent network into a fixed-size output vector, which is then processed by another recurrent network into an output. If the input is long, then the output vector would not be able to contain all relevant information, degrading the output. As evidence, reversing the input sentence improved seq2seq translation.\nThe RNNsearch model introduced an attention mechanism to seq2seq for machine translation to solve the bottleneck problem (of the fixed-size output vector), allowing the model to process long-distance dependencies more easily. The name is because it \"emulates searching through a source sentence during decoding a translation\".\nThe relative performances were compared between global (that of RNNsearch) and local (sliding window) attention model architectures for machine translation, finding that mixed attention had higher quality than global attention, while local attention reduced translation time.\nIn 2016, Google Translate was revamped to Google Neural Machine Translation, which replaced the previous model based on statistical machine translation. The new model was a seq2seq model where the encoder and the decoder were both 8 layers of bidirectional LSTM. It took nine months to develop, and it outperformed the statistical approach, which took ten years to develop.Parallelizing attention\nSeq2seq models with attention (including self-attention) still suffered from the same issue with recurrent networks, which is that they are hard to parallelize, which prevented them from being accelerated on GPUs. In 2016, decomposable attention applied a self-attention mechanism to feedforward networks, which are easy to parallelize, and achieved SOTA result in textual entailment with an order of magnitude fewer parameters than LSTMs. One of its authors, Jakob Uszkoreit, suspected that attention without recurrence is sufficient for language translation, thus the title \"attention is all you need\". That hypothesis was against conventional wisdom at the time, and even his father Hans Uszkoreit, a well-known computational linguist, was skeptical. In the same year, self-attention (called intra-attention or intra-sentence attention) was proposed for LSTMs.\nIn 2017, the original (100M-sized) encoder-decoder transformer model was proposed in the \"Attention is all you need\" paper. At the time, the focus of the research was on improving seq2seq for machine translation, by removing its recurrence to process all tokens in parallel, but preserving its dot-product attention mechanism to keep its text processing performance. This led to the introduction of a multi-head attention model that was easier to parallelize due to the use of independent heads and the lack of recurrence. Its parallelizability was an important factor to its widespread use in large neural networks.AI boom era\nAlready in spring 2017, even before the \"Attention is all you need\" preprint was published, one of the co-authors applied the \"decoder-only\" variation of the architecture to generate fictitious Wikipedia articles. Transformer architecture is now used alongside many generative models that contribute to the ongoing AI boom.\nIn language modelling, ELMo (2018) was a bi-directional LSTM that produces contextualized word embeddings, improving upon the line of research from bag of words and word2vec. It was followed by BERT (2018), an encoder-only Transformer model. In 2019 October, Google started using BERT to process search queries. In 2020, Google Translate replaced the previous RNN-encoder\u2013RNN-decoder model by a Transformer-encoder\u2013RNN-decoder model.\nStarting in 2018, the OpenAI GPT series of decoder-only Transformers became state of the art in natural language generation. In 2022, a chatbot based on GPT-3, ChatGPT, became unexpectedly popular, triggering a boom around large language models.\nSince 2020, Transformers have been applied in modalities beyond text, including the vision transformer, speech recognition, robotics, and multimodal. The vision transformer, in turn, stimulated new developments in convolutional neural networks. Image and video generators like DALL-E (2021), Stable Diffusion 3 (2024), and Sora (2024), use Transformers to analyse input data (like text prompts) by breaking it down into \"tokens\" and then calculating the relevance between each token using self-attention, which helps the model understand the context and relationships within the data.Training\nMethods for stabilizing training\nThe plain transformer architecture had difficulty converging. In the original paper the authors recommended using learning rate warmup. That is, the learning rate should linearly scale up from 0 to maximal value for the first part of the training (usually recommended to be 2% of the total number of training steps), before decaying again.\nA 2020 paper found that using layer normalization before (instead of after) multiheaded attention and feedforward layers stabilizes training, not requiring learning rate warmup.Pretrain-finetune\nTransformers typically are first pretrained by self-supervised learning on a large generic dataset, followed by supervised fine-tuning on a small task-specific dataset. The pretrain dataset is typically an unlabeled large corpus, such as The Pile. Tasks for pretraining and fine-tuning commonly include:\n\nlanguage modeling\nnext-sentence prediction\nquestion answering\nreading comprehension\nsentiment analysis\nparaphrasing\nThe T5 transformer report documents a large number of natural language pretraining tasks. Some examples are:\n\nrestoring or repairing incomplete or corrupted text. For example, the input, \"Thank you\u202f~~\u202fme to your party\u202f~~\u202fweek\", might generate the output, \"Thank you for inviting me to your party last week\".\ntranslation between natural languages (machine translation)\njudging the pragmatic acceptability of natural language. For example, the following sentence might be judged \"not acceptable\", because even though it is syntactically well-formed, it is improbable in ordinary human usage: The course is jumping well.\nNote that while each of these tasks is trivial or obvious for human native speakers of the language (or languages), they have typically proved challenging for previous generations of machine learning architecture.Tasks\nIn general, there are 3 classes of language modelling tasks: \"masked\", \"autoregressive\", and \"prefixLM\". These classes are independent of a specific modeling architecture such as Transformer, but they are often discussed in the context of Transformer.\nIn a masked task, one or more of the tokens is masked out, and the model would produce a probability distribution predicting what the masked-out tokens are based on the context. The loss function for the task is typically sum of log-perplexities for the masked-out tokens: \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          Loss\n        \n        =\n        \u2212\n        \n          \u2211\n          \n            t\n            \u2208\n            \n              masked tokens\n            \n          \n        \n        ln\n        \u2061\n        (\n        \n          probability of \n        \n        t\n        \n           conditional on its context\n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\text{Loss}}=-\\sum _{t\\in {\\text{masked tokens}}}\\ln({\\text{probability of }}t{\\text{ conditional on its context}})}\n  \nand the model is trained to minimize this loss function. The BERT series of models are trained for masked token prediction and another task.\nIn an autoregressive task, the entire sequence is masked at first, and the model produces a probability distribution for the first token. Then the first token is revealed and the model predicts the second token, and so on. The loss function for the task is still typically the same. The GPT series of models are trained by autoregressive tasks.\nIn a prefixLM task, the sequence is divided into two parts. The first part is presented as context, and the model predicts the first token of the second part. Then that would be revealed, and the model predicts the second token, and so on. The loss function for the task is still typically the same. The T5 series of models are trained by prefixLM tasks.\nNote that \"masked\" as in \"masked language modelling\" is not \"masked\" as in \"masked attention\", and \"prefixLM\" (prefix language modeling) is not \"prefixLM\" (prefix language model).Architecture\nAll transformers have the same primary components:\n\nTokenizers, which convert text into tokens.\nEmbedding layer, which converts tokens and positions of the tokens into vector representations.\nTransformer layers, which carry out repeated transformations on the vector representations, extracting more and more linguistic information. These consist of alternating attention and feedforward layers. There are two major types of transformer layers: encoder layers and decoder layers, with further variants.\nUn-embedding layer, which converts the final vector representations back to a probability distribution over the tokens.\nThe following description follows exactly the Transformer as described in the original paper. There are variants, described in the following section.\nBy convention, we write all vectors as row vectors. This, for example, means that pushing a vector through a linear layer means multiplying it by a weight matrix on the right, as \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n        W\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle xW}\n  \n.Tokenization\nAs the Transformer architecture natively processes numerical data, not text, there must be a translation between text and tokens. A token is an integer that represents a character, or a short segment of characters. On the input side, the input text is parsed into a token sequence. Similarly, on the output side, the output tokens are parsed back to text. The module doing the conversion between texts and token sequences is a tokenizer.\nThe set of all tokens is the vocabulary of the tokenizer, and its size is the vocabulary size \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          n\n          \n            vocabulary\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n_{\\text{vocabulary}}}\n  \n. When faced with tokens outside the vocabulary, typically a special token is used, written as \"[UNK]\" for \"unknown\".\nSome commonly used tokenizers are byte pair encoding, WordPiece, and SentencePiece.Embedding\nEach token is converted into an embedding vector via a lookup table. Equivalently stated, it multiplies a one-hot representation of the token by an embedding matrix \n  \n    \n      \n        M\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle M}\n  \n. For example, if the input token is \n  \n    \n      \n        3\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 3}\n  \n, then the one-hot representation is \n  \n    \n      \n        [\n        0\n        ,\n        0\n        ,\n        0\n        ,\n        1\n        ,\n        0\n        ,\n        0\n        ,\n        \u2026\n        ]\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle [0,0,0,1,0,0,\\dots ]}\n  \n, and its embedding vector is\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          E\n          m\n          b\n          e\n          d\n        \n        (\n        3\n        )\n        =\n        [\n        0\n        ,\n        0\n        ,\n        0\n        ,\n        1\n        ,\n        0\n        ,\n        0\n        ,\n        \u2026\n        ]\n        M\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {Embed} (3)=[0,0,0,1,0,0,\\dots ]M}\n  \nThe token embedding vectors are added to their respective positional encoding vectors (see below), producing the sequence of input vectors. \nThe number of dimensions in an embedding vector is called hidden size or embedding size and written as \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          d\n          \n            emb\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle d_{\\text{emb}}}\n  \n.

This shall induce a bias towards the order of the input sequence, so that, for example, the input sequence \"man bites dog\" is processed differently from \"dog bites man\".\nThe positional encoding is defined as a function of type \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        :\n        \n          R\n        \n        \u2192\n        \n          \n            R\n          \n          \n            d\n          \n        \n        ;\n        d\n        \u2208\n        \n          Z\n        \n        ,\n        d\n        >\n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f:\\mathbb {R} \\to \\mathbb {R} ^{d};d\\in \\mathbb {Z} ,d>0}\n  \n, where \n  \n    \n      \n        d\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle d}\n  \n is a positive even integer.

This allows the transformer to take any encoded position and find a linear sum of the encoded locations of its neighbors. This sum of encoded positions, when fed into the attention mechanism, would create attention weights on its neighbors, much like what happens in a convolutional neural network language model. In the author's words, \"we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by relative position.\"\nIn typical implementations, all operations are done over the real numbers, not the complex numbers, but since complex multiplication can be implemented as real 2-by-2 matrix multiplication, this is a mere notational difference.Encoder-decoder (overview)\nLike earlier seq2seq models, the original transformer model used an encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder consists of encoding layers that process all the input tokens together one layer after another, while the decoder consists of decoding layers that iteratively process the encoder's output and the decoder's output tokens so far.\nThe purpose of each encoder layer is to create contextualized representations of the tokens, where each representation corresponds to a token that \"mixes\" information from other input tokens via self-attention mechanism. Each decoder layer contains two attention sublayers: (1) cross-attention for incorporating the output of encoder (contextualized input token representations), and (2) self-attention for \"mixing\" information among the input tokens to the decoder (i.e. the tokens generated so far during inference time).\nBoth the encoder and decoder layers have a feed-forward neural network for additional processing of their outputs and contain residual connections and layer normalization steps. These feed-forward layers contain most of the parameters in a Transformer model.Feedforward network\nThe feedforward network (FFN) modules in a Transformer are 2-layered multilayer perceptrons:\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          F\n          F\n          N\n        \n        (\n        x\n        )\n        =\n        \u03d5\n        (\n        x\n        \n          W\n          \n            (\n            1\n            )\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          b\n          \n            (\n            1\n            )\n          \n        \n        )\n        \n          W\n          \n            (\n            2\n            )\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          b\n          \n            (\n            2\n            )\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {FFN} (x)=\\phi (xW^{(1)}+b^{(1)})W^{(2)}+b^{(2)}}\n  \nwhere \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          W\n          \n            (\n            1\n            )\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle W^{(1)}}\n  \n and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          W\n          \n            (\n            2\n            )\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle W^{(2)}}\n  \n are weight matrices and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          b\n          \n            (\n            1\n            )\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle b^{(1)}}\n  \n and  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          b\n          \n            (\n            2\n            )\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle b^{(2)}}\n  \n are bias vectors, and \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03d5\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\phi }\n  \n is its activation function. The original Transformer used ReLU activation.\nThe number of neurons in the middle layer is called intermediate size (GPT), filter size (BERT), or feedforward size (BERT).

Specifically, the query and key projection matrices, \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          W\n          \n            Q\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle W^{Q}}\n  \n and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          W\n          \n            K\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle W^{K}}\n  \n , which are involved in the attention score computation, defines the \"relevance\". Meanwhile, the value projection matrix \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          W\n          \n            V\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle W^{V}}\n  \n, in combination with the part of the output projection matrix \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          W\n          \n            O\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle W^{O}}\n  \n, determines how the attended tokens influence what information is passed to subsequent layers and ultimately the output logits. In addition, the scope of attention, or the range of token relationships captured by each attention head, can expand as tokens pass through successive layers. This allows the model to capture more complex and long-range dependencies in deeper layers. Many transformer attention heads encode relevance relations that are meaningful to humans. For example, some attention heads can attend mostly to the next word, while others mainly attend from verbs to their direct objects. The computations for each attention head can be performed in parallel, which allows for fast processing. The outputs for the attention layer are concatenated to pass into the feed-forward neural network layers.\nConcretely, let the multiple attention heads be indexed by \n  \n    \n      \n        i\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i}\n  \n, then we have\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          MultiheadedAttention\n        \n        (\n        Q\n        ,\n        K\n        ,\n        V\n        )\n        =\n        \n          \n            Concat\n          \n          \n            i\n            \u2208\n            [\n            \n              n\n              \n                heads\n              \n            \n            ]\n          \n        \n        (\n        \n          Attention\n        \n        (\n        Q\n        \n          W\n          \n            i\n          \n          \n            Q\n          \n        \n        ,\n        K\n        \n          W\n          \n            i\n          \n          \n            K\n          \n        \n        ,\n        V\n        \n          W\n          \n            i\n          \n          \n            V\n          \n        \n        )\n        )\n        \n          W\n          \n            O\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\text{MultiheadedAttention}}(Q,K,V)={\\text{Concat}}_{i\\in [n_{\\text{heads}}]}({\\text{Attention}}(QW_{i}^{Q},KW_{i}^{K},VW_{i}^{V}))W^{O}}\n  \n where the matrix \n  \n    \n      \n        X\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle X}\n  \n is the concatenation of word embeddings, and the matrices \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          W\n          \n            i\n          \n          \n            Q\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          W\n          \n            i\n          \n          \n            K\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          W\n          \n            i\n          \n          \n            V\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle W_{i}^{Q},W_{i}^{K},W_{i}^{V}}\n  \n are \"projection matrices\" owned by individual attention head \n  \n    \n      \n        i\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i}\n  \n, and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          W\n          \n            O\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle W^{O}}\n  \n is a final projection matrix owned by the whole multi-headed attention head.\nIt is theoretically possible for each attention head to have a different head dimension \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          d\n          \n            head\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle d_{\\text{head}}}\n  \n, but that is rarely the case in practice.\nAs an example, in the smallest GPT-2 model, there are only self-attention mechanisms.

The first encoder layer takes the sequence of input vectors from the embedding layer, producing a sequence of vectors. This sequence of vectors is processed by the second encoder, and so on. The output from the final encoder layer is then used by the decoder.\nAs the encoder processes the entire input all at once, every token can attend to every other token (all-to-all attention), so there is no need for causal masking.Decoder\nA decoder consists of an embedding layer, followed by multiple decoder layers, followed by an un-embedding layer.\nEach decoder consists of three major components: a causally masked self-attention mechanism, a cross-attention mechanism, and a feed-forward neural network. The decoder functions in a similar fashion to the encoder, but an additional attention mechanism is inserted which instead draws relevant information from the encodings generated by the encoders. This mechanism can also be called the encoder-decoder attention.\nLike the first encoder, the first decoder takes positional information and embeddings of the output sequence as its input, rather than encodings. The transformer must not use the current or future output to predict an output, so the output sequence must be partially masked to prevent this reverse information flow. This allows for autoregressive text generation. For decoding, all-to-all attention is inappropriate, because a token cannot attend to tokens not yet generated. Thus, the self-attention module in the decoder is causally masked.\nIn contrast, the cross-attention mechanism attends to the output vectors of the encoder, which is computed before the decoder starts decoding. Consequently, there is no need for masking in the cross-attention mechanism.\nSchematically, we have:\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                \n                  H\n                  \u2032\n                \n              \n              \n                \n                =\n                \n                  MaskedMultiheadedAttention\n                \n                (\n                H\n                ,\n                H\n                ,\n                H\n                )\n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  DecoderLayer\n                \n                (\n                H\n                )\n              \n              \n                \n                =\n                \n                  FFN\n                \n                (\n                \n                  MultiheadedAttention\n                \n                (\n                \n                  H\n                  \u2032\n                \n                ,\n                \n                  H\n                  \n                    E\n                  \n                \n                ,\n                \n                  H\n                  \n                    E\n                  \n                \n                )\n                )\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\begin{aligned}H'&={\\text{MaskedMultiheadedAttention}}(H,H,H)\\\\{\\text{DecoderLayer}}(H)&={\\text{FFN}}({\\text{MultiheadedAttention}}(H',H^{E},H^{E}))\\end{aligned}}}\n  \nwhere \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          H\n          \n            E\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle H^{E}}\n  \n is the matrix with rows being the output vectors from the encoder.\nThe last decoder is followed by a final un-embedding layer. to produce the output probabilities over the vocabulary. Then, one of the tokens is sampled according to the probability, and the decoder can be run again to produce the next token, etc, autoregressively generating output text.Adapted architectures\nMany large language models, since they do not need to predict a whole new sequence from an input sequence, only use the encoder or decoder of the original transformer architecture. Early GPT models are decoder-only models trained to predict the next token in a sequence. BERT, another language model, only makes use of an encoder, and is trained to predict a randomly masked token in a sequence.Full transformer architecture\nSublayers\nEach encoder layer contains 2 sublayers: the self-attention and the feedforward network. Each decoder layer contains 3 sublayers: the causally masked self-attention, the cross-attention, and the feedforward network.\n\nThe final points of detail are the residual connections and layer normalization (LayerNorm, or LN), which while conceptually unnecessary, are necessary for numerical stability and convergence.  \nThe residual connection, which is introduced to avoid vanishing gradient issues and stabilize the training process, can be expressed as follows: y = F(x) + x. The expression indicates that an output y is the sum of the transformation of input x (F(x)) and the input itself (x). Adding the input x can preserve the input information and avoid issues when the gradient of F(x) is close to zero.  \nSimilarly to how the feedforward network modules are applied individually to each vector, the LayerNorm is also applied individually to each vector. \nThere are two common conventions in use: the post-LN and the pre-LN convention. In the post-LN convention, the output of each sublayer is \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          L\n          a\n          y\n          e\n          r\n          N\n          o\n          r\n          m\n        \n        (\n        x\n        +\n        \n          S\n          u\n          b\n          l\n          a\n          y\n          e\n          r\n        \n        (\n        x\n        )\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {LayerNorm} (x+\\mathrm {Sublayer} (x))}\n  \nwhere \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          S\n          u\n          b\n          l\n          a\n          y\n          e\n          r\n        \n        (\n        x\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {Sublayer} (x)}\n  \n is the function implemented by the sublayer itself.\nIn the pre-LN convention, the output of each sublayer is\n  \n    \n      \n        x\n        +\n        \n          S\n          u\n          b\n          l\n          a\n          y\n          e\n          r\n        \n        (\n        \n          L\n          a\n          y\n          e\n          r\n          N\n          o\n          r\n          m\n        \n        (\n        x\n        )\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x+\\mathrm {Sublayer} (\\mathrm {LayerNorm} (x))}\n  \nThe original 2017 Transformer used the post-LN convention. It was difficult to train and required careful hyperparameter tuning and a \"warm-up\" in learning rate, where it starts small and gradually increases. The pre-LN convention, proposed several times in 2018, was found to be easier to train, requiring no warm-up, leading to faster convergence.Pseudocode\nThe following is the pseudocode for a standard pre-LN encoder-decoder Transformer, adapted from\n\ninput: Encoder input t_e\n       Decoder input t_d\noutput: Array of probability distributions, with shape (decoder vocabulary size x length(decoder output sequence))\n\n/* encoder */\nz_e \u2190 encoder.tokenizer(t_e)\n\nfor each t in 1:length(z_e) do\n    z_e[t] \u2190 encoder.embedding(z_e[t]) + encoder.positional_embedding(t)\n\nfor each l in 1:length(encoder.layers) do\n    layer \u2190 encoder.layers[l]\n\n    /* first sublayer */\n    z_e_copy \u2190 copy(z_e)\n    for each t in 1:length(z_e) do\n        z_e[t] \u2190 layer.layer_norm(z_e[t])\n    z_e \u2190 layer.multiheaded_attention(z_e, z_e, z_e)\n    for each t in 1:length(z_e) do\n        z_e[t] \u2190 z_e[t] + z_e_copy[t]\n\n    /* second sublayer */\n    z_e_copy \u2190 copy(z_e)\n    for each t in 1:length(z_e) do\n        z_e[t] \u2190 layer.layer_norm(z_e[t])\n    z_e \u2190 layer.feedforward(z_e)\n    for each t in 1:length(z_e) do\n        z_e[t] \u2190 z_e[t] + z_e_copy[t]\n\nfor each t in 1:length(z_e) do\n    z_e[t] \u2190 encoder.final_layer_norm(z_e[t])\n\n/* decoder */\nz_d \u2190 decoder.tokenizer(t_d)\n\nfor each t in 1:length(z_d) do\n    z_d[t] \u2190 decoder.embedding(z_d[t]) + decoder.positional_embedding(t)\n\nfor each l in 1:length(decoder.layers) do\n        layer \u2190 decoder.layers[l]\n\n        /* first sublayer */\n        z_d_copy \u2190 copy(z_d)\n        for each t in 1:length(z_d) do\n            z_d[t] \u2190 layer.layer_norm(z_d[t])\n        z_d \u2190 layer.masked_multiheaded_attention(z_d, z_d, z_d)\n        for each t in 1:length(z_d) do\n            z_d[t] \u2190 z_d[t] + z_d_copy[t]\n\n        /* second sublayer */\n        z_d_copy \u2190 copy(z_d)\n        for each t in 1:length(z_d) do\n            z_d[t] \u2190 layer.layer_norm(z_d[t])\n        z_d \u2190 layer.multiheaded_attention(z_d, z_e, z_e) \n        for each i in 1:length(z_d) do\n            z_d[t] \u2190 z_d[t] + z_d_copy[t]\n\n        /* third sublayer */\n        z_d_copy \u2190 copy(z_d)\n        for each t in 1:length(z_d) do\n            z_d[t] \u2190 layer.layer_norm(z_d[t])\n        z_d \u2190 layer.feedforward(z_d)\n        for each t in 1:length(z_d) do\n            z_d[t] \u2190 z_d[t] + z_d_copy[t]\n\nz_d \u2190 decoder.final_layer_norm(z_d)\n\noutput_distributions \u2190 []\nfor each t in 1:length(z_d) do\n    output_distributions.append(decoder.unembed(z_d[t]))\n\nreturn output_distributionsTerminology\nThe Transformer architecture, being modular, allows variations. Several common variations are described here.\nAn \"encoder-only\" Transformer applies the encoder to map an input text into a sequence of vectors that represent the input text. This is usually used for text embedding and representation learning for downstream applications. BERT is encoder-only. They are less often used currently, as they were found to be not significantly better than training an encoder-decoder Transformer, then taking just the encoder.\nA \"decoder-only\" Transformer is not literally decoder-only, since without an encoder, the cross-attention mechanism has nothing to attend to. Thus, the decoder layers in a decoder-only Transformer is composed of just two sublayers: the causally masked self-attention, and the feedforward network. This is usually used for text generation and instruction following. The models in the GPT series and Chinchilla series are decoder-only.\nAn \"encoder-decoder\" Transformer is generally the same as the original Transformer, with 2 sublayers per encoder layer and 3 sublayers per decoder layer, etc. They might have minor architectural improvements, such as alternative activation functions, changing the location of normalization, etc. This is also usually used for text generation and instruction following. The models in the T5 series are encoder-decoder.\nA \"prefixLM\" (prefix language model) is a decoder-only architecture, but with prefix masking, which is different from causal masking. Specifically, it has mask of the form:\u200aFigure 3\u200a\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          M\n          \n            prefixLM\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            [\n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    0\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \u2212\n                  \u221e\n                \n              \n              \n                \n                  \n                    0\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    M\n                    \n                      causal\n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n            ]\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle M_{\\text{prefixLM}}={\\begin{bmatrix}\\mathbf {0} &-\\infty \\\\\\mathbf {0} &M_{\\text{causal}}\\end{bmatrix}}}\n  \nwhere the first columns correspond to the \"prefix\", and the subsequent columns correspond to the autoregressively generated text based on the prefix. They resemble encoder-decoder models, but has less \"sparsity\". Such models are rarely used, though they are cited as theoretical possibilities and benchmarked comparisons.\nThere are also mixed seq2seq models. For example, in 2020, Google Translate replaced the previous RNN-encoder\u2013RNN-decoder model by a Transformer-encoder\u2013RNN-decoder model, on the argument that an RNN-decoder runs much faster than Transformer-decoder when run autoregressively.Subsequent work\nAlternative activation functions\nThe original transformer uses ReLU activation function. Other activation functions were developed. The Llama series and PaLM used SwiGLU; both GPT-1 and BERT used GELU. \nAlternative activation functions are often used in combination with Gated Linear Units in the feedforward module.Alternative normalizations\nThe normalization used in the Transformer can be different from LayerNorm. One example is RMSNorm which is used in the Llama series. Other examples include CapsuleNorm ScaleNorm, or FixNorm.Alternative positional encodings\nTransformers may use other positional encoding methods than sinusoidal. \nThe original Transformer paper reported using a learned positional encoding, but finding it not superior to the sinusoidal one. Later,  found that causal masking itself provides enough signal to a Transformer decoder that it can learn to implicitly perform absolute positional encoding without the positional encoding module.RoPE\nRoPE (rotary positional embedding), is best explained by considering a list of 2-dimensional vectors \n  \n    \n      \n        [\n        (\n        \n          x\n          \n            1\n          \n          \n            (\n            1\n            )\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          x\n          \n            1\n          \n          \n            (\n            2\n            )\n          \n        \n        )\n        ,\n        (\n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n          \n            (\n            1\n            )\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n          \n            (\n            2\n            )\n          \n        \n        )\n        ,\n        (\n        \n          x\n          \n            3\n          \n          \n            (\n            1\n            )\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          x\n          \n            3\n          \n          \n            (\n            2\n            )\n          \n        \n        )\n        ,\n        .\n        .\n        .\n        ]\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle [(x_{1}^{(1)},x_{1}^{(2)}),(x_{2}^{(1)},x_{2}^{(2)}),(x_{3}^{(1)},x_{3}^{(2)}),...]}\n  \n.

Since it is directly plugged into the attention mechanism, it can be combined with any positional encoder that is plugged into the \"bottom\" of the entire network (which is where the sinusoidal encoder on the original transformer, as well as RoPE and many others, are located).Relative Position Encodings\nRelative Position Encodings is similar to ALiBi, but more generic:\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                \n                  Attention\n                \n                (\n                Q\n                ,\n                K\n                ,\n                V\n                )\n                =\n                \n                  softmax\n                \n                \n                  (\n                  \n                    \n                      \n                        \n                          Q\n                          \n                            K\n                            \n                              \n                                T\n                              \n                            \n                          \n                        \n                        \n                          \n                            d\n                            \n                              k\n                            \n                          \n                        \n                      \n                    \n                    +\n                    B\n                  \n                  )\n                \n                V\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\begin{aligned}{\\text{Attention}}(Q,K,V)={\\text{softmax}}\\left({\\frac {QK^{\\mathrm {T} }}{\\sqrt {d_{k}}}}+B\\right)V\\end{aligned}}}\n  \nwhere \n  \n    \n      \n        B\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle B}\n  \n is a Toeplitz matrix, that is, \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          B\n          \n            i\n            ,\n            j\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          B\n          \n            \n              i\n              \u2032\n            \n            ,\n            \n              j\n              \u2032\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle B_{i,j}=B_{i',j'}}\n  \n whenever \n  \n    \n      \n        i\n        \u2212\n        j\n        =\n        \n          i\n          \u2032\n        \n        \u2212\n        \n          j\n          \u2032\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i-j=i'-j'}\n  \n. This is contrasted with the original sinusoidal positional encoding, which is an \"absolute positional encoding\".Efficient implementation\nThe transformer model has been implemented in standard deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch. Transformers is a library produced by Hugging Face that supplies transformer-based architectures and pretrained models.KV caching\nWhen an autoregressive transformer is used for inference, such as generating text, the query vector is different at each step, but the already-computed key and value vectors are always the same. The KV caching method saves the computed key and value vectors at each attention block, so that they are not recomputed at each new token. PagedAttention applies memory paging to KV caching.\nIf a transformer is used with a baked-in prompt, such as [\"You are a customer support agent...\"], then the key and value vectors can be computed for the prompt, and saved on disk. The saving in compute is significant when the model is used for many short interactions, such as in online chatbots.FlashAttention\nFlashAttention is an algorithm that implements the transformer attention mechanism efficiently on a GPU. It is a communication-avoiding algorithm that performs matrix multiplications in blocks, such that each block fits within the cache of a GPU, and by careful management of the blocks it minimizes data copying between GPU caches (as data movement is slow). See the page on softmax for details.\nAn improved version, FlashAttention-2, was developed to cater to the rising demand for language models capable of handling longer context lengths. It offers enhancements in work partitioning and parallelism, enabling it to achieve up to 230 TFLOPs/s on A100 GPUs (FP16/BF16), a 2x speed increase over the original FlashAttention.\nKey advancements in FlashAttention-2 include the reduction of non-matmul FLOPs, improved parallelism over the sequence length dimension, better work partitioning between GPU warps, and added support for head dimensions up to 256 and multi-query attention (MQA) and grouped-query attention (GQA).\nBenchmarks revealed FlashAttention-2 to be up to 2x faster than FlashAttention and up to 9x faster than a standard attention implementation in PyTorch. Future developments include optimization for new hardware like H100 GPUs and new data types like FP8.Multi-Query Attention\nMulti-Query Attention changes the multiheaded attention mechanism.

MQA is GQA with one group, while standard multiheaded attention is GQA with the maximal number of groups.\n\nMultihead Latent Attention (MLA) is a low-rank approximation to standard MHA. Specifically, each hidden vector, before entering the attention mechanism, is first projected to two low-dimensional spaces (\"latent space\"), one for query and one for key-value (KV vector). This design minimizes the KV cache, as only the low-dimensional KV vector needs to be cached.Speculative decoding\nSpeculative decoding is a method to accelerate token decoding. Similarly to speculative execution in CPUs, future tokens are computed quickly, then verified. If the quickly computed tokens are incorrect, they are discarded and computed slowly.\nThe key factor in speculative decoding is that a Transformer decoder can verify faster than it can decode, in the following sense.\nSuppose we have two transformer models like GPT-3 and GPT-3-small, both with a context window size of 512. To generate an entire context window autoregressively with greedy decoding with GPT-3, it must be run for 512 times, each time generating a token \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          x\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        ,\n        .\n        .\n        .\n        ,\n        \n          x\n          \n            512\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{512}}\n  \n, taking time \n  \n    \n      \n        512\n        \n          T\n          \n            GPT-3\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 512T_{\\text{GPT-3}}}\n  \n. However, if we had some educated guess for the values of these tokens, we could verify all of them in parallel, in one run of the model, by checking that each \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          x\n          \n            t\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x_{t}}\n  \n is indeed the token with the largest log-likelihood in the \n  \n    \n      \n        t\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle t}\n  \n-th output.\nIn speculative decoding, a smaller model or some other simple heuristic is used to generate a few speculative tokens that are subsequently verified by the larger model. For example, suppose we use GPT-3-small to generate four speculative tokens: \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                x\n                ~\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          \n            \n              \n                x\n                ~\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          \n            \n              \n                x\n                ~\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            3\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          \n            \n              \n                x\n                ~\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            4\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\tilde {x}}_{1},{\\tilde {x}}_{2},{\\tilde {x}}_{3},{\\tilde {x}}_{4}}\n  \n.

However, that vector can then be further processed by another Transformer block to predict the next token, and so on for arbitrarily many steps into the future. This trades off accuracy for speed, since each new token costs just one more Transformer block, rather than the entire stack.Sub-quadratic transformers\nTraining transformer-based architectures can be expensive, especially for long inputs. Many methods have been developed to attempt to address the issue. In the image domain, Swin Transformer is an efficient architecture that performs attention inside shifting windows. In the audio domain, SepTr decouples the attention in time and frequency domains. Long Range Arena (2020) is a standard benchmark for comparing the behavior of transformer architectures over long inputs.Alternative attention graphs\nThe standard attention graph is either all-to-all or causal, both of which scales as \n  \n    \n      \n        O\n        (\n        \n          N\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle O(N^{2})}\n  \n where \n  \n    \n      \n        N\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle N}\n  \n is the number of tokens in a sequence.\nReformer (2020) reduces the computational load from \n  \n    \n      \n        O\n        (\n        \n          N\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle O(N^{2})}\n  \n to \n  \n    \n      \n        O\n        (\n        N\n        ln\n        \u2061\n        N\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle O(N\\ln N)}\n  \n by using locality-sensitive hashing and reversible layers. \nSparse attention uses attention graphs that grows slower than \n  \n    \n      \n        O\n        (\n        \n          N\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle O(N^{2})}\n  \n.

Attention-free transformers reduce this to a linear dependence while still retaining the advantages of a transformer by linking the key to the value.Random Feature Attention\nRandom Feature Attention (2021) uses Fourier random features:\n  \n    \n      \n        \u03c6\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        =\n        \n          \n            1\n            \n              D\n            \n          \n        \n        [\n        cos\n        \u2061\n        \u27e8\n        \n          w\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        x\n        \u27e9\n        ,\n        sin\n        \u2061\n        \u27e8\n        \n          w\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        x\n        \u27e9\n        ,\n        \u22ef\n        cos\n        \u2061\n        \u27e8\n        \n          w\n          \n            D\n          \n        \n        ,\n        x\n        \u27e9\n        ,\n        sin\n        \u2061\n        \u27e8\n        \n          w\n          \n            D\n          \n        \n        ,\n        x\n        \u27e9\n        \n          ]\n          \n            T\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\varphi (x)={\\frac {1}{\\sqrt {D}}}[\\cos \\langle w_{1},x\\rangle ,\\sin \\langle w_{1},x\\rangle ,\\cdots \\cos \\langle w_{D},x\\rangle ,\\sin \\langle w_{D},x\\rangle ]^{T}}\n  \nwhere \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          w\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        .\n        .\n        .\n        ,\n        \n          w\n          \n            D\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle w_{1},...,w_{D}}\n  \n are independent samples from the normal distribution \n  \n    \n      \n        N\n        (\n        0\n        ,\n        \n          \u03c3\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        I\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle N(0,\\sigma ^{2}I)}\n  \n.

A 2022 study found that Transformers pretrained only on natural language can be finetuned on only 0.03% of parameters and become competitive with LSTMs on a variety of logical and visual tasks, demonstrating transfer learning. The LLaVA was a vision-language model composed of a language model (Vicuna-13B) and a vision model (ViT-L/14), connected by a linear layer. Only the linear layer is finetuned.\nVision transformers adapt the transformer to computer vision by breaking down input images as a series of patches, turning them into vectors, and treating them like tokens in a standard transformer.\nConformer and later Whisper follow the same pattern for speech recognition, first turning the speech signal into a spectrogram, which is then treated like an image, i.e. broken down into a series of patches, turned into vectors and treated like tokens in a standard transformer.\nPerceivers are a variant of Transformers designed for multimodality.\nFor image generation, notable architectures are DALL-E 1 (2021), Parti (2022), Phenaki (2023), and Muse (2023). Unlike later models, DALL-E is not a diffusion model. Instead, it uses a decoder-only Transformer that autoregressively generates a text, followed by the token representation of an image, which is then converted by a variational autoencoder to an image. Parti is an encoder-decoder Transformer, where the encoder processes a text prompt, and the decoder generates a token representation of an image. Muse is an encoder-only Transformer that is trained to predict masked image tokens from unmasked image tokens. During generation, all input tokens are masked, and the highest-confidence predictions are included for the next iteration, until all tokens are predicted. Phenaki is a text-to-video model. It is a bidirectional masked transformer conditioned on pre-computed text tokens. The generated tokens are then decoded to a video.Applications\nThe transformer has had great success in natural language processing (NLP). Many large language models such as GPT-2, GPT-3, GPT-4, Gemini, AlbertAGPT, Claude, BERT, Grok, XLNet, RoBERTa and ChatGPT demonstrate the ability of transformers to perform a wide variety of NLP-related subtasks and their related real-world applications, including:\n\nmachine translation\ntime series prediction\ndocument summarization\ndocument generation\nnamed entity recognition (NER)\nwriting computer code based on requirements expressed in natural language.\nspeech-to-text\nBeyond traditional NLP, the transformer architecture has had success in other applications, such as:\n\nbiological sequence analysis\nvideo understanding\nprotein folding (such as AlphaFold)\nevaluating chess board positions. Using static evaluation alone (that is, with no Minimax search) transformer achieved an Elo of 2895, putting it at grandmaster level.See also\nseq2seq \u2013 Family of machine learning approaches\nPerceiver \u2013 Variant of Transformer designed for multimodal data\nVision transformer \u2013 Machine learning model for vision processing\nLarge language model \u2013 Type of machine learning model\nBERT (language model) \u2013 Series of language models developed by Google AI\nGenerative pre-trained transformer \u2013 Type of large language model\nT5 (language model) \u2013 Series of large language models developed by Google AINotes\nReferences\n== Further reading ==", "result": "# Introduction\n\nIn deep learning, the transformer is a neural network architecture introduced in the 2017 paper \"Attention Is All You Need\" by Google AI researchers. It was designed to serve as a general-purpose component for sequence-to-sequence tasks that use sequential data. It is primarily used in natural language processing (NLP), where it powers most state-of-the-art models for machine translation, text summarization, and text classification.\n\nThe transformer improves upon recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and their variants, such as LSTM and GRU, which process sequences in a linear, sequential manner. In contrast, the transformer captures relationships between all items in a sequence through attention mechanisms, allowing it to better capture the context and semantics of a text. This allows it to generalize more easily to new data, and reduces the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning.\n\nOver time, the architecture has evolved to include improvements such as better attention mechanisms, parallelizable versions of RNNs, and hybrid models combining multiple neural network architectures. These advancements have led to the development of large-scale foundation models such as GPT-3, PaLM, and Llama, which have demonstrated impressive performance in a wide range of tasks.\n\nWhile the transformer architecture was originally designed for NLP, it has since been applied to other modalities, including computer vision and audio. However, its performance remains most notable in the realm of NLP.\n\nThe term \"transformer\" originates from the idea that the architecture transforms one representation of the data into another\u2014e.g., from sentence embeddings to probabilities over words in a vocabulary\u2014or vice versa.\n\n History\n\nThe Transformer architecture was first introduced in the 2017 paper \"Attention Is All You Need\" by Google AI researchers. It built upon earlier work on attention mechanisms and sequence-to-sequence learning. The paper demonstrated the effectiveness of the Transformer in machine translation tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks.\n\nSince its introduction, the Transformer has become a cornerstone of deep learning research and has inspired numerous advancements in neural network architectures. Its success has driven innovation in various fields, including natural language processing, computer vision, and speech recognition.\n\n Predecessors\n\nThe Transformer architecture builds upon several earlier developments in deep learning, including:\n\n* Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): Introduced in the 1990s, RNNs process sequential data by propagating information through hidden states. While effective, they suffer from challenges such as vanishing and exploding gradients, which limit their ability to capture long-range dependencies.\n* Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM): Introduced in 1997, LSTMs are a variant of RNNs designed to address the vanishing gradient problem. They use gating mechanisms to control the flow of information through the network, enabling them to learn and retain long-term dependencies.\n* Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU): Introduced in 2014, GRUs are a simplified variant of LSTMs that combine the input and forget gates into a single update gate. This simplification reduces computational complexity while retaining the ability to capture long-term dependencies.\n* Sequence-to-Sequence Learning: Introduced in the 2014 paper \"Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate,\" sequence-to-sequence learning involves encoding an input sequence and decoding it into an output sequence. This framework has been widely used for tasks such as machine translation, text summarization, and speech recognition.\n* Attention Mechanisms: Introduced in the 1990s and popularized in the 2017 paper \"Show, Attend and Tell,\" attention mechanisms allow models to focus on different parts of the input sequence when generating output tokens. By dynamically weighting the importance of different elements, attention mechanisms enable models to capture global context and improve performance on various tasks.\n\nThese developments collectively laid the groundwork for the Transformer architecture, which addresses some of the limitations of previous approaches by leveraging attention mechanisms to capture global dependencies in a parallelizable manner.\n\n Attention with seq2seq\n\nAttention mechanisms were initially introduced for image captioning\u00a0<cit.> and machine translation\u00a0<cit.>. In the context of seq2seq models, attention mechanisms help bridge the gap between the source and target languages by allowing the decoder to attend to different parts of the source sequence when generating each output token. This enables the model to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence and capture long-range dependencies.\n\nThe original attention mechanism, proposed in the paper \"Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate\"\u00a0<cit.>, is based on a scoring function that computes a similarity score between each part of the source sequence and the current decoder state. The scores are then normalized using a softmax function to obtain attention weights, which determine the contribution of each source token to the context vector. The context vector is then used to generate the next output token.\n\nSubsequent work introduced various improvements to the attention mechanism, such as additive attention\u00a0<cit.>, multiplicative attention\u00a0<cit.>, and scaled dot-product attention\u00a0<cit.>. These improvements addressed issues such as computational efficiency, scalability, and the ability to capture global context.\n\nThe attention mechanism proved to be highly effective in improving the performance of seq2seq models, particularly in tasks such as machine translation, text summarization, and speech recognition. As a result, it became a core component of many state-of-the-art models in these domains.\n\nThe development of the Transformer architecture built upon these advancements in attention mechanisms, introducing a novel approach that eliminates recurrence altogether and relies solely on attention mechanisms to capture dependencies between input and output sequences.\n\n Parallelizing attention\n\nThe original seq2seq models with attention, such as the one described in the paper \"Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate\"\u00a0<cit.>, were trained using a recurrent architecture. This means that at each step of the decoding process, the model had to sequentially process the input sequence and update its internal state.\n\nThis sequential nature of the computation made it difficult to take advantage of modern hardware, such as GPUs, which are designed for parallel processing. To overcome this limitation, researchers developed parallelizable versions of the recurrent architecture, such as the bidirectional RNN (BRNN)\u00a0<cit.> and the multi-layer perceptron (MLP)\u00a0<cit.>.\n\nHowever, these approaches still relied on recurrence and did not fully eliminate the sequential nature of the computation. The Transformer architecture, introduced in the 2017 paper \"Attention Is All You Need\"\u00a0<cit.>, represented a significant breakthrough by eliminating recurrence altogether and relying solely on attention mechanisms to capture dependencies between input and output sequences.\n\nBy doing so, the Transformer enabled efficient parallel processing of both the encoding and decoding phases, making it possible to take full advantage of modern hardware and significantly accelerate training and inference times. This led to a dramatic improvement in the scalability and efficiency of neural network models for sequence-to-sequence tasks.\n\n AI boom era\n\nFollowing the introduction of the Transformer architecture, there has been a rapid advancement in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in the area of natural language processing (NLP). The Transformer architecture has become a cornerstone of NLP research, driving innovation in a wide range of applications such as machine translation, text summarization, sentiment analysis, question answering, and more.\n\nOne of the key factors driving the success of the Transformer architecture is its ability to capture long-range dependencies and contextual information in text. Unlike traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and their variants, which process sequences sequentially, the Transformer uses attention mechanisms to allow the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence simultaneously. This enables the Transformer to capture global dependencies and contextual information more effectively, resulting in improved performance on a wide range of NLP tasks.\n\nIn addition to its effectiveness, the Transformer architecture has also contributed to the democratization of AI. The open-source nature of the architecture, along with the availability of large-scale language models such as BERT\u00a0<cit.>, GPT-2\u00a0<cit.>, and GPT-3\u00a0<cit.>, has made it easier than ever for researchers and developers to experiment with and build upon these models. This has led to a proliferation of NLP applications across a wide range of domains, from healthcare and finance to customer service and marketing.\n\nAs the field of AI continues to evolve, the Transformer architecture is likely to remain a central component of NLP research and development. With ongoing efforts to improve the efficiency, scalability, and interpretability of these models, we can expect to see even more exciting advances in the years to come.\n\n Training\n\nTraining a transformer model typically involves the following steps:\n\n* Tokenization: The input text is broken down into individual tokens (e.g., words, subwords, or characters) using a tokenizer.\n* Embedding: Each token is mapped to a high-dimensional vector using an embedding layer.\n* Transformer layers: The embedded tokens are passed through a series of transformer layers, which consist of self-attention mechanisms and feed-forward neural networks. The self-attention mechanism allows the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence and capture contextual information, while the feed-forward network learns nonlinear transformations of the attended representations.\n* Layer normalization: Layer normalization is applied after each transformer layer to stabilize the training process and improve convergence.\n* Pooling and projection: The final representation of the input sequence is obtained by pooling (e.g., taking the mean or maximum) over the transformer outputs and projecting the resulting representation to the desired output space (e.g., the number of classes in a classification task or the size of the vocabulary in a language modeling task).\n* Loss computation: The predicted output is compared to the ground truth using an appropriate loss function (e.g., cross-entropy loss for classification tasks or mean squared error for regression tasks), and the resulting loss is backpropagated through the model to update the parameters.\n* Optimization: The model parameters are updated using an optimization algorithm such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adam, or Adagrad.\n\nDuring training, the goal is to minimize the loss function by adjusting the model parameters using gradient descent. This is typically done by iterating over a dataset of input-output pairs, computing the predictions using the forward pass, computing the loss using the loss function, and updating the parameters using the backpropagation algorithm and an optimization algorithm.\n\nThere are several techniques that can be used to improve the training of transformer models, such as curriculum learning, which gradually increases the difficulty of the training examples, and adaptive learning rates, which adjust the learning rate during training to improve convergence.\n\n Methods for stabilizing training\n\nTraining transformer models can be challenging due to issues such as vanishing and exploding gradients, which can make it difficult to train deep networks. Several methods have been proposed to address these challenges and stabilize the training process:\n\n* Warmup and decay: During the early stages of training, it can be helpful to start with a small learning rate and gradually increase it to a higher value. This is known as a learning rate warmup. Conversely, during the later stages of training, it can be helpful to gradually decrease the learning rate to a lower value. This is known as learning rate decay. Together, these techniques can help prevent the learning rate from being too large or too small at any given point in training, which can lead to instability in the training process.\n* Layer normalization: Layer normalization is a technique that is applied to each layer of the transformer model to normalize the activations of the neurons in the layer. This helps to stabilize the activations and reduce the internal covariate shift, which can occur when the distribution of the inputs to a layer changes over the course of training. By normalizing the activations, layer normalization can help to prevent the gradients from becoming too large or too small during backpropagation, which can lead to instability in the training process.\n\n Pretrain-finetune\n\nPretraining and fine-tuning are two important techniques used in deep learning to improve the performance of neural networks on specific tasks.\n\nPretraining refers to the process of training a neural network on a large, general-purpose dataset before applying it to a specific task. The idea behind pretraining is to learn useful features or representations of the data that can be reused across multiple tasks. For example, a neural network trained on a large corpus of text might learn to represent words and phrases in a way that is useful for a wide range of natural language processing tasks, such as sentiment analysis, language translation, or text classification.\n\nFine-tuning, on the other hand, refers to the process of adapting a pre-trained neural network to a specific task by updating its parameters using labeled data specific to that task. Fine-tuning typically involves starting with a pre-trained network and adding or modifying layers to match the output dimensionality of the task at hand. The pre-trained layers are then fine-tuned using a small amount of labeled data specific to the task, which allows the network to learn task-specific features and adapt to the nuances of the task.\n\nOne common approach to pretraining and fine-tuning is to use a large, general-purpose dataset to pretrain a neural network, and then fine-tune the network on smaller, domain-specific datasets to improve its performance on specific tasks. For example, a neural network pre-trained on a large corpus of text might be fine-tuned on a dataset of medical records to improve its performance on tasks related to medical diagnosis or patient classification.\n\nPretraining and fine-tuning have proven to be effective techniques for improving the performance of deep learning models on a wide range of tasks, and they are widely used in areas such as natural language processing, computer vision, and speech recognition.\n\n Tasks\n\nLanguage modeling is a type of machine learning task that involves predicting the probability of a sequence of words or tokens in a sentence or paragraph. There are three main types of language modeling: masked language modeling, autoregressive language modeling, and prefix language modeling.\n\nMasked language modeling is a type of language modeling where the model is trained to predict the probability of each word in a sentence, given the surrounding words. However, some of the words in the sentence are replaced with a special token, such as [MASK], and the model is trained to predict the probability of the masked token based on the context provided by the surrounding words. This type of language modeling is often used for tasks such as filling in the blanks or predicting missing words in a sentence.\n\nAutoregressive language modeling is a type of language modeling where the model is trained to predict the probability of the next word in a sentence, given the preceding words. The model is trained to predict the probability of each word in the sentence, conditioned on the previously predicted words. This type of language modeling is often used for tasks such as text generation or translation, where the model needs to generate a sequence of words based on the context provided by the preceding words.\n\nPrefix language modeling is a type of language modeling where the model is trained to predict the probability of the remaining words in a sentence, given a prefix of the sentence. The prefix can be a single word or a sequence of words, and the model is trained to predict the probability of the remaining words in the sentence based on the context provided by the prefix. This type of language modeling is often used for tasks such as text summarization or question answering, where the model needs to generate a response based on a partial input.\n\nThe language modeling task is typically formulated as a probabilistic model, where the goal is to estimate the probability of a sequence of words or tokens, denoted as w_1, w_2, ..., w_n. The probability of the sequence can be expressed as the product of the conditional probabilities of each word given the preceding words:\n\n    p(w_1, w_2, ..., w_n) = \u220f_i=1^n p(w_i | w_1, w_2, ..., w_i-1)\n\nwhere p(w_i | w_1, w_2, ..., w_i-1) is the conditional probability of word w_i given the preceding words w_1, w_2, ..., w_i-1.\n\nIn practice, it is often more convenient to work with the log-probability of the sequence, which can be expressed as:\n\n    log p(w_1, w_2, ..., w_n) = \u2211_i=1^n log p(w_i | w_1, w_2, ..., w_i-1)\n\nThe language modeling task can be framed as an optimization problem, where the goal is to find the sequence of words that maximizes the probability or log-probability of the sequence. This can be written as:\n\n    max_w_1, w_2, ..., w_n p(w_1, w_2, ..., w_n)\n\nor equivalently,\n\n    max_w_1, w_2, ..., w_n \u2211_i=1^n log p(w_i | w_1, w_2, ..., w_i-1)\n\nThere are several algorithms for solving this optimization problem, including gradient-based methods such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants, as well as sampling-based methods such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and approximate inference methods such as variational inference (VI) and Monte Carlo dropout (MCDO).\n\nThe language modeling task is a fundamental building block for many NLP tasks, such as text generation, translation, and summarization. By learning to model the probability distributions of words and sentences, language models can be used to generate coherent and contextually relevant text, translate between languages, and summarize long documents in a concise and informative way.\n\n Architecture\n\nThe Transformer architecture is composed of several key components, including tokenizers, embedding layers, transformer layers, and an un-embedding layer. These components work together to convert raw text into a format that can be processed by the model and generate predictions or translations.\n\nTokenizers\n\nThe first step in the Transformer pipeline is tokenization, which involves breaking down raw text into smaller units called tokens. Tokens can be individual words, subwords, or characters, depending on the specific tokenizer being used. The choice of tokenizer can have a significant impact on the performance of the Transformer model, as it affects the granularity of the input representation and the size of the vocabulary.\n\nEmbedding\n\nAfter tokenization, the tokens are mapped to high-dimensional vectors using an embedding layer. The embedding layer is a lookup table that assigns a unique vector to each token in the vocabulary. The embeddings capture semantic and syntactic information about the tokens and serve as the initial representation of the input sequence.\n\nTransformer layers\n\nThe core component of the Transformer architecture is the transformer layer, which consists of two main sub-layers: the self-attention mechanism and the feed-forward neural network. The self-attention mechanism allows the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence and capture contextual information, while the feed-forward network learns nonlinear transformations of the attended representations.\n\nThe self-attention mechanism computes a weighted sum of the input sequence, where the weights are determined by the similarity between each pair of tokens in the sequence. This allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence when generating each output token, taking into account the context provided by the surrounding tokens.\n\nThe feed-forward network is a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) that applies nonlinear transformations to the attended representations. The feed-forward network is applied separately to each position in the sequence, allowing the model to learn position-independent features that are invariant to the order of the tokens.\n\nThe output of the transformer layer is passed through a layer normalization layer, which normalizes the activations of the layer to stabilize the training process and improve convergence.\n\nUn-embedding\n\nThe final step in the Transformer pipeline is the un-embedding layer, which converts the high-dimensional vector representations generated by the transformer layers back into tokens. The un-embedding layer is essentially the inverse of the embedding layer, mapping the vector representations to the corresponding tokens in the output sequence.\n\nThe output of the un-embedding layer is a probability distribution over the vocabulary, representing the likelihood of each token being the next token in the sequence. The token with the highest probability is selected as the predicted token, and the process is repeated for the next timestep until a stopping criterion is met.\n\n Tokenization\n\nTokenization is the process of converting raw text into a format that can be understood by the Transformer model. The process involves breaking down the text into smaller units called tokens, which are then mapped to numerical representations called token IDs. The choice of tokenizer can have a significant impact on the performance of the Transformer model, as it affects the granularity of the input representation and the size of the vocabulary.\n\nThere are several popular tokenization methods used in Transformer models, including word-level tokenization, subword-level tokenization, and character-level tokenization. Word-level tokenization involves splitting the text into individual words, while subword-level tokenization involves splitting the text into smaller subunits that may not correspond to whole words but are meaningful units of language. Character-level tokenization involves splitting the text into individual characters.\n\nOne popular subword-level tokenizer is the SentencePiece tokenizer, which was developed by Google. The SentencePiece tokenizer is a subword-level tokenizer that combines the advantages of both word-level and character-level tokenization. It operates by training a statistical model on a corpus of text to identify the most frequent sequences of characters and assign them unique identifiers. These sequences of characters are called \"SentencePieces\" and can be either unigram or n-gram tokens.\n\nThe SentencePiece tokenizer has several advantages over other tokenization methods. First, it can handle out-of-vocabulary words by breaking them down into subword units that have already been seen during training. This makes it particularly useful for tasks such as machine translation and text generation, where the input text may contain words that were not present in the training data. Second, the SentencePiece tokenizer produces a fixed-size vocabulary, which can simplify the training process and improve the efficiency of the model. Finally, the SentencePiece tokenizer has been shown to perform well on a variety of tasks and has become a popular choice for Transformer-based models.\n\n Embedding\n\nThe embedding layer in the Transformer architecture is responsible for transforming the input tokens into dense, low-dimensional vectors that capture the semantic and syntactic information of the input sequence. The embedding layer is a crucial component of the Transformer architecture because it provides the initial representation of the input sequence and serves as the starting point for the attention mechanism.\n\nThe embedding layer is implemented as a lookup table, where each token in the vocabulary is mapped to a unique vector. The vectors are initialized randomly and learned during training, allowing the model to discover the most effective representation for the task at hand.\n\nThe embedding layer takes the input tokens as input and outputs a tensor of shape (batch_size, seq_len, d_model), where batch_size is the number of input sequences in the batch, seq_len is the length of each input sequence, and d_model is the dimensionality of the embedding vectors. The embedding layer also accepts a parameter called padding_idx, which is used to pad the input sequences to ensure that they have the same length.\n\nThe embedding layer can be implemented using various initialization methods, such as uniform initialization, normal initialization, or Xavier initialization. The choice of initialization method can affect the convergence and performance of the model, and it is often necessary to experiment with different methods to find the best one for a particular task.\n\nUn-embedding\n\nThe un-embedding layer in the Transformer architecture is responsible for converting the output logits of the model back into token probabilities. The un-embedding layer is essentially the inverse of the embedding layer, which maps token indices to dense vectors.\n\nThe un-embedding layer takes the output logits of the model, which are of shape (batch_size, seq_len, vocab_size), where batch_size is the number of input sequences in the batch, seq_len is the length of each input sequence, and vocab_size is the size of the vocabulary. The un-embedding layer then applies a softmax function along the last dimension of the logits to produce probabilities over the vocabulary for each token in the sequence.\n\nThe output of the un-embedding layer is a tensor of shape (batch_size, seq_len, vocab_size), where each element represents the probability of the corresponding token in the vocabulary. These probabilities can be used to select the most probable token for each position in the sequence, or they can be used as inputs to downstream tasks such as language modeling or machine translation.\n\nThe un-embedding layer is implemented using a simple matrix multiplication between the logits and the transpose of the embedding matrix. Specifically, if E is the embedding matrix of shape (vocab_size, d_model), where d_model is the dimensionality of the embedding vectors, and Z is the logits tensor of shape (batch_size, seq_len, d_model), then the un-embedding layer computes the probabilities P as follows:\n\n    P = softmax(Z \u00b7 E^T)\n\nwhere \u00b7 denotes the matrix multiplication operation and softmax is the softmax function applied along the last dimension of the resulting tensor.\n\nPositional encoding\n\nPositional encoding is a technique used in the Transformer architecture to provide information about the position of each token in the input sequence. The positional encoding is added to the embedding vectors before passing them through the attention mechanism.\n\nThe positional encoding is a learnable parameter that is added to the embedding vectors. The positional encoding is a sinusoidal function of the position and the dimension index, which allows the model to learn the relative position of each token in the sequence. The positional encoding is designed to have a periodicity that covers the maximum input length, which ensures that the model can handle sequences of varying lengths.\n\nThe positional encoding is added to the embedding vectors before passing them through the attention mechanism. This allows the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence and capture contextual information, while taking into account the position of each token in the sequence.\n\nEncoder-decoder (overview)\n\nThe Transformer architecture consists of an encoder and a decoder, which work together to process the input sequence and generate the output sequence. The encoder processes the input sequence and produces a sequence of hidden states, which are then passed to the decoder to generate the output sequence.\n\nThe encoder is composed of a stack of transformer layers, each of which consists of a self-attention mechanism and a feed-forward neural network. The self-attention mechanism allows the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence and capture contextual information, while the feed-forward neural network learns nonlinear transformations of the attended representations.\n\nThe decoder is also composed of a stack of transformer layers, but each layer includes an additional mechanism called the attention mechanism. The attention mechanism allows the decoder to attend to the hidden states produced by the encoder, as well as to the current output sequence, when generating each output token. This allows the decoder to incorporate information from the encoder into the output sequence and generate contextually relevant tokens.\n\nThe encoder and decoder are connected by a causal attention mechanism, which ensures that the decoder only attends to the tokens that have already been generated at each timestep. This prevents the model from cheating by attending to future tokens and ensures that the output sequence is generated in a sequential manner.\n\n Feedforward network\n\nThe feed-forward network in the Transformer architecture is a critical component that enables the model to learn complex non-linear relationships between input and output tokens. It consists of two fully connected layers with a non-linear activation function in between.\n\nThe first fully connected layer takes the output of the multi-head attention mechanism and applies a linear transformation to it, increasing its dimensionality. The resulting output is then passed through a non-linear activation function, such as the rectified linear unit (ReLU) or GELU (Gaussian Error Linear Unit), which introduces non-linearity to the model.\n\nThe second fully connected layer then applies another linear transformation to the activated output, reducing its dimensionality back to the original size of the input embeddings. Dropout regularization is often applied to the output of this layer to prevent overfitting.\n\nThe feed-forward network operates independently for each position in the sequence, allowing the model to learn position-independent features that are invariant to the order of the tokens. Additionally, the feed-forward network is applied to each position in parallel, making it computationally efficient.\n\n Scaled dot-product attention\n\nScaled dot-product attention is a type of attention mechanism used in the Transformer architecture to compute the relevance scores between the query and key vectors. The attention mechanism is a core component of the Transformer architecture, which allows the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence when generating each output token.\n\nThe scaled dot-product attention is defined as follows:\n\n    Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QK^T/\u221a(d_k))V\n\nwhere Q, K, and V are the query, key, and value vectors, respectively, and d_k is the dimensionality of the key vectors.\n\nThe dot-product attention computes the dot product between the query vector and each key vector, which measures the similarity between the query and key vectors. The resulting similarity scores are then passed through a softmax function to produce a probability distribution over the keys. Finally, the probability distribution is multiplied by the value vectors to produce the weighted sum of the values, which is the output of the attention mechanism.\n\nThe scaled version of the dot-product attention adds a scaling factor of 1/\u221a(d_k) to the dot product before applying the softmax function. This scaling factor helps to stabilize the attention scores and prevent the softmax function from producing extreme values, which can cause numerical instability during training.\n\nThe attention mechanism is a key component of the Transformer architecture, which allows the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence when generating each output token. The scaled dot-product attention is a computationally efficient implementation of the attention mechanism that has been widely adopted in practice.\n\n Attention head\n\nThe attention head in the Transformer architecture is a module that computes attention scores between the query, key, and value vectors for a given set of input tokens. The attention head is a key component of the Transformer architecture, which allows the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence when generating each output token.\n\nThe attention head is defined as follows:\n\n    Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QK^T/\u221a(d_k))V\n\nwhere Q, K, and V are the query, key, and value vectors, respectively, and d_k is the dimensionality of the key vectors.\n\nThe query, key, and value vectors are computed by passing the input tokens through three separate linear projections, which transform the input embeddings into vectors of dimensionality d_k. The query vector is used to compute the similarity scores between the input tokens, while the key and value vectors are used to store the contextual information that will be attended to.\n\nThe attention scores are computed by taking the dot product between the query vector and each key vector, which measures the similarity between the query and key vectors. The resulting similarity scores are then passed through a softmax function to produce a probability distribution over the keys. Finally, the probability distribution is multiplied by the value vectors to produce the weighted sum of the values, which is the output of the attention head.\n\nThe attention head is a key component of the Transformer architecture, which allows the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence when generating each output token. By computing attention scores between the query, key, and value vectors, the attention head enables the model to capture contextual information and generate contextually relevant output tokens.\n\n Multiheaded attention\n\nMulti-headed attention is a mechanism used in the Transformer architecture to allow the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions. This mechanism involves computing multiple attention heads in parallel, each with its own set of parameters, and then concatenating the results before applying a final linear projection.\n\nEach attention head computes a weighted sum of the input vectors, where the weights are determined by the dot product between the query vector and the key vectors, scaled by the square root of the key vector dimensionality. The resulting weighted sums are then summed across all heads and passed through a linear projection to produce the final output.\n\nThe use of multiple attention heads allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions, which has been shown to improve performance on a variety of natural language processing tasks. The number of attention heads is a hyperparameter that can be tuned to balance computational cost and performance.\n\n Masked attention\n\nMasked attention is a technique used in the Transformer architecture to ensure that the model does not attend to future tokens during decoding. This is important because the Transformer architecture uses self-attention to compute a weighted sum of all tokens in the input sequence when generating each output token, which means that the model could potentially attend to future tokens during decoding and generate incorrect outputs.\n\nTo prevent this, masked attention is used to set the attention scores for future tokens to a very low value, effectively masking them out of the attention computation. This is typically achieved by setting the attention scores for future tokens to negative infinity before applying the softmax function to compute the attention weights.\n\nThere are two common ways to implement masked attention in the Transformer architecture. The first is to use a causal mask, which is a binary mask that sets the attention scores for future tokens to zero. The second is to use a triangular mask, which is a lower triangular matrix of zeros that sets the attention scores for future tokens to negative infinity.\n\nBoth of these methods ensure that the model only attends to past tokens during decoding, which preserves the auto-regressive property of the Transformer architecture and prevents the model from cheating by attending to future tokens.\n\n Encoder\n\nThe encoder is a crucial component of the Transformer architecture, which is used for processing input sequences in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. It consists of a stack of transformer layers, each of which contains multi-headed self-attention and feed-forward modules.\n\nThe encoder is designed to capture the contextual information of the input tokens and generate a sequence of hidden states that can be used by the decoder to generate the output sequence. The encoder is typically followed by a linear projection layer that maps the hidden states to the output space, which is then used to compute the probabilities of the output tokens.\n\nThe encoder is composed of several sub-components, including:\n\n* Input embedding: The input tokens are mapped to dense vectors using an embedding layer.\n* Positional encoding: The positional encoding is added to the input embeddings to provide information about the position of each token in the sequence.\n* Transformer layers: The encoder consists of a stack of transformer layers, each of which contains multi-headed self-attention and feed-forward modules.\n* Layer normalization: The output of each transformer layer is passed through a layer normalization layer to stabilize the training process and improve convergence.\n\nThe encoder is trained end-to-end with the decoder using a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. During training, the encoder is trained to predict the next token in a sequence given the previous tokens, and the decoder is trained to generate the correct output sequence given the encoded representation of the input sequence.\n\n Decoder\n\nThe decoder is a crucial component of the Transformer architecture, which is used for generating output sequences in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. It consists of a stack of transformer layers, each of which contains multi-headed self-attention and feed-forward modules.\n\nThe decoder is designed to generate output tokens based on the encoded representation of the input sequence produced by the encoder. It uses a causal attention mechanism to ensure that the output tokens are generated in a sequential manner, with each token being generated based on the previously generated tokens and the encoded representation of the input sequence.\n\nThe decoder is composed of several sub-components, including:\n\n* Input embedding: The input tokens are mapped to dense vectors using an embedding layer.\n* Positional encoding: The positional encoding is added to the input embeddings to provide information about the position of each token in the sequence.\n* Transformer layers: The decoder consists of a stack of transformer layers, each of which contains multi-headed self-attention and feed-forward modules.\n* Cross-attention: The decoder uses a cross-attention mechanism to attend to the encoded representation of the input sequence when generating each output token.\n* Output projection: The output of the decoder is passed through a linear projection layer to produce the probabilities of the output tokens.\n\nThe decoder is trained end-to-end with the encoder using a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. During training, the decoder is trained to generate the correct output sequence given the encoded representation of the input sequence and the previously generated tokens.\n\n Adapted architectures\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) typically use the encoder or decoder components of the transformer architecture to process input sequences and generate output sequences. The encoder is commonly used for tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and named entity recognition, while the decoder is used for tasks such as text generation, machine translation, and conversation modeling.\n\nOne popular example of an LLM that uses the encoder component of the transformer architecture is the GPT-3 model, which is trained on a large corpus of text data and can be fine-tuned for a wide range of NLP tasks. Another example is the BERT model, which uses a bidirectional encoder architecture and has achieved state-of-the-art performance on a variety of NLP tasks.\n\nSimilarly, LLMs that use the decoder component of the transformer architecture include the T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) model, which is trained on a large corpus of text and can be used for a variety of tasks that involve generating text, such as question answering and summarization. Another example is the GPT-2 (Generative Pretrained Transformer 2) model, which is similar to GPT-3 but has a smaller number of parameters and can still achieve strong performance on a variety of NLP tasks.\n\n Full transformer architecture\n\nThe full transformer architecture is composed of several key components, including the embedding layer, the encoder, the decoder, and the output layer. The embedding layer maps each input token to a high-dimensional vector representation, which is then passed through the encoder to produce a sequence of hidden states.\n\nThe encoder consists of a stack of transformer blocks, each of which is composed of a multi-head self-attention mechanism and a feed-forward neural network. The multi-head self-attention mechanism allows the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence simultaneously, while the feed-forward neural network allows the model to learn nonlinear transformations of the hidden states.\n\nThe decoder is also composed of a stack of transformer blocks, but it includes an additional attention mechanism called the cross-attention mechanism. The cross-attention mechanism allows the decoder to attend to the hidden states produced by the encoder, as well as to the current output sequence, when generating each output token.\n\nThe output layer maps the final hidden states of the decoder to the probability distribution over the output vocabulary, which is then used to select the most probable output token at each timestep.\n\n Sublayers\n\nThe transformer architecture consists of a stack of transformer layers, each of which is composed of several sublayers. The sublayers in the transformer architecture are:\n\n* Multi-headed self-attention: This sublayer computes attention scores between the query, key, and value vectors for a given set of input tokens. The attention scores are then used to compute a weighted sum of the input tokens, which is then passed through a linear projection to produce the output of the sublayer.\n* Layer normalization: This sublayer is used to normalize the output of the multi-headed self-attention sublayer by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of the output, and then scaling and shifting by trainable parameters.\n* Position-wise feed-forward network: This sublayer is a fully connected feed-forward network that is applied to each position in the sequence independently. The sublayer takes the output of the layer normalization sublayer as input and applies two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\n* Residual connection: This sublayer adds the input of the sublayer to the output of the sublayer. This is done to help with training and to allow the model to learn to ignore irrelevant information.\n\nThe sublayers in the transformer architecture are arranged in a specific order, and each transformer layer consists of a sequence of these sublayers. The multi-headed self-attention sublayer is used to attend to the input sequence and learn contextual representations of the input tokens. The layer normalization sublayer is used to stabilize the training process and improve convergence. The position-wise feed-forward network sublayer is used to learn non-linear transformations of the input sequence. The residual connection sublayer is used to help with training and to allow the model to learn to ignore irrelevant information.\n\n Pseudocode\n\nThe following is pseudocode for the pre-LN encoder-decoder Transformer architecture:\n\n    function Transformer(x, src_mask, tgt_mask, src_pad_mask, model):\n        x = Embedding(x, d_model)\n        x = LayerNorm(x + Embedding)\n        for i = 1 to N:\n            x = LayerNorm(x + MultiHeadSelfAttention(x, x, x, src_mask, src_pad_mask))\n            x = LayerNorm(x + EncoderLayer(x, x, src_mask, src_pad_mask))\n        \n        x = LayerNorm(x + Embedding)\n        x = Embedding(x, d_model)\n        x = LayerNorm(x + Embedding)\n        for i = 1 to N:\n            x = LayerNorm(x + MultiHeadSelfAttention(x, x, x, tgt_mask))\n            x = LayerNorm(x + EncoderLayer(x, x, tgt_mask))\n        \n        x = LayerNorm(x + Embedding)\n        x = Embedding(x, d_model)\n        x = LayerNorm(x + Embedding)\n        for i = 1 to N:\n            x = LayerNorm(x + MultiHeadSelfAttention(x, x, x, None))\n            x = LayerNorm(x + EncoderLayer(x, x))\n        \n        return Linear(x)\n\n Terminology\n\nTransformer architecture is a neural network architecture that is widely used in natural language processing (NLP) and other fields. There are several variations of the architecture, each with its own specific terminology and notation. Here are some common terms used in the literature on Transformer architecture:\n\n* Encoder: A module that takes a sequence of input tokens and produces a sequence of hidden states that capture the contextual information of the input sequence.\n* Decoder: A module that takes a sequence of input tokens and a sequence of hidden states produced by the encoder, and produces a sequence of output tokens.\n* Attention mechanism: A mechanism that allows the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence when generating each output token.\n* Multi-headed attention: An extension of the attention mechanism that allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions.\n* Feed-forward network: A neural network that is applied to each position in the sequence independently, and is used to learn non-linear transformations of the input sequence.\n* Layer normalization: A technique that is used to stabilize the training process and improve convergence by normalizing the output of each layer.\n* Positional encoding: A technique that is used to provide information about the position of each token in the sequence to the model.\n* Self-attention: An attention mechanism that is used to attend to different parts of the input sequence when generating each output token.\n* Cross-attention: An attention mechanism that is used to attend to the hidden states produced by the encoder when generating each output token.\n* Causal attention: An attention mechanism that is used to ensure that the model only attends to past tokens during decoding, and does not attend to future tokens.\n* Embedding layer: A layer that maps each input token to a dense vector representation.\n* Linear layer: A layer that performs a linear transformation of the input sequence.\n* Softmax layer: A layer that computes the probabilities of the output tokens.\n* Vocabulary: The set of all possible tokens that can appear in the input or output sequences.\n* D_model: The dimensionality of the input and output vectors.\n* N: The number of transformer layers in the model.\n\n Subsequent work\n\nSince the introduction of the Transformer architecture, there have been several subsequent works that have proposed variations and extensions to the original model. Some notable examples include:\n\n* Transformer-XL: Transformer-XL\u00a0<cit.> extends the Transformer architecture to handle longer-range dependencies by introducing segment embedding and relative positional encoding.\n* BERT: BERT\u00a0<cit.> is a bidirectional Transformer model pre-trained using a combination of masked language modeling and next sentence prediction objectives.\n* GPT-2: GPT-2\u00a0<cit.> is a Transformer language model trained using a denoising objective on a large corpus of internet text.\n* T5: T5\u00a0<cit.> is a Transformer model trained on a variety of text-to-text tasks, such as summarization and question answering.\n* XLNET: XLNET\u00a0<cit.> is a Transformer model that uses a permutation-based strategy to model bidirectional context.\n\n Alternative activation functions\n\nIn the original Transformer architecture, the feed-forward layers use the GELU activation function. However, other activation functions such as SwiGLU and GELU have been proposed as alternatives.\n\nSwiGLU is a gated linear unit that uses a sigmoid activation function to control the flow of information through the network. It is defined as:\n\n    x * \u03c3(x)\n\nwhere x is the input to the activation function and \u03c3 is the sigmoid function.\n\nGELU is a smooth, non-monotonic activation function that is defined as:\n\n    x * \u03a6(x)\n\nwhere x is the input to the activation function and \u03a6 is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution.\n\nThese activation functions have been found to improve the performance of the Transformer architecture in certain tasks.\n\n Alternative normalizations\n\nIn the original Transformer architecture, the authors used layer normalization. However, other normalization techniques such as RMSNorm, CapsuleNorm, ScaleNorm, and FixNorm have been proposed as alternatives.\n\nRMSNorm is a normalization technique that divides the input by the root mean square of its elements. It is defined as:\n\n    x / \u221a(E[x^2] + \u03f5)\n\nwhere x is the input to the normalization function, E is the expectation operator, \u03f5 is a small constant to avoid division by zero, and \u221a denotes the square root function.\n\nCapsuleNorm is a normalization technique that is based on capsule networks. It is defined as:\n\n    x / \u2016x\u2016_\u221e\n\nwhere x is the input to the normalization function and \u2016\u00b7\u2016_\u221e denotes the L-infinity norm.\n\nScaleNorm is a normalization technique that scales the input by a learnable parameter. It is defined as:\n\n    \u03b1 x\n\nwhere x is the input to the normalization function and \u03b1 is a learnable scalar parameter.\n\nFixNorm is a normalization technique that fixes the normalization constant to a predefined value. It is defined as:\n\n    x / c\n\nwhere x is the input to the normalization function and c is a fixed normalization constant.\n\nThese normalization techniques have been found to improve the performance of the Transformer architecture in certain tasks.\n\n Alternative positional encodings\n\nIn the original Transformer architecture, the authors used a fixed sinusoidal positional encoding. However, other positional encoding techniques such as learned positional encoding and relative positional encoding have been proposed as alternatives.\n\nLearned positional encoding is a technique that uses a learnable embedding matrix to encode the position of each token in the sequence. The positional embeddings are added to the input embeddings before passing them through the Transformer layers.\n\nRelative positional encoding is a technique that uses relative positions instead of absolute positions to encode the position of each token in the sequence. The relative positions are encoded using a set of learnable embeddings, and the embeddings are added to the input embeddings before passing them through the Transformer layers.\n\nThese positional encoding techniques have been found to improve the performance of the Transformer architecture in certain tasks.\n\n RoPE\n\nRotary Positional Encoding (RoPE) is a technique used in transformer models to encode the position of tokens in a sequence. Unlike traditional positional encoding methods that rely on learnable parameters or fixed sinusoidal functions, RoPE uses rotary embeddings to encode position information directly into the model's hidden states.\n\nIn RoPE, each token's representation is rotated by an angle that depends on its position in the sequence. This rotation is performed using a set of learnable rotary embeddings, which are applied to the hidden states of the model. The rotation matrix for each token is constructed using the cosine and sine values of the rotary embeddings, which are applied to alternate dimensions of the hidden states.\n\nThe use of RoPE has been shown to improve the performance of transformer models on a variety of tasks, especially those involving long-context reasoning. This is because RoPE provides a more flexible and dynamic way of encoding position information, which allows the model to better capture the relative positions of tokens in a sequence.\n\nALiBi (Attention with Linear Biases) is a technique used in transformer models to improve the efficiency and performance of the attention mechanism. The technique was introduced in the paper \"Dynamic Attention Biasing for Long Context Processing\" by Devlin et al. (2023).\n\nThe attention mechanism in transformer models is used to weigh the importance of different tokens in a sequence when generating each output token. However, as the length of the input sequence increases, the computational cost of the attention mechanism also increases, which can slow down training and inference.\n\nALiBi addresses this issue by assigning a linearly decreasing attention bias to each position in the sequence. The bias starts at a high value for the current token and decreases linearly for each previous token in the sequence. This means that the current token is given a high weight, while the importance of previous tokens decreases as they become less relevant to the current token.\n\nThe attention mechanism then computes the attention scores for each token in the sequence, taking into account the attention biases. The attention scores are then normalized using the softmax function, and the resulting weights are used to compute a weighted sum of the tokens in the sequence.\n\nThe use of ALiBi has been shown to improve the efficiency and performance of the attention mechanism, especially for long input sequences. This is because the linearly decreasing biases allow the model to focus on the most relevant tokens in the sequence, without having to compute attention scores for all tokens.\n\nRelative Position Encodings\n\nRelative position encodings are a technique used in transformer models to encode the relative position between tokens in a sequence. Unlike traditional positional encodings that encode the absolute position of each token, relative position encodings encode the distance between tokens in the sequence.\n\nIn transformer models, the attention mechanism is used to weigh the importance of different tokens in a sequence when generating each output token. However, the attention mechanism assumes that the input sequence is ordered, which can limit its ability to handle sequences with irregular or dynamic ordering.\n\nRelative position encodings address this issue by encoding the relative position between tokens in the sequence. This allows the model to attend to tokens that are far apart in the sequence, as long as they are at a similar relative position.\n\nOne common approach to implementing relative position encodings in transformer models is to add learnable embeddings to the hidden states of the model. These embeddings encode the relative position between tokens in the sequence, and are added to the hidden states before the attention mechanism is applied.\n\nThe use of relative position encodings has been shown to improve the performance of transformer models on a variety of tasks, especially those involving long-context reasoning or sequences with irregular ordering.\n\n Efficient implementation\n\nThe Transformer architecture has been widely adopted in industry and academia due to its superior performance on a range of tasks, including language modeling, translation, and question answering. However, the architecture can be computationally expensive, particularly for long sequences. To address this challenge, several groups have developed optimized implementations of the Transformer, including OpenAI's Triton\u00a0<cit.>, Facebook AI\u2019s Flash Attention\u00a0<cit.>, and Google Brain\u2019s xformers\u00a0<cit.>.\n\nThese implementations leverage hardware acceleration, such as GPUs and TPUs, to speed up the computation of the attention mechanism, which is a key component of the Transformer. They also employ techniques such as kernel fusion, parallelization, and memory optimization to reduce memory usage and improve computational efficiency.\n\nEfficient implementations of the Transformer have enabled the training and deployment of larger and more complex models, such as GPT-3 and BERT, which have achieved state-of-the-art performance on a range of tasks. As the demand for more powerful and scalable models continues to grow, efficient implementation of the Transformer will remain an important area of research and development.\n\n KV caching\n\nKV caching is a technique used in autoregressive transformers to improve inference efficiency, particularly when dealing with long contexts. In autoregressive models, each token is generated conditioned on all previous tokens, which requires storing and attending to the entire history of tokens seen so far. This can be computationally expensive and memory-intensive, especially for long sequences.\n\nKV caching addresses this issue by storing only the key-value pairs of the attention mechanism for the tokens that have already been generated, rather than storing the full token embeddings. During inference, the key-value pairs are accumulated as new tokens are generated, allowing the model to attend to a longer context without requiring additional memory for the token embeddings themselves.\n\nThere are several variants of KV caching, including full KV caching, which stores the full history of key-value pairs, and truncated KV caching, which only stores a subset of the most recent tokens. Truncated KV caching can further optimize memory usage by selectively discarding less important key-value pairs based on heuristics such as recency or importance scores.\n\nKV caching can be particularly useful in applications such as chatbots or conversational agents, where the model needs to maintain context across multiple turns of dialogue. By allowing the model to attend to a longer context without incurring a computational or memory burden, KV caching can improve the performance and usability of these systems.\n\n FlashAttention\n\nFlashAttention is a library that implements the FlashAttention algorithm, a highly efficient and memory-friendly implementation of the attention mechanism used in transformer models. The FlashAttention algorithm achieves high performance by using a combination of techniques, including parallelization, memory-efficient key-value caching, and kernel fusion.\n\nThe FlashAttention algorithm works by first loading a block of keys, values, and queries into a contiguous chunk of memory called a \"flash buffer\". The attention computation is then performed in a single kernel launch, using parallelization across multiple GPU blocks. After the computation is complete, the resulting attention weights are used to compute the output of the attention layer.\n\nOne key feature of the FlashAttention algorithm is its use of key-value caching, which allows the attention computation to be performed on a subset of the key-value pairs that are currently in memory, rather than on the entire history of key-value pairs. This is achieved by using a technique called \"strided slicing\", which allows the key-value pairs to be efficiently loaded into the flash buffer without requiring additional memory allocations.\n\nAnother important aspect of the FlashAttention algorithm is its use of kernel fusion, which combines multiple kernel launches into a single kernel launch. This reduces the overhead of kernel launches and improves the overall efficiency of the attention computation.\n\nOverall, the FlashAttention algorithm has become a popular choice for transformer model training and inference, thanks to its high performance and memory efficiency. The FlashAttention library provides a simple interface for integrating the FlashAttention algorithm into existing transformer models, making it easy to take advantage of its performance benefits.\n\n Multi-Query Attention\n\nMulti-Query Attention (MQA) is a modification to the standard multi-headed attention mechanism in the Transformer architecture. In the standard multi-headed attention mechanism, each attention head has its own set of query, key, and value matrices, which means that the number of attention heads directly impacts the computational cost of the attention mechanism. MQA reduces the computational cost of the attention mechanism by sharing the same query matrix across all attention heads.\n\nInstead of having a separate set of query, key, and value matrices for each attention head, MQA uses a single set of query matrices for all heads. The key and value matrices are still unique to each head, but the query matrices are shared. This reduces the number of parameters needed for the attention mechanism and can lead to faster training times and reduced memory usage.\n\nMQA has been shown to perform similarly to the standard multi-headed attention mechanism on a range of natural language processing tasks, while requiring fewer computational resources. This makes it a popular choice for applications where computational efficiency is important.\n\nGrouped-query attention is a variation of Multi-Query Attention (MQA) that further reduces the computational cost of the attention mechanism by grouping multiple queries into a single query vector. In MQA, a single query vector is used for all attention heads, but the key and value matrices are still unique to each head. In Grouped-query attention, multiple query vectors are used, each of which is associated with a subset of the attention heads.\n\nThe use of multiple query vectors allows for more fine-grained control over the attention mechanism, as each query vector can be optimized for a specific set of attention heads. This can lead to improved performance on certain tasks, as the attention mechanism can be tailored to the specific requirements of the task.\n\nGrouped-query attention has been shown to be effective on a range of natural language processing tasks, including machine translation and text classification. By reducing the computational cost of the attention mechanism while improving performance, grouped-query attention offers a promising approach for building more efficient and effective transformer models.\n\n Speculative decoding\n\nSpeculative decoding is a technique used in transformer models to accelerate token decoding by using a smaller model or heuristic to generate a set of candidate tokens for the next step, which are then verified by a larger model. This approach allows for faster decoding while maintaining high accuracy, as the larger model is used to filter out low-quality tokens generated by the smaller model.\n\nIn speculative decoding, the smaller model is typically a distilled version of the larger model, trained to capture the most important aspects of the larger model's behavior. The smaller model is used to generate a set of candidate tokens for the next step, which are then fed into the larger model to verify their quality. If a candidate token is deemed high-quality by the larger model, it is added to the list of tokens to be decoded; otherwise, it is discarded.\n\nSpeculative decoding can be used in both greedy and non-greedy decoding modes. In greedy decoding mode, the first token generated by the smaller model is decoded using the larger model, and the process is repeated for subsequent tokens. In non-greedy decoding mode, multiple candidate tokens are generated by the smaller model, and the largest subset of these tokens that can be decoded by the larger model without conflict is chosen for decoding.\n\nSpeculative decoding has been shown to be effective for accelerating token decoding in transformer models, particularly for tasks such as language modeling and machine translation. By using a smaller model to generate candidate tokens and a larger model to verify their quality, speculative decoding can significantly reduce the decoding time while maintaining high accuracy.\n\n Sub-quadratic transformers\n\nSub-quadratic Transformers are a class of transformer models that have been designed to handle long sequences more efficiently than traditional quadratic-time transformer models. In a traditional transformer model, the complexity of the attention mechanism is O(n^2), where n is the sequence length, which can become prohibitively expensive for long sequences.\n\nSub-quadratic transformers use a variety of techniques to reduce the complexity of the attention mechanism. One common approach is to use locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) to group nearby tokens together and only compute attention within each group. This reduces the number of pairs of tokens that need to be attended to, resulting in a sub-quadratic complexity.\n\nOther approaches include using hierarchical attention, where the input sequence is recursively divided into smaller chunks and attention is only computed within each chunk, or using fixed-rank attention, where only a subset of the input tokens are attended to at each position.\n\nSub-quadratic transformers have been shown to be effective for tasks such as language modeling and machine translation on long sequences. By reducing the computational complexity of the attention mechanism, these models can handle much longer sequences than traditional quadratic-time transformers, making them useful for a variety of applications.\n\n Alternative attention graphs\n\nIn the original Transformer architecture, the attention mechanism is computed using a bipartite graph between the query and key vectors. However, there have been several proposals for alternative attention graphs that can reduce the computational complexity of the attention mechanism.\n\nOne such proposal is the Reformer, which uses a locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) to group nearby keys together and compute attention only within each group. This reduces the computational complexity from O(n^2) to O(n log n) or O(n).\n\nAnother proposal is the Longformer, which uses a fixed context window attention mechanism that attends to a fixed number of tokens on both sides of each position. This allows the model to attend to both local and global context, while keeping the computational complexity manageable.\n\nFinally, the BigBird proposal uses a sparsely connected bipartite graph that connects each query to a fixed number of keys in a non-contiguous manner. This allows the model to attend to both local and global context, while keeping the computational complexity manageable.\n\nThese alternative attention graphs have been shown to be effective for tasks such as language modeling and machine translation, and can handle much longer sequences than the original Transformer architecture.\n\n Random Feature Attention\n\nRandom Feature Attention (RFA) is a technique used in transformer models to approximate the attention mechanism using random features. The RFA mechanism works by projecting the query, key, and value vectors into a high-dimensional feature space using a random linear transformation, and then computing the attention scores in this feature space.\n\nThe attention scores are then normalized using the softmax function, and the resulting weights are used to compute a weighted sum of the value vectors. The use of random features allows the RFA mechanism to approximate the attention mechanism with a linear complexity in the sequence length, making it more computationally efficient than the standard attention mechanism.\n\nThe RFA mechanism has been shown to achieve competitive performance with the standard attention mechanism on a range of natural language processing tasks, while being significantly more computationally efficient. This makes it a promising alternative to the standard attention mechanism, particularly for applications with limited computational resources.\n\n Multimodality\n\nIn addition to its use in natural language processing, the Transformer architecture has also been extended to handle multiple modalities of data, such as images, speech, and video. These multimodal Transformers incorporate information from multiple sources to improve performance on tasks such as image captioning, speech recognition, and video captioning.\n\nOne approach to building a multimodal Transformer is to use a shared embedding space for all modalities, where the embeddings for each modality are learned jointly. This allows the model to learn a common representation that captures the relationships between different modalities.\n\nAnother approach is to use separate embedding spaces for each modality, and then combine the embeddings using a fusion mechanism such as attention or convolution. This allows the model to learn separate representations for each modality, while still capturing the relationships between them.\n\nMultimodal Transformers have been shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a range of multimodal tasks, and have the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with machines by enabling them to understand and reason about multiple forms of information simultaneously.\n\n Applications\n\nThe Transformer architecture has been successfully applied to a wide range of tasks in natural language processing (NLP) and other fields. Some examples of applications of the Transformer architecture include:\n\n* Language modeling: The Transformer architecture has been used to develop state-of-the-art language models such as BERT, GPT, and T5, which have achieved significant improvements over traditional models on a variety of NLP tasks.\n* Machine translation: The Transformer architecture has been used to develop state-of-the-art machine translation systems such as Google's Neural Machine Translation system, which has achieved significant improvements over traditional models on a variety of language pairs.\n* Text classification: The Transformer architecture has been used to develop state-of-the-art text classification systems for tasks such as sentiment analysis, spam detection, and topic classification.\n* Question answering: The Transformer architecture has been used to develop state-of-the-art question answering systems such as BERT-QA, which have achieved significant improvements over traditional models on tasks such as the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD).\n* Conversational agents: The Transformer architecture has been used to develop state-of-the-art conversational agents such as Dialogflow and IBM Watson, which have achieved significant improvements over traditional models on tasks such as dialogue state tracking and intent recognition.\n\nSee also\n\n* List of machine learning algorithms\n* List of natural language processing algorithms\n* List of neural network models\n\nNotes\n\n* \u2191 Vaswani et\u00a0al.
