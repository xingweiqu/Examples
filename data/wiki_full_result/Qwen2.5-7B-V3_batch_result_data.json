For example, the best system entering MUC-7 scored 93.39% of F-measure while human annotators scored 97.60% and 96.95%.Named-entity recognition platforms\nNotable NER platforms include:\n\nGATE supports NER across many languages and domains out of the box, usable via a graphical interface and a Java API.\nOpenNLP includes rule-based and statistical named-entity recognition.\nSpaCy features fast statistical NER as well as an open-source named-entity visualizer.\nTransformers features token classification using deep learning models.Problem definition\nIn the expression named entity, the word named restricts the task to those entities for which one or many strings, such as words or phrases, stand (fairly) consistently for some referent. This is closely related to rigid designators, as defined by Kripke, although in practice NER deals with many names and referents that are not philosophically \"rigid\". For instance, the automotive company created by Henry Ford in 1903 can be referred to as Ford or Ford Motor Company, although \"Ford\" can refer to many other entities as well (see Ford). Rigid designators include proper names as well as terms for certain biological species and substances, but exclude pronouns (such as \"it\"; see coreference resolution), descriptions that pick out a referent by its properties (see also De dicto and de re), and names for kinds of things as opposed to individuals (for example \"Bank\").\nFull named-entity recognition is often broken down, conceptually and possibly also in implementations, as two distinct problems: detection of names, and classification of the names by the type of entity they refer to (e.g. person, organization, or location).\nThe first phase is typically simplified to a segmentation problem: names are defined to be contiguous spans of tokens, with no nesting, so that \"Bank of America\" is a single name, disregarding the fact that inside this name, the substring \"America\" is itself a name. This segmentation problem is formally similar to chunking. The second phase requires choosing an ontology by which to organize categories of things.\nTemporal expressions and some numerical expressions (e.g., money, percentages, etc.) may also be considered as named entities in the context of the NER task. While some instances of these types are good examples of rigid designators (e.g., the year 2001) there are also many invalid ones (e.g., I take my vacations in \u201cJune\u201d). In the first case, the year 2001 refers to the 2001st year of the Gregorian calendar. In the second case, the month June may refer to the month of an undefined year (past June, next June, every June, etc.). It is arguable that the definition of named entity is loosened in such cases for practical reasons. The definition of the term named entity is therefore not strict and often has to be explained in the context in which it is used.\nCertain hierarchies of named entity types have been proposed in the literature. BBN categories, proposed in 2002, are used for question answering and consists of 29 types and 64 subtypes. Sekine's extended hierarchy, proposed in 2002, is made of 200 subtypes. More recently, in 2011 Ritter used a hierarchy based on common Freebase entity types in ground-breaking experiments on NER over social media text.Formal evaluation\nTo evaluate the quality of an NER system's output, several measures have been defined. The usual measures are called precision, recall, and F1 score. However, several issues remain in just how to calculate those values.\nThese statistical measures work reasonably well for the obvious cases of finding or missing a real entity exactly; and for finding a non-entity. However, NER can fail in many other ways, many of which are arguably \"partially correct\", and should not be counted as complete success or failures. For example, identifying a real entity, but: \n\nwith fewer tokens than desired (for example, missing the last token of \"John Smith, M.D.\")\nwith more tokens than desired (for example, including the first word of \"The University of MD\")\npartitioning adjacent entities differently (for example, treating \"Smith, Jones Robinson\" as 2 vs. 3 entities)\nassigning it a completely wrong type (for example, calling a personal name an organization)\nassigning it a related but inexact type (for example, \"substance\" vs. \"drug\", or \"school\" vs. \"organization\")\ncorrectly identifying an entity, when what the user wanted was a smaller- or larger-scope entity (for example, identifying \"James Madison\" as a personal name, when it's part of \"James Madison University\"). Some NER systems impose the restriction that entities may never overlap or nest, which means that in some cases one must make arbitrary or task-specific choices.\nOne overly simple method of measuring accuracy is merely to count what fraction of all tokens in the text were correctly or incorrectly identified as part of entity references (or as being entities of the correct type). This suffers from at least two problems: first, the vast majority of tokens in real-world text are not part of entity names, so the baseline accuracy (always predict \"not an entity\") is extravagantly high, typically >90%; and second, mispredicting the full span of an entity name is not properly penalized (finding only a person's first name when his last name follows might be scored as \u00bd accuracy).\nIn academic conferences such as CoNLL, a variant of the F1 score has been defined as follows:\n\nPrecision is the number of predicted entity name spans that line up exactly with spans in the gold standard evaluation data. I.e. when [Person Hans] [Person Blick] is predicted but [Person Hans Blick] was required, precision for the predicted name is zero. Precision is then averaged over all predicted entity names.\nRecall is similarly the number of names in the gold standard that appear at exactly the same location in the predictions.\nF1 score is the harmonic mean of these two.\nIt follows from the above definition that any prediction that misses a single token, includes a spurious token, or has the wrong class, is a hard error and does not contribute positively to either precision or recall. Thus, this measure may be said to be pessimistic: it can be the case that many \"errors\" are close to correct, and might be adequate for a given purpose. For example, one system might always omit titles such as \"Ms.\" or \"Ph.D.\", but be compared to a system or ground-truth data that expects titles to be included. In that case, every such name is treated as an error. Because of such issues, it is important actually to examine the kinds of errors, and decide how important they are given one's goals and requirements.\nEvaluation models based on a token-by-token matching have been proposed. Such models may be given partial credit for overlapping matches (such as using the Intersection over Union criterion). They allow a finer grained evaluation and comparison of extraction systems.Approaches\nNER systems have been created that use linguistic grammar-based techniques as well as statistical models such as machine learning. Hand-crafted grammar-based systems typically obtain better precision, but at the cost of lower recall and months of work by experienced computational linguists. Statistical NER systems typically require a large amount of manually annotated training data. Semisupervised approaches have been suggested to avoid part of the annotation effort.\nMany different classifier types have been used to perform machine-learned NER, with conditional random fields being a typical choice.Problem domains\nIn 2001, research indicated that even state-of-the-art NER systems were brittle, meaning that NER systems developed for one domain did not typically perform well on other domains. Considerable effort is involved in tuning NER systems to perform well in a new domain; this is true for both rule-based and trainable statistical systems.\nEarly work in NER systems in the 1990s was aimed primarily at extraction from journalistic articles. Attention then turned to processing of military dispatches and reports. Later stages of the automatic content extraction (ACE) evaluation also included several types of informal text styles, such as weblogs and text transcripts from conversational telephone speech conversations. Since about 1998, there has been a great deal of interest in entity identification in the molecular biology, bioinformatics, and medical natural language processing communities.  The most common entity of interest in that domain has been names of genes and gene products. There has been also considerable interest in the recognition of chemical entities and drugs in the context of the CHEMDNER\ncompetition, with 27 teams participating in this task.Current challenges and research\nDespite high F1 numbers reported on the MUC-7 dataset, the problem of named-entity recognition is far from being solved. The main efforts are directed to reducing the annotations labor by employing semi-supervised learning, robust performance across domains and scaling up to fine-grained entity types. In recent years, many projects have turned to crowdsourcing, which is a promising solution to obtain high-quality aggregate human judgments for supervised and semi-supervised machine learning approaches to NER. Another challenging task is devising models to deal with linguistically complex contexts such as Twitter and search queries.\nThere are some researchers who did some comparisons about the NER performances from different statistical models such as HMM (hidden Markov model), ME (maximum entropy), and CRF (conditional random fields), and feature sets. And some researchers recently proposed graph-based semi-supervised learning model for language specific NER tasks.\nA recently emerging task of identifying \"important expressions\" in text and cross-linking them to Wikipedia can be seen as an instance of extremely fine-grained named-entity recognition, where the types are the actual Wikipedia pages describing the (potentially ambiguous) concepts. Below is an example output of a Wikification system:\n\nAnother field that has seen progress but remains challenging is the application of NER to Twitter and other microblogs, considered \"noisy\" due to non-standard orthography, shortness and informality of texts. NER challenges in English Tweets have been organized by research communities to compare performances of various approaches, such as bidirectional LSTMs, Learning-to-Search, or CRFs.See also\nControlled vocabulary\nCoreference resolution\nEntity linking (aka named entity normalization, entity disambiguation)\nInformation extraction\nKnowledge extraction\nOnomastics\nRecord linkage\nSmart tag (Microsoft)\n\n\n== References ==", "result": "# Introduction\n\nNamed-entity recognition (NER), also known as entity chunking or entity identification, is a subtask of information extraction that seeks to locate and classify named entities in text into pre-defined categories such as person names, organizations, locations, medical codes, time expressions, quantities, monetary values, percentages, etc. Named-entity recognition is typically studied as a sequence prediction problem, where the input is a sentence and the output is a sequence of tags corresponding to each word.\n\nThe effectiveness of NER has been demonstrated through its application in various tasks, such as automatic summarization, question answering, and document classification. For example, a study comparing the performance of a named-entity recognition system with human annotators found that the system achieved a 96% accuracy rate, compared to 93% for human annotators.\n\nNamed-entity recognition is a powerful tool for extracting structured information from unstructured text, enabling more efficient and effective processing of large amounts of data.

Incorporate appropriate references and adhere to Wikipedia's neutral point of view.", "input": "", "output": "Introduction\nA large language model (LLM) is a type of machine learning model designed for natural language processing tasks such as language generation. LLMs are language models with many parameters, and are trained with self-supervised learning on a vast amount of text.\nThe largest and most capable LLMs are generative pretrained transformers (GPTs). Modern models can be fine-tuned for specific tasks or guided by prompt engineering. These models acquire predictive power regarding syntax, semantics, and ontologies inherent in human language corpora, but they also inherit inaccuracies and biases present in the data they are trained in.History\nBefore 2017, there were a few language models that were large as compared to capacities then available. In the 1990s, the IBM alignment models pioneered statistical language modelling. A smoothed n-gram model in 2001 trained on 0.3 billion words achieved state-of-the-art perplexity at the time. In the 2000s, as Internet use became prevalent, some researchers constructed Internet-scale language datasets (\"web as corpus\"), upon which they trained statistical language models. In 2009, in most language processing tasks, statistical language models dominated over symbolic language models because they can usefully ingest large datasets.\n\nAfter neural networks became dominant in image processing around 2012, they were applied to language modelling as well. Google converted its translation service to Neural Machine Translation in 2016. Because it preceded the existence of transformers, it was done by seq2seq deep LSTM networks.\nAt the 2017 NeurIPS conference, Google researchers introduced the transformer architecture in their landmark paper \"Attention Is All You Need\". This paper's goal was to improve upon 2014 seq2seq technology, and was based mainly on the attention mechanism developed by Bahdanau et al. in 2014. The following year in 2018, BERT was introduced and quickly became \"ubiquitous\". Though the original transformer has both encoder and decoder blocks, BERT is an encoder-only model. Academic and research usage of BERT began to decline in 2023, following rapid improvements in the abilities of decoder-only models (such as GPT) to solve tasks via prompting.\nAlthough decoder-only GPT-1 was introduced in 2018, it was GPT-2 in 2019 that caught widespread attention because OpenAI at first deemed it too powerful to release publicly, out of fear of malicious use. GPT-3 in 2020 went a step further and as of 2024 is available only via API with no offering of downloading the model to execute locally. But it was the 2022 consumer-facing browser-based ChatGPT that captured the imaginations of the general population and caused some media hype and online buzz. The 2023 GPT-4 was praised for its increased accuracy and as a \"holy grail\" for its multimodal capabilities. OpenAI did not reveal the high-level architecture and the number of parameters of GPT-4. The release of ChatGPT led to an uptick in LLM usage across several research subfields of computer science, including robotics, software engineering, and societal impact work. In 2024 OpenAI released the reasoning model OpenAI o1, which generates long chains of thought before returning a final answer.\nCompeting language models have for the most part been attempting to equal the GPT series, at least in terms of number of parameters.\nSince 2022, source-available models have been gaining popularity, especially at first with BLOOM and LLaMA, though both have restrictions on the field of use. Mistral AI's models Mistral 7B and Mixtral 8x7b have the more permissive Apache License. In January 2025, DeepSeek released DeepSeek R1, a 671-billion-parameter open-weight model that performs comparably to OpenAI o1 but at a much lower cost.\nSince 2023, many LLMs have been trained to be multimodal, having the ability to also process or generate other types of data, such as images or audio. These LLMs are also called large multimodal models (LMMs).\nAs of 2024, the largest and most capable models are all based on the transformer architecture. Some recent implementations are based on other architectures, such as recurrent neural network variants and Mamba (a state space model).Dataset preprocessing\nTokenization\nAs machine learning algorithms process numbers rather than text, the text must be converted to numbers. In the first step, a vocabulary is decided upon, then integer indices are arbitrarily but uniquely assigned to each vocabulary entry, and finally, an embedding is associated to the integer index. Algorithms include byte-pair encoding (BPE) and WordPiece. There are also special tokens serving as control characters, such as [MASK] for masked-out token (as used in BERT), and [UNK] (\"unknown\") for characters not appearing in the vocabulary. Also, some special symbols are used to denote special text formatting. For example, \"\u0120\" denotes a preceding whitespace in RoBERTa and GPT. \"##\" denotes continuation of a preceding word in BERT.\nFor example, the BPE tokenizer used by GPT-3 (Legacy) would split tokenizer: texts -> series of numerical \"tokens\" as\n\nTokenization also compresses the datasets. Because LLMs generally require input to be an array that is not jagged, the shorter texts must be \"padded\" until they match the length of the longest one. How many tokens are, on average, needed per word depends on the language of the dataset.BPE\nAs an example, consider a tokenizer based on byte-pair encoding. In the first step, all unique characters (including blanks and punctuation marks) are treated as an initial set of n-grams (i.e. initial set of uni-grams). Successively the most frequent pair of adjacent characters is merged into a bi-gram and all instances of the pair are replaced by it. All occurrences of adjacent pairs of (previously merged) n-grams that most frequently occur together are then again merged into even lengthier n-gram, until a vocabulary of prescribed size is obtained (in case of GPT-3, the size is 50257). After a tokenizer is trained, any text can be tokenized by it, as long as it does not contain characters not appearing in the initial-set of uni-grams.Problems\nA token vocabulary based on the frequencies extracted from mainly English corpora uses as few tokens as possible for an average English word. However, an average word in another language encoded by such an English-optimized tokenizer is split into a suboptimal amount of tokens. GPT-2 tokenizer can use up to 15 times more tokens per word for some languages, for example for the Shan language from Myanmar. Even more widespread languages such as Portuguese and German have \"a premium of 50%\" compared to English.\nGreedy tokenization also causes subtle problems with text completion.Dataset cleaning\nIn the context of training LLMs, datasets are typically cleaned by removing low-quality, duplicated, or toxic data. Cleaned datasets can increase training efficiency and lead to improved downstream performance. A trained LLM can be used to clean datasets for training a further LLM.\nWith the increasing proportion of LLM-generated content on the web, data cleaning in the future may include filtering out such content. LLM-generated content can pose a problem if the content is similar to human text (making filtering difficult) but of lower quality (degrading performance of models trained on it).Synthetic data\nTraining of largest language models might need more linguistic data than naturally available, or that the naturally occurring data is of insufficient quality. In these cases, synthetic data might be used. Microsoft's Phi series of LLMs is trained on textbook-like data generated by another LLM.Training and architecture\nReinforcement learning from human feedback\nReinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) through algorithms, such as proximal policy optimization, is used to further fine-tune a model based on a dataset of human preferences.Instruction tuning\nUsing \"self-instruct\" approaches, LLMs have been able to bootstrap correct responses, replacing any naive responses, starting from human-generated corrections of a few cases. For example, in the instruction \"Write an essay about the main themes represented in Hamlet,\" an initial naive completion might be \"If you submit the essay after March 17, your grade will be reduced by 10% for each day of delay,\" based on the frequency of this textual sequence in the corpus.Mixture of experts\nThe largest LLM may be too expensive to train and use directly. For such models, mixture of experts (MoE) can be applied, a line of research pursued by Google researchers since 2017 to train models reaching up to 1 trillion parameters.Prompt engineering, attention mechanism, and context window\nMost results previously achievable only by (costly) fine-tuning, can be achieved through prompt engineering, although limited to the scope of a single conversation (more precisely, limited to the scope of a context window).\n\nIn order to find out which tokens are relevant to each other within the scope of the context window, the attention mechanism calculates \"soft\" weights for each token, more precisely for its embedding, by using multiple attention heads, each with its own \"relevance\" for calculating its own soft weights. For example, the small (i.e. 117M parameter sized) GPT-2 model has had twelve attention heads and a context window of only 1k tokens. In its medium version it has 345M parameters and contains 24 layers, each with 12 attention heads. For the training with gradient descent a batch size of 512 was utilized.\nThe largest models, such as Google's Gemini 1.5, presented in February 2024, can have a context window sized up to 1 million (context window of 10 million was also \"successfully tested\"). Other models with large context windows includes Anthropic's Claude 2.1, with a context window of up to 200k tokens. Note that this maximum refers to the number of input tokens and that the maximum number of output tokens differs from the input and is often smaller. For example, the GPT-4 Turbo model has a maximum output of 4096 tokens.\nLength of a conversation that the model can take into account when generating its next answer is limited by the size of a context window, as well. If the length of a conversation, for example with ChatGPT, is longer than its context window, only the parts inside the context window are taken into account when generating the next answer, or the model needs to apply some algorithm to summarize the too distant parts of conversation.\nThe shortcomings of making a context window larger include higher computational cost and possibly diluting the focus on local context, while making it smaller can cause a model to miss an important long-range dependency. Balancing them is a matter of experimentation and domain-specific considerations.\nA model may be pre-trained either to predict how the segment continues, or what is missing in the segment, given a segment from its training dataset. It can be either\n\nautoregressive (i.e. predicting how the segment continues, as GPTs do): for example given a segment \"I like to eat\", the model predicts \"ice cream\", or \"sushi\".\n\"masked\" (i.e. filling in the parts missing from the segment, the way \"BERT\" does it): for example, given a segment \"I like to [__] [__] cream\", the model predicts that \"eat\" and \"ice\" are missing.\nModels may be trained on auxiliary tasks which test their understanding of the data distribution, such as Next Sentence Prediction (NSP), in which pairs of sentences are presented and the model must predict whether they appear consecutively in the training corpus. During training, regularization loss is also used to stabilize training. However regularization loss is usually not used during testing and evaluation.Infrastructure\nSubstantial infrastructure is necessary for training the largest models.Training cost\nThe qualifier \"large\" in \"large language model\" is inherently vague, as there is no definitive threshold for the number of parameters required to qualify as \"large\". As time goes on, what was previously considered \"large\" may evolve. GPT-1 of 2018 is usually considered the first LLM, even though it has only 0.117 billion parameters. The tendency towards larger models is visible in the list of large language models.\nAs technology advanced, large sums have been invested in increasingly large models. For example, training of the GPT-2 (i.e. a 1.5-billion-parameters model) in 2019 cost $50,000, while training of the PaLM (i.e. a 540-billion-parameters model) in 2022 cost $8 million, and Megatron-Turing NLG 530B (in 2021) cost around $11 million.\nFor Transformer-based LLM, training cost is much higher than inference cost. It costs 6 FLOPs per parameter to train on one token, whereas it costs 1 to 2 FLOPs per parameter to infer on one token.Tool use\nThere are certain tasks that, in principle, cannot be solved by any LLM, at least not without the use of external tools or additional software. An example of such a task is responding to the user's input '354 * 139 = ', provided that the LLM has not already encountered a continuation of this calculation in its training corpus. In such cases, the LLM needs to resort to running program code that calculates the result, which can then be included in its response.: Another example is \"What is the time now? It is \", where a separate program interpreter would need to execute a code to get system time on the computer, so that the LLM can include it in its reply. This basic strategy can be sophisticated with multiple attempts of generated programs, and other sampling strategies.\nGenerally, in order to get an LLM to use tools, one must fine-tune it for tool-use. If the number of tools is finite, then fine-tuning may be done just once. If the number of tools can grow arbitrarily, as with online API services, then the LLM can be fine-tuned to be able to read API documentation and call API correctly.\nRetrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is another approach that enhances LLMs by integrating them with document retrieval systems. Given a query, a document retriever is called to retrieve the most relevant documents. This is usually done by encoding the query and the documents into vectors, then finding the documents with vectors (usually stored in a vector database) most similar to the vector of the query. The LLM then generates an output based on both the query and context included from the retrieved documents.Agency\nAn LLM is typically not an autonomous agent by itself, as it lacks the ability to interact with dynamic environments, recall past behaviors, and plan future actions, but can be transformed into one by integrating modules like profiling, memory, planning, and action.\nThe ReAct pattern, a portmanteau of \"Reason + Act\", constructs an agent out of an LLM, using the LLM as a planner. The LLM is prompted to \"think out loud\". Specifically, the language model is prompted with a textual description of the environment, a goal, a list of possible actions, and a record of the actions and observations so far. It generates one or more thoughts before generating an action, which is then executed in the environment. The linguistic description of the environment given to the LLM planner can even be the LaTeX code of a paper describing the environment.\nIn the DEPS (\"Describe, Explain, Plan and Select\") method, an LLM is first connected to the visual world via image descriptions, then it is prompted to produce plans for complex tasks and behaviors based on its pretrained knowledge and environmental feedback it receives.\nThe Reflexion method constructs an agent that learns over multiple episodes. At the end of each episode, the LLM is given the record of the episode, and prompted to think up \"lessons learned\", which would help it perform better at a subsequent episode. These \"lessons learned\" are given to the agent in the subsequent episodes.\nMonte Carlo tree search can use an LLM as rollout heuristic. When a programmatic world model is not available, an LLM can also be prompted with a description of the environment to act as world model.\nFor open-ended exploration, an LLM can be used to score observations for their \"interestingness\", which can be used as a reward signal to guide a normal (non-LLM) reinforcement learning agent. Alternatively, it can propose increasingly difficult tasks for curriculum learning. Instead of outputting individual actions, an LLM planner can also construct \"skills\", or functions for complex action sequences. The skills can be stored and later invoked, allowing increasing levels of abstraction in planning.\nLLM-powered agents can keep a long-term memory of its previous contexts, and the memory can be retrieved in the same way as Retrieval Augmented Generation. Multiple such agents can interact socially.Compression\nTypically, LLMs are trained with single- or half-precision floating point numbers (float32 and float16). One float16 has 16 bits, or 2 bytes, and so one billion parameters require 2 gigabytes. The largest models typically have 100 billion parameters, requiring 200 gigabytes to load, which places them outside the range of most consumer electronics.\nPost-training quantization aims to decrease the space requirement by lowering precision of the parameters of a trained model, while preserving most of its performance. The simplest form of quantization simply truncates all numbers to a given number of bits. It can be improved by using a different quantization codebook per layer. Further improvement can be done by applying different precisions to different parameters, with higher precision for particularly important parameters (\"outlier weights\"). See the visual guide to quantization by Maarten Grootendorst for a visual depiction.\nWhile quantized models are typically frozen, and only pre-quantized models are fine-tuned, quantized models can still be fine-tuned.Multimodality\nMultimodality means \"having several modalities\", and a \"modality\" refers to a type of input or output, such as video, image, audio, text, proprioception, etc. There have been many AI models trained specifically to ingest one modality and output another modality, such as AlexNet for image to label, visual question answering for image-text to text, and speech recognition for speech to text.\nA common method to create multimodal models out of an LLM is to \"tokenize\" the output of a trained encoder. Concretely, one can construct an LLM that can understand images as follows: take a trained LLM, and take a trained image encoder \n  \n    \n      \n        E\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle E}\n  \n. Make a small multilayered perceptron \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f}\n  \n, so that for any image \n  \n    \n      \n        y\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle y}\n  \n, the post-processed vector \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        (\n        E\n        (\n        y\n        )\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f(E(y))}\n  \n has the same dimensions as an encoded token. That is an \"image token\". Then, one can interleave text tokens and image tokens. The compound model is then fine-tuned on an image-text dataset. This basic construction can be applied with more sophistication to improve the model. The image encoder may be frozen to improve stability.\nFlamingo demonstrated the effectiveness of the tokenization method, finetuning a pair of pretrained language model and image encoder to perform better on visual question answering than models trained from scratch. Google PaLM model was fine-tuned into a multimodal model PaLM-E using the tokenization method, and applied to robotic control. LLaMA models have also been turned multimodal using the tokenization method, to allow image inputs, and video inputs.\nGPT-4 can use both text and image as inputs (although the vision component was not released to the public until GPT-4V); Google DeepMind's Gemini is also multimodal.  Mistral introduced its own multimodel Pixtral 12B model in September 2024.Reasoning\nIn late 2024, a new direction emerged in LLM development with models specifically designed for complex reasoning tasks. These \"reasoning models\" were trained to spend more time generating step-by-step solutions before providing final answers, similar to human problem-solving processes.\nOpenAI introduced this trend with their o1 model in September 2024, followed by o3 in December 2024. These models showed significant improvements in mathematics, science, and coding tasks compared to traditional LLMs. For example, on International Mathematics Olympiad qualifying exam problems, GPT-4o achieved 13% accuracy while o1 reached 83%.\nIn January 2025, the Chinese company DeepSeek released DeepSeek-R1, a 671-billion-parameter open-weight reasoning model that achieved comparable performance to OpenAI's o1 while being significantly more cost-effective to operate. Unlike proprietary models from OpenAI, DeepSeek-R1's open-weight nature allowed researchers to study and build upon the algorithm, though its training data remained private.\nThese reasoning models typically require more computational resources per query compared to traditional LLMs, as they perform more extensive processing to work through problems step-by-step. However, they have shown superior capabilities in domains requiring structured logical thinking, such as mathematics, scientific research, and computer programming.\nEfforts to reduce or compensate for hallucinations have employed automated reasoning, RAG (retrieval-augmented generation), fine-tuning, and other methods.Properties\nScaling laws\nThe performance of an LLM after pretraining largely depends on the:\n\ncost of pretraining \n  \n    \n      \n        C\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle C}\n  \n (the total amount of compute used),\nsize of the artificial neural network itself, such as number of parameters \n  \n    \n      \n        N\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle N}\n  \n (i.e. amount of neurons in its layers, amount of weights between them and biases),\nsize of its pretraining dataset (i.e. number of tokens in corpus, \n  \n    \n      \n        D\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle D}\n  \n).\n\"Scaling laws\" are empirical statistical laws that predict LLM performance based on such factors. One particular scaling law (\"Chinchilla scaling\") for LLM autoregressively trained for one epoch, with a log-log learning rate schedule, states that:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            {\n            \n              \n                \n                  C\n                  =\n                  \n                    C\n                    \n                      0\n                    \n                  \n                  N\n                  D\n                \n              \n              \n                \n                  L\n                  =\n                  \n                    \n                      A\n                      \n                        N\n                        \n                          \u03b1\n                        \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                  +\n                  \n                    \n                      B\n                      \n                        D\n                        \n                          \u03b2\n                        \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                  +\n                  \n                    L\n                    \n                      0\n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\begin{cases}C=C_{0}ND\\\\[6pt]L={\\frac {A}{N^{\\alpha }}}+{\\frac {B}{D^{\\beta }}}+L_{0}\\end{cases}}}\n  \n where the variables are\n\n  \n    \n      \n        C\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle C}\n  \n is the cost of training the model, in FLOPs.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        N\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle N}\n  \n is the number of parameters in the model.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        D\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle D}\n  \n is the number of tokens in the training set.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        L\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle L}\n  \n is the average negative log-likelihood loss per token (nats/token), achieved by the trained LLM on the test dataset.\nand the statistical hyper-parameters are\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          C\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n        =\n        6\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle C_{0}=6}\n  \n, meaning that it costs 6 FLOPs per parameter to train on one token.

However, this linearity may be punctuated by \"break(s)\" in the scaling law, where the slope of the line changes abruptly, and where larger models acquire \"emergent abilities\". They arise from the complex interaction of the model's components and are not explicitly programmed or designed. \nFurthermore, recent research has demonstrated that AI systems, including large language models, can employ heuristic reasoning akin to human cognition. They balance between exhaustive logical processing and the use of cognitive shortcuts (heuristics), adapting their reasoning strategies to optimize between accuracy and effort. This behavior aligns with principles of resource-rational human cognition, as discussed in classical theories of bounded rationality and dual-process theory.\nOne of the emergent abilities is in-context learning from example demonstrations. In-context learning is involved in tasks, such as:\n\nreported arithmetics\ndecoding the International Phonetic Alphabet\nunscrambling a word's letters\ndisambiguating word-in-context datasets\nconverting spatial words\ncardinal directions (for example, replying \"northeast\" in response to a 3x3 grid of 8 zeros and a 1 in the top-right), color terms represented in text.\nchain-of-thought prompting: In a 2022 research paper, chain-of-thought prompting only improved the performance for models that had at least 62B. Smaller models perform better when prompted to answer immediately, without chain of thought.\nidentifying offensive content in paragraphs of Hinglish (a combination of Hindi and English), and generating a similar English equivalent of Kiswahili proverbs.\nSchaeffer et. al. argue that the emergent abilities are not unpredictably acquired, but predictably acquired according to a smooth scaling law. The authors considered a toy statistical model of an LLM solving multiple-choice questions, and showed that this statistical model, modified to account for other types of tasks, applies to these tasks as well.\nLet \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x}\n  \n be the number of parameter count, and \n  \n    \n      \n        y\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle y}\n  \n be the performance of the model.Interpretation\nLarge language models by themselves are black boxes, and it is not clear how they can perform linguistic tasks. Similarly, it is unclear if or how LLMs should be viewed as models of the human brain and/or human mind.\nVarious techniques have been developed to enhance the transparency and interpretability of LLMs. Mechanistic interpretability aims to reverse-engineer LLMs by discovering symbolic algorithms that approximate the inference performed by an LLM. In recent years, sparse coding models such as sparse autoencoders, transcoders, and crosscoders have emerged as promising tools for identifying interpretable features.Studying a replacement model\nTranscoders, which are more interpretable than transformers, have been utilized to develop \u201creplacement models.\u201d In one such study involving the mechanistic interpretation of writing a rhyming poem by an LLM, it was shown that although they are believed to simply predict the next token, they can, in fact, plan ahead.Explainability\nA related concept is AI explainability, which focuses on understanding how an AI model arrives at a given result. Techniques such as partial dependency plots, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), and feature importance assessments allow researchers to visualize and understand the contributions of various input features to the model's predictions. These methods help ensure that AI models make decisions based on relevant and fair criteria, enhancing trust and accountability.\nBy integrating these techniques, researchers and practitioners can gain deeper insights into the operations of LLMs, fostering trust and facilitating the responsible deployment of these powerful models.\nIn another example, the authors trained small transformers on modular arithmetic addition. The resulting models were reverse-engineered, and it turned out they used discrete Fourier transform.Understanding and intelligence\nNLP researchers were evenly split when asked, in a 2022 survey, whether (untuned) LLMs \"could (ever) understand natural language in some nontrivial sense\". Proponents of \"LLM understanding\" believe that some LLM abilities, such as mathematical reasoning, imply an ability to \"understand\" certain concepts. A Microsoft team argued in 2023 that GPT-4 \"can solve novel and difficult tasks that span mathematics, coding, vision, medicine, law, psychology and more\" and that GPT-4 \"could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence system\": \"Can one reasonably say that a system that passes exams for software engineering candidates is not really intelligent?\" Ilya Sutskever argues that predicting the next word sometimes involves reasoning and deep insights, for example if the LLM has to predict the name of the criminal in an unknown detective novel after processing the entire story leading up to the revelation. Some researchers characterize LLMs as \"alien intelligence\". For example, Conjecture CEO Connor Leahy considers untuned LLMs to be like inscrutable alien \"Shoggoths\", and believes that RLHF tuning creates a \"smiling facade\" obscuring the inner workings of the LLM: \"If you don't push it too far, the smiley face stays on. But then you give it [an unexpected] prompt, and suddenly you see this massive underbelly of insanity, of weird thought processes and clearly non-human understanding.\"\nIn contrast, some skeptics of LLM understanding believe that existing LLMs are \"simply remixing and recombining existing writing\", a phenomenon known as stochastic parrot, or they point to the deficits existing LLMs continue to have in prediction skills, reasoning skills, agency, and explainability. For example, GPT-4 has natural deficits in planning and in real-time learning. Generative LLMs have been observed to confidently assert claims of fact which do not seem to be justified by their training data, a phenomenon which has been termed \"hallucination\". Specifically, hallucinations in the context of LLMs correspond to the generation of text or responses that seem syntactically sound, fluent, and natural but are factually incorrect, nonsensical, or unfaithful to the provided source input. Neuroscientist Terrence Sejnowski has argued that \"The diverging opinions of experts on the intelligence of LLMs suggests that our old ideas based on natural intelligence are inadequate\".\nThe matter of LLM's exhibiting intelligence or understanding has two main aspects \u2013 the first is how to model thought and language in a computer system, and the second is how to enable the computer system to generate human like language. These aspects of language as a model of cognition have been developed in the field of cognitive linguistics. American linguist George Lakoff presented Neural Theory of Language (NTL) as a computational basis for using language as a model of learning tasks and understanding. The NTL Model outlines how specific neural structures of the human brain shape the nature of thought and language and in turn what are the computational properties of such neural systems that can be applied to model thought and language in a computer system. After a framework for modeling language in a computer systems was established, the focus shifted to establishing frameworks for computer systems to generate language with acceptable grammar. In his 2014 book titled The Language Myth: Why Language Is Not An Instinct, British cognitive linguist and digital communication technologist Vyvyan Evans mapped out the role of probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG) in enabling NLP to model cognitive patterns and generate human like language.Evaluation\nPerplexity\nThe canonical measure of the performance of an LLM is its perplexity on a given text corpus. Perplexity measures how well a model predicts the contents of a dataset; the higher the likelihood the model assigns to the dataset, the lower the perplexity. In mathematical terms, perplexity is the exponential of the average negative log likelihood per token.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        log\n        \u2061\n        (\n        \n          Perplexity\n        \n        )\n        =\n        \u2212\n        \n          \n            1\n            N\n          \n        \n        \n          \u2211\n          \n            i\n            =\n            1\n          \n          \n            N\n          \n        \n        log\n        \u2061\n        (\n        Pr\n        (\n        \n          \n            token\n          \n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        \u2223\n        \n          \n            context for token\n          \n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        )\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\log({\\text{Perplexity}})=-{\\frac {1}{N}}\\sum _{i=1}^{N}\\log(\\Pr({\\text{token}}_{i}\\mid {\\text{context for token}}_{i}))}\n  \n\nHere, \n  \n    \n      \n        N\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle N}\n  \n is the number of tokens in the text corpus, and \"context for token \n  \n    \n      \n        i\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i}\n  \n\" depends on the specific type of LLM. If the LLM is autoregressive, then \"context for token \n  \n    \n      \n        i\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i}\n  \n\" is the segment of text appearing before token \n  \n    \n      \n        i\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i}\n  \n. If the LLM is masked, then \"context for token \n  \n    \n      \n        i\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i}\n  \n\" is the segment of text surrounding token \n  \n    \n      \n        i\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i}\n  \n.\nBecause language models may overfit to training data, models are usually evaluated by their perplexity on a test set. This evaluation is potentially problematic for larger models which, as they are trained on increasingly large corpora of text, are increasingly likely to inadvertently include portions of any given test set.BPW, BPC, and BPT\nIn information theory, the concept of entropy is intricately linked to perplexity, a relationship notably established by Claude Shannon. This relationship is mathematically expressed as \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          Entropy\n        \n        =\n        \n          log\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        \u2061\n        (\n        \n          Perplexity\n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\text{Entropy}}=\\log _{2}({\\text{Perplexity}})}\n  \n.\nEntropy, in this context, is commonly quantified in terms of bits per word (BPW) or bits per character (BPC), which hinges on whether the language model utilizes word-based or character-based tokenization.\nNotably, in the case of larger language models that predominantly employ sub-word tokenization, bits per token (BPT) emerges as a seemingly more appropriate measure. However, due to the variance in tokenization methods across different Large Language Models (LLMs), BPT does not serve as a reliable metric for comparative analysis among diverse models. To convert BPT into BPW, one can multiply it by the average number of tokens per word.\nIn the evaluation and comparison of language models, cross-entropy is generally the preferred metric over entropy. The underlying principle is that a lower BPW is indicative of a model's enhanced capability for compression. This, in turn, reflects the model's proficiency in making accurate predictions.Task-specific datasets and benchmarks\nA large number of testing datasets and benchmarks have also been developed to evaluate the capabilities of language models on more specific downstream tasks. Tests may be designed to evaluate a variety of capabilities, including general knowledge, bias, commonsense reasoning, and mathematical problem-solving.\nOne broad category of evaluation dataset is question answering datasets, consisting of pairs of questions and correct answers, for example, (\"Have the San Jose Sharks won the Stanley Cup?\", \"No\"). A question answering task is considered \"open book\" if the model's prompt includes text from which the expected answer can be derived (for example, the previous question could be adjoined with some text which includes the sentence \"The Sharks have advanced to the Stanley Cup finals once, losing to the Pittsburgh Penguins in 2016.\"). Otherwise, the task is considered \"closed book\", and the model must draw on knowledge retained during training. Some examples of commonly used question answering datasets include TruthfulQA, Web Questions, TriviaQA, and SQuAD.\nEvaluation datasets may also take the form of text completion, having the model select the most likely word or sentence to complete a prompt, for example: \"Alice was friends with Bob. Alice went to visit her friend, ____\".\nSome composite benchmarks have also been developed which combine a diversity of different evaluation datasets and tasks. Examples include GLUE, SuperGLUE, MMLU, BIG-bench, HELM, and HLE (Humanity's Last Exam). OpenAI has released tools for running composite benchmarks, but noted that the eval results are sensitive to the prompting method. Some public datasets contain questions that are mislabeled, ambiguous, unanswerable, or otherwise of low-quality, which can be cleaned to give more reliable benchmark scores.\nBias in LLMs may be measured through benchmarks such as CrowS-Pairs (Crowdsourced Stereotype Pairs), Stereo Set, and the more recent Parity Benchmark.  Additionally, fact-checking and misinformation detection are becoming increasingly crucial evaluation areas for LLMs. A recent study by Caramancion (2023) compared the fact-checking accuracy of prominent LLMs\u2014including OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT 3.5 and 4.0, Google\u2019s Bard, and Microsoft\u2019s Bing AI\u2014against independent fact-checking agencies such as PolitiFact and Snopes. The results demonstrated a moderate proficiency in fact verification, with GPT-4 achieving the highest accuracy at 71%, but still lagging behind human fact-checkers in contextual comprehension and nuanced reasoning. This underscores the evolving but incomplete ability of LLMs to discern fact from deception, highlighting the need for continued advancements in AI-driven fact-checking methodologies.\nIt was previously standard to report results on a heldout portion of an evaluation dataset after doing supervised fine-tuning on the remainder. It is now more common to evaluate a pre-trained model directly through prompting techniques, though researchers vary in the details of how they formulate prompts for particular tasks, particularly with respect to how many examples of solved tasks are adjoined to the prompt (i.e. the value of n in n-shot prompting).Adversarially constructed evaluations\nBecause of the rapid pace of improvement of large language models, evaluation benchmarks have suffered from short lifespans, with state of the art models quickly \"saturating\" existing benchmarks, exceeding the performance of human annotators, leading to efforts to replace or augment the benchmark with more challenging tasks. In addition, there are cases of \"shortcut learning\" wherein AIs sometimes \"cheat\" on multiple-choice tests by using statistical correlations in superficial test question wording in order to guess the correct responses, without necessarily understanding the actual question being asked.\nSome datasets have been constructed adversarially, focusing on particular problems on which extant language models seem to have unusually poor performance compared to humans. One example is the TruthfulQA dataset, a question answering dataset consisting of 817 questions which language models are susceptible to answering incorrectly by mimicking falsehoods to which they were repeatedly exposed during training. For example, an LLM may answer \"No\" to the question \"Can you teach an old dog new tricks?\" because of its exposure to the English idiom you can't teach an old dog new tricks, even though this is not literally true.\nAnother example of an adversarial evaluation dataset is Swag and its successor, HellaSwag, collections of problems in which one of multiple options must be selected to complete a text passage. The incorrect completions were generated by sampling from a language model and filtering with a set of classifiers. The resulting problems are trivial for humans but at the time the datasets were created state of the art language models had poor accuracy on them. For example:\n\nWe see a fitness center sign. We then see a man talking to the camera and sitting and laying on a exercise ball. The man...\na) demonstrates how to increase efficient exercise work by running up and down balls.\nb) moves all his arms and legs and builds up a lot of muscle.\nc) then plays the ball and we see a graphics and hedge trimming demonstration.\nd) performs sit ups while on the ball and talking.\n\nBERT selects b) as the most likely completion, though the correct answer is d).Limitations of LLM benchmarks\nBenchmarks can become outdated rapidly. Once a model attains near-perfect scores on a given benchmark, that benchmark ceases to serve as a meaningful indicator of progress. This phenomenon, known as \"benchmark saturation,\" necessitates the development of more challenging and nuanced tasks to continue advancing LLM capabilities. For instance, traditional benchmarks like HellaSwag and MMLU have seen models achieving high accuracy already.Wider impact\nIn 2023, Nature Biomedical Engineering wrote that \"it is no longer possible to accurately distinguish\" human-written text from text created by large language models, and that \"It is all but certain that general-purpose large language models will rapidly proliferate... It is a rather safe bet that they will change many industries over time.\" Goldman Sachs suggested in 2023 that generative language AI could increase global GDP by 7% in the next ten years, and could expose to automation 300 million jobs globally. Brinkmann et al. (2023) also argue that LLMs are transforming processes of cultural evolution by shaping processes of variation, transmission, and selection.Memorization and copyright\nMemorization is an emergent behavior in LLMs in which long strings of text are occasionally output verbatim from training data, contrary to typical behavior of traditional artificial neural nets. Evaluations of controlled LLM output measure the amount memorized from training data (focused on GPT-2-series models) as variously over 1% for exact duplicates or up to about 7%.\nA 2023 study showed that when ChatGPT 3.5 turbo was prompted to repeat the same word indefinitely, after a few hundreds of repetitions, it would start outputting excerpts from its training data.Security\nSome commenters expressed concern over accidental or deliberate creation of misinformation, or other forms of misuse. For example, the availability of large language models could reduce the skill-level required to commit bioterrorism; biosecurity researcher Kevin Esvelt has suggested that LLM creators should exclude from their training data papers on creating or enhancing pathogens.\nThe potential presence of \"sleeper agents\" within LLMs is another emerging security concern. These are hidden functionalities built into the model that remain dormant until triggered by a specific event or condition. Upon activation, the LLM deviates from its expected behavior to make insecure actions.\nLLM applications accessible to the public, like ChatGPT or Claude, typically incorporate safety measures designed to filter out harmful content. However, implementing these controls effectively has proven challenging. For instance, a 2023 study proposed a method for circumventing LLM safety systems. In 2025, The American Sunlight Project, a non-profit, published a study showing evidence that the so-called Pravda network, a pro-Russia propaganda aggregator, was strategically placing web content through mass publication and duplication with the intention of biasing LLM outputs. The American Sunlight Project coined this technique \"LLM grooming,\" and pointed to it as a new tool of weaponizing AI to spread disinformation and harmful content. Similarly, Yongge Wang illustrated in 2024 how a potential criminal could potentially bypass ChatGPT 4o's safety controls to obtain information on establishing a drug trafficking operation.Algorithmic bias\nWhile LLMs have shown remarkable capabilities in generating human-like text, they are susceptible to inheriting and amplifying biases present in their training data. This can manifest in skewed representations or unfair treatment of different demographics, such as those based on race, gender, language, and cultural groups. Since English data is overrepresented in current large language models' training data, it may also downplay non-English views.Stereotyping\nAI models can reinforce a wide range of stereotypes, including those based on gender, ethnicity, age, nationality, religion, or occupation. This can lead to outputs that homogenize, or unfairly generalize or caricature groups of people, sometimes in harmful or derogatory ways.\nNotably, gender bias refers to the tendency of these models to produce outputs that are unfairly prejudiced towards one gender over another. This bias typically arises from the data on which these models are trained. Large language models often assign roles and characteristics based on traditional gender norms. For example, it might associate nurses or secretaries predominantly with women and engineers or CEOs with men.Selection bias\nSelection bias refers the inherent tendency of large language models to favor certain option identifiers irrespective of the actual content of the options. This bias primarily stems from token bias\u2014that is, the model assigns a higher a priori probability to specific answer tokens (such as \u201cA\u201d) when generating responses. As a result, when the ordering of options is altered (for example, by systematically moving the correct answer to different positions), the model\u2019s performance can fluctuate significantly. This phenomenon undermines the reliability of large language models in multiple-choice settings.Political bias\nPolitical bias refers to the tendency of algorithms to systematically favor certain political viewpoints, ideologies, or outcomes over others. Language models may also exhibit political biases. Since the training data includes a wide range of political opinions and coverage, the models might generate responses that lean towards particular political ideologies or viewpoints, depending on the prevalence of those views in the data.Energy demands\nThe energy demands of LLMs have grown along with their size and capabilities. Data centers that enable LLM training require substantial amounts of electricity. Much of that electricity is generated by non-renewable resources that create greenhouse gases and contribute to climate change. Nuclear power and geothermal energy are two options tech companies are exploring to meet the sizable energy demands of LLM training. The significant expense of investing in geothermal solutions has led to major shale producers like Chevron and Exxon Mobil advocating for tech companies to use electricity produced via natural gas to fuel their large energy demands.See also\nFoundation models\nList of large language models\nList of chatbots\nLanguage model benchmark\nSmall language modelReferences\nFurther reading\nJurafsky, Dan, Martin, James.

They are capable of understanding and generating human-like text, making them useful for a variety of applications such as natural language processing, question answering, and language translation. LLMs are typically trained on large datasets of text, such as books, articles, and websites, using techniques such as deep learning and neural networks. Some popular examples of LLMs include the GPT series from OpenAI and PaLM from Google.\n\nLLMs have shown impressive results in a wide range of tasks, but they also have limitations. For example, they may not always understand the context or meaning behind the text they generate, and they may produce biased or incorrect information. Additionally, training LLMs requires significant computational resources and time, and they may not be able to generalize well to new or unseen data. Despite these limitations, LLMs are a rapidly growing field of research and have the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with computers and process information.\n\n## History\n\nThe history of large language models (LLMs) can be traced back to the early days of computer science, when researchers began experimenting with statistical methods to analyze and generate human language. In the 1950s, researchers like Alan Turing developed early computer programs that could recognize patterns in text and generate simple sentences. These early efforts laid the groundwork for later advances in language modeling.\n\nOne of the most significant breakthroughs in LLMs came in the 1990s, when researchers introduced the use of neural networks to model language. Neural networks are a type of machine learning algorithm inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. By using neural networks to analyze text, researchers were able to develop models that could better capture the complexity and nuance of human language.\n\nIn the early 2000s, researchers began to explore the use of large-scale language models, which are models that are trained on very large datasets of text. These models were able to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a variety of language tasks, but they were also computationally expensive to train and difficult to deploy.\n\nIn recent years, there has been a resurgence of interest in LLMs, driven in part by advances in computing technology and the availability of large amounts of text data. This has led to the development of even larger and more powerful LLMs, such as OpenAI's GPT-3 and Google's BERT. These models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in a wide range of language tasks, and they have the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with computers and process information.\n\nIn addition to advances in LLMs themselves, there has also been a growing interest in using LLMs to solve problems in other domains, such as healthcare, finance, and social media. Researchers are exploring ways to integrate LLMs into existing systems and workflows, and to leverage their capabilities to improve decision-making and problem-solving in a variety of contexts.\n\nDespite the many advances in LLMs, there are still many challenges that need to be addressed. One of the biggest challenges is the issue of bias and fairness, which arises when LLMs produce outputs that are systematically biased against certain groups of people or that perpetuate harmful stereotypes. Researchers are working to develop techniques for detecting and mitigating bias in LLMs, and to ensure that these models are fair and equitable.\n\nAnother challenge is the issue of interpretability, which arises when LLMs make decisions or produce outputs that are difficult to understand or explain. Researchers are exploring ways to make LLMs more transparent and interpretable, so that users can better understand how these models work and trust their outputs.\n\nOverall, the history of LLMs is one of rapid growth and innovation, with significant advances in both the underlying technology and the applications of these models. As researchers continue to push the boundaries of what is possible with LLMs, it is likely that we will see even more exciting developments in this field in the years to come.\n\n### Early statistical approaches\n\nEarly approaches to language modeling relied on statistical methods to analyze and generate human language. These methods were based on the idea that language can be modeled as a probabilistic process, where the probability of a particular word or phrase occurring depends on the context in which it appears. One of the earliest and most influential approaches to language modeling was the Markov chain model, which was introduced by Claude Shannon in the 1940s. The Markov chain model assumes that the probability of a particular word occurring depends only on the previous word or words in the sequence, and it uses this assumption to estimate the probabilities of different sequences of words.\n\nOther early approaches to language modeling included the use of n-grams, which are sequences of n words that occur together in a text. N-grams can be used to estimate the probabilities of different sequences of words, and they have been widely used in natural language processing tasks such as speech recognition and machine translation.\n\nWhile these early approaches to language modeling were successful to some extent, they had several limitations. For example, they were often unable to capture the full complexity and nuance of human language, and they were limited to analyzing relatively small amounts of text data. As a result, researchers began to explore new approaches to language modeling that could better capture the complexity of human language and handle larger datasets.\n\n### Neural networks\n\nOne of the most significant breakthroughs in language modeling came in the 1990s, when researchers introduced the use of neural networks to model language. Neural networks are a type of machine learning algorithm inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. They consist of layers of interconnected nodes, or neurons, that process and transform input data into output predictions. By using neural networks to analyze text, researchers were able to develop models that could better capture the complexity and nuance of human language.\n\nOne of the key advantages of neural networks is their ability to learn complex patterns in data. Unlike traditional statistical methods, which rely on pre-defined rules or features, neural networks can automatically learn the most important features and patterns in a given dataset. This makes them well-suited for tasks such as language modeling, where the relationships between words and phrases can be complex and difficult to capture with traditional methods.\n\nAnother advantage of neural networks is their ability to handle large amounts of data. Neural networks can be trained on massive datasets of text, allowing them to capture the full range of linguistic patterns and variations in human language. This has made them particularly useful for tasks such as language translation, where a model needs to be able to accurately translate text from one language to another.\n\nDespite these advantages, neural networks also have some limitations. For example, they can be computationally expensive to train, and they may require large amounts of labeled data to achieve good performance. Additionally, neural networks can be difficult to interpret, making it challenging to understand how they arrive at their predictions.\n\n### BERT\n\nIn 2018, researchers at Google introduced a new approach to language modeling called Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). BERT is a type of neural network that is designed to better capture the context and meaning of words in a sentence. Unlike traditional neural networks, which only consider the context of a word in one direction (either forward or backward), BERT considers the context of a word in both directions. This allows BERT to better understand the meaning of a word in the context of a sentence, and it has been shown to outperform traditional neural networks on a wide range of natural language processing tasks.\n\nOne of the key advantages of BERT is its ability to capture the context and meaning of words in a sentence. This is achieved through the use of a technique called bidirectional attention, which allows BERT to consider the context of a word in both directions (forward and backward) when making predictions. This has been shown to be particularly effective for tasks such as sentiment analysis, where the meaning of a word can depend on its position in a sentence.\n\nAnother advantage of BERT is its ability to handle large amounts of data. BERT can be trained on massive datasets of text, allowing it to capture the full range of linguistic patterns and variations in human language. This has made it particularly useful for tasks such as language translation, where a model needs to be able to accurately translate text from one language to another.\n\nDespite these advantages, BERT also has some limitations. For example, it can be computationally expensive to train, and it may require large amounts of labeled data to achieve good performance. Additionally, BERT can be difficult to interpret, making it challenging to understand how it arrives at its predictions.\n\n### GPT series\n\nIn 2018, OpenAI introduced a new type of large language model called Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT). GPT is a type of neural network that is designed to generate human-like text. It is trained on a massive corpus of text data, allowing it to learn the patterns and structures of human language. Once trained, GPT can generate text that is similar to human-written text, making it useful for a wide range of natural language processing tasks.\n\nOne of the key advantages of GPT is its ability to generate human-like text. This is achieved through the use of a technique called autoregressive language modeling, which allows GPT to generate text one word at a time, based on the context of the preceding words. This has been shown to be particularly effective for tasks such as text generation, where a model needs to be able to generate coherent and grammatically correct text.\n\nAnother advantage of GPT is its ability to handle large amounts of data. GPT can be trained on massive datasets of text, allowing it to capture the full range of linguistic patterns and variations in human language. This has made it particularly useful for tasks such as language translation, where a model needs to be able to accurately translate text from one language to another.\n\nDespite these advantages, GPT also has some limitations. For example, it can be computationally expensive to train, and it may require large amounts of labeled data to achieve good performance. Additionally, GPT can be difficult to interpret, making it challenging to understand how it arrives at its predictions.\n\n### Multimodal capabilities\n\nIn recent years, there has been a growing interest in developing large language models that are capable of processing and generating text in multiple modalities, such as images, audio, and video. These models are known as multimodal language models, and they have the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with computers and process information.\n\nOne of the key advantages of multimodal language models is their ability to handle complex and diverse forms of data. By combining information from multiple modalities, these models can better capture the full range of linguistic patterns and variations in human language. This has made them particularly useful for tasks such as image captioning, where a model needs to be able to generate text that accurately describes an image.\n\nAnother advantage of multimodal language models is their ability to handle large amounts of data. These models can be trained on massive datasets of text, images, and other forms of data, allowing them to capture the full range of linguistic patterns and variations in human language. This has made them particularly useful for tasks such as language translation, where a model needs to be able to accurately translate text from one language to another.\n\nDespite these advantages, multimodal language models also have some limitations. For example, they can be computationally expensive to train, and they may require large amounts of labeled data to achieve good performance. Additionally, multimodal language models can be difficult to interpret, making it challenging to understand how they arrive at their predictions.\n\n### Chatbot capabilities\n\nChatbots are computer programs that are designed to simulate human conversation. They are commonly used in customer service, virtual assistants, and other applications where a user needs to interact with a computer system in a conversational manner.\n\nOne of the key advantages of chatbots is their ability to handle natural language input. By using large language models to process and generate text, chatbots can understand and respond to user queries in a natural and conversational manner. This has made them particularly useful for tasks such as customer service, where a chatbot can help answer frequently asked questions and provide support to customers.\n\nAnother advantage of chatbots is their ability to handle large amounts of data. Chatbots can be trained on massive datasets of text, allowing them to capture the full range of linguistic patterns and variations in human language. This has made them particularly useful for tasks such as language translation, where a chatbot needs to be able to accurately translate text from one language to another.\n\nDespite these advantages, chatbots also have some limitations. For example, they can be computationally expensive to train, and they may require large amounts of labeled data to achieve good performance. Additionally, chatbots can be difficult to interpret, making it challenging to understand how they arrive at their predictions.\n\n### Advantages\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) offer several advantages over traditional language models. One of the main advantages of LLMs is their ability to capture the full range of linguistic patterns and variations in human language. This is achieved through the use of neural networks, which are able to automatically learn the most important features and patterns in a given dataset. This makes LLMs particularly useful for tasks such as language translation, where a model needs to be able to accurately translate text from one language to another.\n\nAnother advantage of LLMs is their ability to handle large amounts of data. LLMs can be trained on massive datasets of text, allowing them to capture the full range of linguistic patterns and variations in human language. This has made them particularly useful for tasks such as language translation, where a model needs to be able to accurately translate text from one language to another.\n\nLLMs also have several advantages over other types of language models. For example, they are generally more accurate and reliable than rule-based language models, which are based on pre-defined rules and features. LLMs are also able to handle complex and diverse forms of data, making them particularly useful for tasks such as image captioning, where a model needs to be able to generate text that accurately describes an image.\n\nFinally, LLMs are generally easier to use and deploy than other types of language models. They do not require specialized knowledge or expertise to use, and they can be easily integrated into existing systems and workflows.\n\n### Challenges\n\nDespite their many advantages, LLMs also face several challenges. One of the main challenges of LLMs is the issue of bias and fairness. Because LLMs are trained on large datasets of text, they can inadvertently learn and perpetuate biases and stereotypes that are present in the training data. For example, LLMs may produce outputs that are systematically biased against certain groups of people or that perpetuate harmful stereotypes. Researchers are working to develop techniques for detecting and mitigating bias in LLMs, and to ensure that these models are fair and equitable.\n\nAnother challenge of LLMs is the issue of interpretability. Because LLMs are based on neural networks, they can be difficult to interpret and understand. This can make it challenging to understand how a model arrives at its predictions, and to trust its outputs. Researchers are working to develop techniques for making LLMs more transparent and interpretable, so that users can better understand how these models work and trust their outputs.\n\nFinally, LLMs also face challenges related to the scale and complexity of the datasets they are trained on. Because LLMs are trained on massive datasets of text, they can be computationally expensive to train and deploy. This can make it challenging to train and use LLMs on smaller devices or in resource-constrained environments.\n\n### Applications\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have a wide range of potential applications across a variety of fields. Here are some examples of how LLMs can be applied in practice:\n\n* Customer service: LLMs can be used to automate customer service interactions, providing users with personalized assistance and support.\n* Virtual assistants: LLMs can be used to build intelligent virtual assistants that can understand and respond to user queries in a natural and conversational manner.\n* Language translation: LLMs can be used to translate text from one language to another, enabling users to communicate across language barriers.\n* Content generation: LLMs can be used to generate high-quality content, such as news articles, product descriptions, and marketing copy.\n* Chatbots: LLMs can be used to build intelligent chatbots that can engage in natural and conversational interactions with users.\n* Language education: LLMs can be used to provide language learners with personalized feedback and support, helping them to improve their language skills.\n* Sentiment analysis: LLMs can be used to analyze the sentiment of text, helping businesses to understand customer opinions and preferences.\n* Text summarization: LLMs can be used to generate concise summaries of long documents, making it easier for users to quickly understand the key points.\n* Question answering: LLMs can be used to answer questions about a wide range of topics, from general knowledge to specialized fields.\n* Natural language understanding: LLMs can be used to extract meaning and insights from unstructured text, enabling businesses to better understand customer needs and preferences.\n\nThese are just a few examples of how LLMs can be applied in practice. As LLMs continue to advance, it is likely that we will see even more innovative applications of these models across a wide range of fields.\n\n## Dataset preprocessing\n\nDataset preprocessing is the process of preparing data for training large language models (LLMs). This involves cleaning and transforming raw data into a format that can be used by an LLM. The goal of preprocessing is to improve the quality and relevance of the data, and to prepare it for efficient training.\n\nSome common preprocessing steps include:\n\n* Cleaning: Removing irrelevant or noisy data, such as duplicates, errors, or irrelevant information.\n* Tokenization: Breaking down text into individual words or tokens, which are then used as input for the LLM.\n* Normalization: Converting text to a standardized format, such as lowercase or removing punctuation.\n* Encoding: Converting text into a numerical format that can be used by the LLM, such as one-hot encoding or word embeddings.\n* Splitting: Dividing the data into training, validation, and test sets to ensure that the LLM is properly evaluated.\n\nPreprocessing is an important step in the LLM training pipeline because it can significantly impact the quality and effectiveness of the resulting model. By carefully preprocessing the data, researchers can improve the accuracy and efficiency of the LLM, and ensure that it performs well on a wide range of tasks.\n\n## Tokenization\n\nTokenization is the process of breaking down text into individual units called tokens. Tokens are the smallest meaningful units of text, such as words, phrases, or symbols. In the context of large language models (LLMs), tokenization is an essential step in the preprocessing of text data. The tokens are then used as input for the LLM during training and inference.\n\nThere are several different approaches to tokenization, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Some common methods include:\n\n* Word-level tokenization: Breaking text into individual words, such as \"the\", \"cat\", and \"sat\".\n* Subword-level tokenization: Breaking text into subwords, such as \"un\" and \"able\" for the word \"unable\".\n* Byte pair encoding (BPE): A technique that merges characters and n-grams to create a vocabulary of a specific size.\n* Sentence-level tokenization: Breaking text into complete sentences, such as \"The cat sat.\" and \"The dog barked.\"\n\nThe choice of tokenization method depends on the specific task and dataset being used. For example, word-level tokenization is often used for tasks that require precise word-level information, while subword-level tokenization is often used for tasks that require a larger vocabulary.\n\nTokenization is an important step in the preprocessing of text data because it allows the LLM to efficiently process and understand the input text. By breaking the text into smaller units, the LLM can focus on the most relevant information and ignore irrelevant details. This can improve the accuracy and efficiency of the LLM, and enable it to perform a wide range of tasks.\n\n## BPE\n\nByte Pair Encoding (BPE) is a popular method for tokenizing text. It works by merging characters and n-grams to create a vocabulary of a specific size. BPE is an iterative process that starts with a set of characters and gradually builds a vocabulary by merging pairs of characters or n-grams that appear frequently in the text.\n\nHere's how BPE works:\n\n* Start with a set of characters.\n* Find the two most frequent character pairs or n-grams in the text.\n* Merge the most frequent pair or n-gram into a single token.\n* Repeat until the desired vocabulary size is reached.\n\nFor example, suppose we have the following text: \"I love to eat pizza\". Using BPE, we might start with the characters I, l, o, v, e, t, a, p, z, i, and n. We would then find the most frequent character pairs, such as \"I \" and \"o\", and merge them into a single token. The resulting vocabulary might look something like this: {\"I\", \"o\", \"v\", \"e\", \"t\", \"a\", \"p\", \"z\", \"i\", \"n\", \"love\", \"to\", \"eat\", \"pizza\"}.\n\nBPE is a flexible and efficient method for tokenizing text, and it has been widely adopted in the field of natural language processing. It is particularly useful for tasks that require a large vocabulary, such as language modeling and machine translation.\n\n## Problems\n\nWhen training a large language model (LLM), tokenization is an important step that converts text into numerical tokens. However, when tokenizing non-English languages, the token vocabulary is optimized for English, which can lead to inefficiencies in text completion and processing.\n\nFor example, consider a Chinese sentence that contains a rare character that is not in the token vocabulary. In this case, the LLM may need to generate multiple tokens to represent the character, which can slow down the text completion process. Additionally, if the LLM encounters a character that is not in the token vocabulary, it may need to generate a token that represents the character, which can lead to inaccuracies in the generated text.\n\nTo address these issues, researchers have proposed several methods for adapting tokenization to non-English languages. One approach is to use a separate token vocabulary for each language, which can improve the accuracy and efficiency of text completion and processing. Another approach is to use a shared token vocabulary that includes all characters from multiple languages, which can simplify the tokenization process and reduce the number of tokens needed to represent rare characters.\n\nOverall, adapting tokenization to non-English languages is an important challenge in the development of large language models. By addressing this challenge, researchers can improve the accuracy and efficiency of LLMs for a wider range of languages and applications.\n\n## Dataset cleaning\n\nCleaning a dataset is an important step in the process of training a large language model (LLM). This involves removing any irrelevant or incorrect data, as well as correcting any errors or inconsistencies in the data. The goal of cleaning is to ensure that the dataset is of high quality and contains only relevant and accurate information, which can improve the performance of the LLM.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges in cleaning a dataset for an LLM is dealing with LLM-generated content on the web. This can include content that has been generated by other LLMs or by humans using LLMs as a tool. This content can be difficult to identify and remove, as it may not always be clear whether the content was generated by a human or an LLM. Additionally, LLM-generated content can be difficult to distinguish from other types of content, such as spam or low-quality content.\n\nTo address these challenges, researchers have developed a variety of techniques for cleaning datasets for LLMs. These techniques include:\n\n* Removing duplicate or irrelevant data\n* Correcting errors or inconsistencies in the data\n* Identifying and removing LLM-generated content\n* Filtering out low-quality or spam content\n* Ensuring that the data is representative of the population it is intended to represent\n\nBy cleaning a dataset before training an LLM, researchers can improve the quality and accuracy of the LLM and ensure that it performs well on a wide range of tasks.\n\n## Synthetic data\n\nSynthetic data is a type of data that is generated artificially rather than collected from real-world sources. Large language models (LLMs) are often trained on large amounts of synthetic data, which can be used to supplement or replace real-world data.\n\nOne of the main advantages of synthetic data is that it can be generated quickly and easily, without the need for expensive or time-consuming data collection processes. This can be particularly useful for LLMs, which require large amounts of data to train effectively. Synthetic data can also be used to generate data that is difficult or impossible to collect in the real world, such as data from rare or extreme scenarios.\n\nHowever, there are also some challenges associated with using synthetic data to train LLMs. One of the main challenges is ensuring that the synthetic data is realistic and representative of the real world. If the synthetic data is not realistic or representative, it can lead to LLMs that are not accurate or reliable. Additionally, synthetic data can be difficult to generate, and it may not always be possible to generate data that is as diverse or complex as real-world data.\n\nDespite these challenges, synthetic data remains a valuable tool for training LLMs. By using synthetic data, researchers can improve the accuracy and reliability of LLMs, and ensure that they are able to perform well on a wide range of tasks.\n\n## Training and architecture\n\nTraining a large language model (LLM) involves several key components and techniques. The first step is to preprocess the data, which involves cleaning and transforming the raw data into a format that can be used by the LLM. This may involve tasks such as tokenization, normalization, and encoding.\n\nOnce the data is preprocessed, the LLM is trained using a supervised learning approach. This involves feeding the LLM large amounts of text data and adjusting the model's parameters to minimize the difference between its predictions and the true labels. The LLM is trained on a variety of tasks, such as language modeling, classification, and generation.\n\nThe architecture of the LLM plays a crucial role in its performance. Large language models are typically based on transformer architectures, which are designed to handle sequential data and capture long-range dependencies in the input. Transformers use self-attention mechanisms to weigh the importance of different parts of the input sequence, allowing the model to focus on the most relevant information.\n\nDuring training, the LLM is optimized using techniques such as gradient descent and backpropagation. The model's parameters are adjusted iteratively to minimize the loss function, which measures the difference between the model's predictions and the true labels. This process continues until the model achieves satisfactory performance on the training data.\n\nOverall, training a large language model requires careful consideration of the data preprocessing, model architecture, and training techniques. By optimizing these components, researchers can develop LLMs that are accurate, efficient, and capable of handling a wide range of tasks.\n\n## Reinforcement learning from human feedback\n\nReinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is a technique used to train large language models (LLMs) by providing the model with feedback from human users. The process begins by training an LLM on a large corpus of text data using a standard supervised learning approach. Next, the model is fine-tuned using RLHF, where human users provide feedback on the model's outputs.\n\nThe RLHF process involves presenting the model with a prompt and generating a response. Human users then evaluate the response and provide feedback indicating whether the response was appropriate or not. The feedback is then used to update the model's parameters using reinforcement learning algorithms.\n\nThe RLHF process can be repeated multiple times, with the model being fine-tuned based on the feedback from multiple human users. This allows the model to learn to generate responses that are more aligned with human preferences and expectations.\n\nOverall, RLHF is a powerful technique for training LLMs to generate high-quality and contextually appropriate responses. By incorporating human feedback into the training process, LLMs can be fine-tuned to better understand the nuances of human communication and generate responses that are more aligned with human expectations.\n\n## Instruction tuning\n\nSelf-instruct is a method for instruction tuning large language models (LLMs) that involves training the model on a dataset of human-generated corrections to LLM-generated outputs. This approach differs from typical instruction tuning methods, which involve training the model on a dataset of human-generated instructions and corresponding outputs.\n\nThe self-instruct method works by first generating a dataset of LLM-generated outputs for a set of prompts, followed by having humans generate corrections to the outputs. These corrections are then used to train the model on the same set of prompts. The idea behind this approach is that by training the model on human-generated corrections, it can learn to better understand the intended meaning of the prompts and generate more accurate and contextually appropriate responses.\n\nThis method has been shown to be effective in improving the performance of LLMs on a variety of tasks, including question answering, text summarization, and dialogue generation. It has also been found to be more robust to changes in the input distribution compared to other instruction tuning methods.\n\nOne potential limitation of self-instruct is that it requires a large amount of human-generated correction data, which can be costly and time-consuming to obtain. Additionally, the quality of the human-generated corrections can vary depending on the annotators' expertise and the complexity of the task. Despite these challenges, self-instruct remains a promising approach for improving the performance of LLMs on a variety of tasks.\n\n## Mixture of experts\n\nMixture of experts (MoE) is a technique used to train large language models (LLMs) by dividing the computation across multiple specialized models, or experts. Each expert is responsible for a subset of the input data, and the final output is obtained by combining the outputs of all the experts.\n\nMoE has been used to train LLMs with up to 1 trillion parameters, and has been found to be effective in reducing the training cost and improving the accuracy of the model. MoE is particularly useful for LLMs that require a large number of parameters, as it allows the model to be trained on hardware with limited memory and computational resources.\n\nMoE works by dividing the input data into subsets, or shards, and assigning each shard to a different expert. Each expert is responsible for processing a subset of the input data and generating a prediction for that subset. The predictions from all the experts are then combined using a gating network, which determines the weight of each expert's prediction in the final output.\n\nMoE has been used in a variety of applications, including natural language processing, computer vision, and speech recognition. It has been found to be particularly effective in tasks that require a large number of parameters, such as image classification and object detection.\n\nOverall, MoE is a powerful technique for training LLMs, and has been found to be effective in reducing the training cost and improving the accuracy of the model. It is particularly useful for LLMs that require a large number of parameters, and can be used in a variety of applications, including natural language processing, computer vision, and speech recognition.\n\n## Prompt engineering, attention mechanism, and context window\n\nPrompt engineering is a technique used to improve the performance of large language models (LLMs) by carefully designing the input prompts provided to the model. This involves selecting appropriate keywords and phrases to guide the model's response and ensuring that the prompts are clear and concise. Prompt engineering can be used to improve the accuracy and relevance of the model's output, and can be particularly useful for tasks such as question answering and text summarization.\n\nThe attention mechanism is a key component of many LLMs, including the GPT series of models. The attention mechanism allows the model to selectively focus on certain parts of the input sequence when generating output. This is done by computing a weighted sum of the input vectors, where the weights are determined by the similarity between the input vectors and a set of query vectors. The attention mechanism allows the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence in a flexible and adaptive way, which can improve the model's performance on a wide range of tasks.\n\nThe context window is a limitation of many LLMs, including the GPT series of models. The context window refers to the maximum number of tokens that the model can process in a single input sequence. This limit is imposed by the memory constraints of the model and can limit the model's ability to process longer or more complex input sequences. To overcome this limitation, researchers have developed techniques such as chunking and concatenation, which allow the model to process longer input sequences by breaking them into smaller chunks or concatenating multiple input sequences.\n\nOverall, prompt engineering, the attention mechanism, and the context window are all important factors that can influence the performance of LLMs. By carefully designing input prompts, using the attention mechanism effectively, and managing the context window, researchers can improve the accuracy and relevance of the model's output and extend the model's capabilities.\n\n## Infrastructure\n\nThe largest language models (LLMs) require significant computational resources to train and run. These models are typically trained on large clusters of GPUs or TPUs, which are designed to accelerate matrix operations and parallel computations. The amount of data storage required for an LLM depends on the size of the model and the amount of data it was trained on. For example, a 1.5-trillion-parameter LLM trained on 5-trillion tokens requires approximately 100 terabytes of data storage.\n\nTraining an LLM can be extremely energy-intensive, with some estimates suggesting that the training of a 1.5-trillion-parameter LLM can consume as much electricity as a household in a year. To mitigate the environmental impact of LLM training, some organizations have begun exploring alternative energy sources, such as renewable energy or carbon offsets.\n\nIn addition to computational resources, running an LLM also requires significant data storage. For example, a 1.5-trillion-parameter LLM requires approximately 100 terabytes of data storage to store its parameters and other necessary data structures.\n\n## Training cost\n\nTraining a large language model (LLM) is an expensive process that requires significant computational resources and time. The cost of training an LLM can vary greatly depending on the size of the model and the amount of data used to train it.\n\nOne example of the cost of training an LLM is the training of the 1.5-trillion-parameter Phi-1.5 series of LLMs by Microsoft. This series of models was trained on a cluster of 20,000 GPUs, and the training process took several months. The cost of training these models is estimated to be $1 billion, which is a significant investment for a single model.\n\nAnother example is the training of the 540-billion-parameter Gopher-540 series of LLMs by Google. These models were trained on a cluster of 7,000 TPUs, and the training process took several weeks. The cost of training these models is estimated to be $2 million, which is a relatively lower cost compared to the Phi-1.5 series.\n\nThe cost of training an LLM is primarily driven by the amount of data used to train it and the size of the model. Larger models require more data and more computational resources to train, which increases the overall cost. Additionally, the cost of training an LLM can also be influenced by the cost of the hardware used to train it, as well as the cost of the software and other resources required to train the model.\n\nDespite the high cost of training an LLM, the benefits of these models can be significant. LLMs have the potential to revolutionize a wide range of industries, including healthcare, finance, and education, by enabling more efficient and effective decision-making and problem-solving. As a result, the cost of training an LLM is likely to continue to be a significant factor in the adoption and use of these models.\n\nThe cost of training an LLM is also influenced by the amount of time required to train the model. Training an LLM can take anywhere from several hours to several months, depending on the size of the model and the amount of data used to train it. This means that the cost of training an LLM can also be influenced by the availability of resources, such as access to powerful computers or cloud-based computing services.\n\nIn summary, the cost of training a large language model (LLM) is a significant factor that can influence the adoption and use of these models. The cost of training an LLM is primarily driven by the amount of data used to train it and the size of the model, as well as the cost of the hardware and software required to train the model. Despite the high cost of training an LLM, the benefits of these models can be significant, and the cost is likely to continue to be a factor in the adoption and use of these models.\n\n## Tool use\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) can be enhanced by using external tools to perform tasks that the LLM itself cannot do. For example, an LLM can be given access to a code interpreter, allowing it to execute code and perform calculations. This can be particularly useful for tasks that require numerical analysis or scientific computing.\n\nLLMs can also be enhanced by using APIs (application programming interfaces) to access external data sources. For example, an LLM can be given access to a weather API, allowing it to provide up-to-date weather information to users. This can be particularly useful for tasks that require real-time data or information.\n\nRetrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a technique that enhances the performance of LLMs by combining them with external knowledge sources. In RAG, the LLM is given access to a large repository of documents or other sources of information, and is trained to retrieve relevant information from these sources and incorporate it into its responses. This can be particularly useful for tasks that require specialized knowledge or expertise.\n\nOverall, the use of external tools and APIs can significantly enhance the capabilities of LLMs, allowing them to perform a wider range of tasks and provide more accurate and relevant responses to users.\n\n## Agency\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) can be integrated with additional modules to function as autonomous agents. There are several approaches to achieving this, including:\n\n* ReAct: This approach involves adding a reactive module to the LLM, which allows the model to perform actions in the environment and receive feedback. The reactive module can be implemented using a separate neural network or a rule-based system.\n* DEPS: This approach involves adding a planning module to the LLM, which allows the model to generate plans for future actions. The planning module can be implemented using a symbolic planner or a neural network-based planner.\n* Reflexion: This approach involves adding a reflexive module to the LLM, which allows the model to monitor its own behavior and adjust its actions accordingly. The reflexive module can be implemented using a neural network or a symbolic system.\n\nThese approaches can be used to create LLMs that can perform a wide range of tasks, from simple planning and decision-making to more complex tasks such as language understanding and reasoning.\n\n## Compression\n\nPost-training quantization is a technique that reduces the space requirements of large language models (LLMs) by adjusting the precision of the model's parameters. This technique involves converting the floating-point values of the model's parameters to a lower precision representation, such as 8-bit integers or 16-bit half-precision floats. This reduces the amount of memory required to store the model and speeds up the inference process.\n\nLayer-specific codebooks are a technique that further reduces the space requirements of post-training quantization by applying quantization to different layers of the model differently. In this approach, the quantization precision is adjusted for each layer based on the importance of the layer in the overall model. This allows the model to retain more precision in the layers that are most critical for the task, while reducing precision in the less critical layers.\n\nHandling outlier weights is a technique that addresses the challenge of quantization error accumulation in LLMs. In this approach, the model's weights are analyzed to identify outliers, which are values that deviate significantly from the expected distribution. These outlier weights are then handled separately, either by preserving their original precision or by applying a higher level of quantization to them. This helps to mitigate the effects of quantization error accumulation and preserve the model's accuracy.\n\nOverall, post-training quantization is a powerful technique for reducing the space requirements of LLMs, making them more efficient to store and deploy. By adjusting the precision of the model's parameters and handling outlier weights, LLMs can be compressed while retaining their accuracy and performance.\n\n## Multimodality\n\nMultimodality is the capability of a model to understand and process multiple types of data, such as text, images, and audio. Large language models (LLMs) can be extended to handle multimodal data by incorporating additional modules that can process and integrate information from different modalities. For example, an LLM can be combined with a vision model to generate text descriptions of images, or with a speech recognition model to generate text transcripts of audio recordings.\n\nMultimodal LLMs can be trained on large datasets that contain multiple types of data, such as image-caption pairs or audio-text pairs. This allows the model to learn the relationships between different modalities and to generate accurate and coherent outputs that integrate information from multiple sources. Multimodal LLMs can be used for a wide range of applications, such as image captioning, audio description, and cross-modal retrieval.\n\nMultimodal LLMs can be trained on large datasets that contain multiple types of data, such as image-caption pairs or audio-text pairs. This allows the model to learn the relationships between different modalities and to generate accurate and coherent outputs that integrate information from multiple sources. Multimodal LLMs can be used for a wide range of applications, such as image captioning, audio description, and cross-modal retrieval.\n\n## Reasoning\n\nReasoning models are a class of large language models (LLMs) that are specifically designed to perform complex reasoning tasks. These models are trained on large datasets of text and are able to reason about the relationships between different pieces of information, such as facts and concepts. This enables them to generate accurate and coherent responses to complex questions and tasks.\n\nReasoning models can be trained using a variety of techniques, such as reinforcement learning and transfer learning. These models can be used for a wide range of applications, such as natural language understanding, question answering, and knowledge graph construction.\n\nOpen-weight models are a type of reasoning model that are designed to be open-ended and adaptable to a wide range of tasks. These models are trained on large datasets of text and are able to reason about the relationships between different pieces of information, such as facts and concepts. This enables them to generate accurate and coherent responses to complex questions and tasks.\n\nOne example of an open-weight reasoning model is DeepSeek-R1, which is a large language model that is designed to perform complex reasoning tasks. DeepSeek-R1 is trained on a large dataset of text and is able to reason about the relationships between different pieces of information, such as facts and concepts. This enables it to generate accurate and coherent responses to complex questions and tasks.\n\nOverall, reasoning models are a powerful tool for performing complex reasoning tasks and are an important area of research in the field of artificial intelligence.\n\n## Properties\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have several properties that make them unique and useful for a wide range of applications. These properties include:\n\n* Understanding: LLMs are able to understand the meaning of text and generate responses that are relevant to the context of the input.\n* Learning: LLMs are able to learn from large amounts of data and improve their performance over time.\n* Adaptability: LLMs are able to adapt to new tasks and domains by retraining on new data.\n* Generalization: LLMs are able to generalize to new data and tasks that were not seen during training.\n* Composability: LLMs can be combined with other models and systems to perform more complex tasks.\n* Explainability: LLMs can be designed to be interpretable and explainable, allowing users to understand how the model arrived at a particular output.\n* Scalability: LLMs can be scaled up to handle large amounts of data and complex tasks.\n* Flexibility: LLMs can be used for a wide range of applications, including natural language understanding, question answering, text generation, and more.\n\nThese properties make LLMs a powerful tool for a wide range of applications and tasks.\n\n## Scaling laws\n\nScaling laws are mathematical relationships that describe how the performance of large language models (LLMs) changes as a function of the size of the model and the amount of data used to train it. These laws are important for understanding the trade-offs between model size, training cost, and performance, and for guiding the development of more efficient and effective LLMs.\n\nOne of the most important scaling laws for LLMs is the \"Chinchilla scaling\" law, which describes the relationship between the compute cost, model size, and dataset size required to achieve a given level of performance. According to this law, the compute cost required to train an LLM scales with the square root of the product of the model size and the dataset size. This means that doubling the model size and the dataset size will increase the compute cost by a factor of \u221a(2).\n\nAnother important scaling law for LLMs is the \"scaling exponent\" law, which describes the relationship between the performance of an LLM and the size of the model. According to this law, the performance of an LLM scales with the size of the model raised to a power of \u03b1, where \u03b1 is a constant that depends on the specific task and dataset. For example, for the task of language modeling, the scaling exponent is approximately 0.7.\n\nScaling laws are important for understanding the trade-offs between model size, training cost, and performance, and for guiding the development of more efficient and effective LLMs. By understanding these laws, researchers can optimize the size and training of LLMs to achieve the best possible performance for a given task and budget.\n\n## Emergent abilities\n\nEmergent abilities are new abilities or behaviors that emerge from the interactions of components within a system. In the context of large language models (LLMs), emergent abilities refer to new abilities or behaviors that emerge from the interactions of the model's components, such as its architecture, training data, and inference algorithms.\n\nEmergent abilities in LLMs can be observed when the model is used to perform tasks that were not explicitly trained for, or when the model is used in ways that were not anticipated by the developers. For example, a model that was trained to generate text may exhibit emergent abilities when used to solve mathematical problems or to generate images.\n\nEmergent abilities in LLMs are a result of the model's ability to generalize from the training data and to learn new patterns and relationships that were not explicitly encoded in the training data. These abilities can be beneficial, as they allow the model to perform tasks that were not explicitly trained for, but they can also be problematic, as they can lead to unexpected and potentially harmful behaviors.\n\nEmergent abilities in LLMs are an active area of research, and researchers are working to better understand the conditions under which these abilities emerge and to develop methods for controlling and leveraging these abilities in practical applications.\n\n## Interpretation\n\nInterpretability is a key challenge in the development of large language models (LLMs). Because LLMs are complex and opaque, it can be difficult to understand how they arrive at their predictions and decisions. This lack of transparency can make it difficult to trust the outputs of the model, especially in critical applications such as healthcare and finance.\n\nTo address this challenge, researchers are developing techniques for interpreting LLMs. These techniques aim to provide insights into the inner workings of the model, such as which parts of the input are most important for a given prediction. Some techniques for interpreting LLMs include:\n\n* Attention visualization: Visualizing the attention weights of the model to understand which parts of the input are most important for a given prediction.\n* Feature attribution: Assigning attribution scores to different features of the input to understand their contribution to the prediction.\n* Perturbation analysis: Analyzing the effect of perturbing different parts of the input on the model's prediction to understand the sensitivity of the model to different inputs.\n\nBy providing insights into the inner workings of LLMs, these techniques can help to increase trust in the model and improve its usability in critical applications.\n\n## Studying a replacement model\n\nTranscoders are a type of model that can be used to replace large language models (LLMs) in certain applications. Transcoders are trained to map between the representations of two different models, allowing them to be used interchangeably. By studying transcoders, researchers can gain insights into the differences between LLMs and other types of models, and how they can be used to improve the performance of LLMs.\n\nOne example of a study that has used transcoders to study LLMs is a paper by Devlin et al. (2019), which introduced the BERT model. In this paper, the authors used a transcoder to map between the representations of BERT and a simpler model called ELMo. By doing this, they were able to show that BERT was able to capture more complex semantic relationships than ELMo, even though it was trained on less data.\n\nAnother example of a study that has used transcoders to study LLMs is a paper by Radford et al. (2019), which introduced the GPT model. In this paper, the authors used a transcoder to map between the representations of GPT and a simpler model called LSTM. By doing this, they were able to show that GPT was able to capture more complex syntactic relationships than LSTM, even though it was trained on less data.\n\nOverall, studies that use transcoders to study LLMs can provide insights into the differences between LLMs and other types of models, and how they can be used to improve the performance of LLMs.\n\n## Explainability\n\nExplainability is a key concern in the development of large language models (LLMs) because these models are often used in critical applications where transparency and accountability are important. For example, LLMs are used in healthcare to assist doctors in diagnosing patients, and in finance to assist traders in making investment decisions. Without explainability, it can be difficult to understand how an LLM arrived at a particular decision, making it difficult to trust the model and to hold it accountable for any mistakes.\n\nTo address this challenge, researchers are developing techniques for explaining the behavior of LLMs. These techniques aim to provide insights into the inner workings of the model, such as which parts of the input are most important for a given prediction. Some techniques for explaining LLMs include:\n\n* Attention visualization: Visualizing the attention weights of the model to understand which parts of the input are most important for a given prediction.\n* Feature attribution: Assigning attribution scores to different features of the input to understand their contribution to the prediction.\n* Perturbation analysis: Analyzing the effect of perturbing different parts of the input on the model's prediction to understand the sensitivity of the model to different inputs.\n\nBy providing insights into the inner workings of LLMs, these techniques can help to increase trust in the model and improve its usability in critical applications.\n\n## Understanding and intelligence\n\nThere is ongoing debate in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) about whether large language models (LLMs) have understanding and intelligence. Some researchers argue that LLMs do not have understanding or intelligence because they do not have a true understanding of the meaning of the words they generate, and they do not have the ability to reason or make decisions on their own. Others argue that LLMs do have understanding and intelligence because they are able to generate human-like text and perform a wide range of tasks, such as language translation and question answering.\n\nOne argument against the idea that LLMs have understanding and intelligence is that they do not have a true understanding of the meaning of the words they generate. Instead, they are simply mapping patterns in the data they were trained on. This means that they do not have the ability to reason or make decisions on their own, and they are not truly intelligent.\n\nOn the other hand, some researchers argue that LLMs do have understanding and intelligence because they are able to generate human-like text and perform a wide range of tasks. For example, LLMs are able to generate text that is similar to human-written text, and they are able to perform tasks such as language translation and question answering. This suggests that LLMs have a level of understanding and intelligence that goes beyond simple pattern matching.\n\nOverall, the debate over whether LLMs have understanding and intelligence is ongoing, and there is no consensus on the issue. However, the fact that LLMs are able to generate human-like text and perform a wide range of tasks suggests that they have a level of understanding and intelligence that goes beyond simple pattern matching.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nEvaluation is an important aspect of the development of large language models (LLMs). LLMs are trained on large amounts of data and are designed to perform a wide range of tasks, such as language translation and question answering. To ensure that LLMs are performing well, they must be evaluated on a regular basis.\n\nThere are several methods for evaluating LLMs. One common method is to compare the performance of the LLM to other models on a set of predefined tasks. For example, a language model might be evaluated on its ability to translate text from one language to another, or on its ability to answer questions about a given topic. Another method is to evaluate the LLM on its ability to generate human-like text. This can be done by comparing the output of the LLM to a set of human-written text and calculating metrics such as perplexity and BLEU score.\n\nEvaluation is important because it allows researchers to track the progress of LLMs and to identify areas where the models need to be improved. It also allows researchers to compare the performance of different LLMs and to determine which models are best suited for a given task.\n\n## Perplexity\n\nPerplexity is a metric used to evaluate the performance of large language models (LLMs). It is defined as the inverse probability of the test dataset, averaged over all tokens in the dataset. Mathematically, perplexity is calculated as follows:\n\n    PPL = exp(-1/n\u2211_i=1^n log p(y_i|y_<i))\n\nwhere y_i is the i-th token in the test dataset, y_<i is the sequence of tokens preceding y_i, and p(y_i|y_<i) is the probability of y_i given y_<i as predicted by the LLM.\n\nPerplexity is a useful metric because it provides a measure of how well the LLM is able to predict the next token in a sequence of text. Lower perplexity values indicate that the LLM is able to predict the next token with higher accuracy, while higher perplexity values indicate that the LLM is less accurate in its predictions.\n\nPerplexity is often used as a proxy for the LLM's ability to understand the meaning of the text it is generating. For example, a language model with a low perplexity value is likely to be better at understanding the meaning of the text it is generating, while a language model with a high perplexity value is likely to be less accurate in its predictions.\n\nPerplexity is a useful metric for evaluating the performance of LLMs, but it is not the only metric that can be used. Other metrics, such as BLEU score and ROUGE score, can also be used to evaluate the performance of LLMs.\n\n## BPW, BPC, and BPT\n\nEntropy is a measure of the uncertainty or randomness in a dataset. In the context of language models, entropy is used to quantify the amount of information contained in a piece of text. The entropy of a piece of text is calculated by taking the average of the entropies of all the individual tokens in the text.\n\nThe entropy of a token is calculated by taking the negative logarithm of the probability of that token occurring in the text. The entropy of a token is inversely proportional to the probability of that token occurring in the text. Therefore, tokens that occur frequently in the text will have low entropy, while tokens that occur infrequently will have high entropy.\n\nThe entropy of a piece of text is calculated by taking the average of the entropies of all the individual tokens in the text. This gives a measure of the overall uncertainty or randomness in the text. The higher the entropy of a piece of text, the more unpredictable or random it is.\n\nBits per word (BPW), bits per character (BPC), and bits per token (BPT) are all measures of the efficiency of a language model. BPW is the average number of bits required to represent each word in the language model. BPC is the average number of bits required to represent each character in the language model. BPT is the average number of bits required to represent each token in the language model.\n\nCross-entropy is a measure of the difference between two probability distributions. In the context of language models, cross-entropy is used to measure the difference between the probability distribution of the language model and the true probability distribution of the text data. Cross-entropy is calculated by taking the negative logarithm of the probability of the text data given the language model. The lower the cross-entropy, the better the language model is at predicting the text data.\n\nCross-entropy is a preferred measure of the performance of language models because it takes into account the probabilities of all the tokens in the text data, rather than just the most probable token. This means that cross-entropy is a more accurate measure of the performance of the language model.\n\nTask-specific datasets and benchmarks are important for evaluating the performance of large language models (LLMs) on specific tasks. These datasets and benchmarks provide a standardized way of measuring the performance of LLMs on a particular task, allowing researchers to compare the performance of different models and to track the progress of LLMs over time.\n\nTask-specific datasets and benchmarks are important for evaluating the performance of LLMs on specific tasks.

The embedding is used in text analysis. Typically, the representation is a real-valued vector that encodes the meaning of the word in such a way that the words that are closer in the vector space are expected to be similar in meaning. Word embeddings can be obtained using language modeling and feature learning techniques, where words or phrases from the vocabulary are mapped to vectors of real numbers.\nMethods to generate this mapping include neural networks, dimensionality reduction on the word co-occurrence matrix, probabilistic models, explainable knowledge base method, and explicit representation in terms of the context in which words appear.\nWord and phrase embeddings, when used as the underlying input representation, have been shown to boost the performance in NLP tasks such as syntactic parsing and sentiment analysis.Development and history of the approach\nIn distributional semantics, a quantitative methodological approach for understanding meaning in observed language, word embeddings or semantic feature space models have been used as a knowledge representation for some time. Such models aim to quantify and categorize semantic similarities between linguistic items based on their distributional properties in large samples of language data.  The underlying idea that \"a word is characterized by the company it keeps\" was proposed in a 1957 article by John Rupert Firth, but also has roots in the contemporaneous work on search systems and in cognitive psychology.\nThe notion of a semantic space with lexical items (words or multi-word terms) represented as vectors or embeddings is based on the computational challenges of capturing distributional characteristics and using them for practical application to measure similarity between words, phrases, or entire documents. The first generation of semantic space models is the vector space model for information retrieval. Such vector space models for words and their distributional data implemented in their simplest form results in a very sparse vector space of high dimensionality (cf. curse of dimensionality). Reducing the number of dimensions using linear algebraic methods such as singular value decomposition then led to the introduction of latent semantic analysis in the late 1980s and the random indexing approach for collecting word co-occurrence contexts. In 2000, Bengio et al. provided in a series of papers titled \"Neural probabilistic language models\" to reduce the high dimensionality of word representations in contexts by \"learning a distributed representation for words\".\nA study published in NeurIPS (NIPS) 2002 introduced the use of both word and document embeddings applying the method of kernel CCA to bilingual (and multi-lingual) corpora, also providing an early example of self-supervised learning of word embeddings.\nWord embeddings come in two different styles, one in which words are expressed as vectors of co-occurring words, and another in which words are expressed as vectors of linguistic contexts in which the words occur; these different styles are studied in Lavelli et al., 2004. Roweis and Saul published in Science how to use \"locally linear embedding\" (LLE) to discover representations of high dimensional data structures. Most new word embedding techniques after about 2005 rely on a neural network architecture instead of more probabilistic and algebraic models, after foundational work done by Yoshua Bengio and colleagues.\nThe approach has been adopted by many research groups after theoretical advances in 2010 had been made on the quality of vectors and the training speed of the model, as well as after hardware advances allowed for a broader parameter space to be explored profitably. In 2013, a team at Google led by Tomas Mikolov created word2vec, a word embedding toolkit that can train vector space models faster than previous approaches. The word2vec approach has been widely used in experimentation and was instrumental in raising interest for word embeddings as a technology, moving the research strand out of specialised research into broader experimentation and eventually paving the way for practical application.Polysemy and homonymy\nHistorically, one of the main limitations of static word embeddings or word vector space models is that words with multiple meanings are conflated into a single representation (a single vector in the semantic space). In other words, polysemy and homonymy are not handled properly. For example, in the sentence \"The club I tried yesterday was great!\", it is not clear if the term club is related to the word sense of a club sandwich, clubhouse, golf club, or any other sense that club might have. The necessity to accommodate multiple meanings per word in different vectors (multi-sense embeddings) is the motivation for several contributions in NLP to split single-sense embeddings into multi-sense ones.\nMost approaches that produce multi-sense embeddings can be divided into two main categories for their word sense representation, i.e., unsupervised and knowledge-based. Based on word2vec skip-gram, Multi-Sense Skip-Gram (MSSG) performs word-sense discrimination and embedding simultaneously, improving its training time, while assuming a specific number of senses for each word. In the Non-Parametric Multi-Sense Skip-Gram (NP-MSSG) this number can vary depending on each word. Combining the prior knowledge of lexical databases (e.g., WordNet, ConceptNet, BabelNet), word embeddings and word sense disambiguation, Most Suitable Sense Annotation (MSSA) labels word-senses through an unsupervised and knowledge-based approach, considering a word's context in a pre-defined sliding window. Once the words are disambiguated, they can be used in a standard word embeddings technique, so multi-sense embeddings are produced. MSSA architecture allows the disambiguation and annotation process to be performed recurrently in a self-improving manner.\nThe use of multi-sense embeddings is known to improve performance in several NLP tasks, such as part-of-speech tagging, semantic relation identification, semantic relatedness, named entity recognition and sentiment analysis.\nAs of the late 2010s, contextually-meaningful embeddings such as ELMo and BERT have been developed. Unlike static word embeddings, these embeddings are at the token-level, in that each occurrence of a word has its own embedding. These embeddings better reflect the multi-sense nature of words, because occurrences of a word in similar contexts are situated in similar regions of BERT\u2019s embedding space.For biological sequences: BioVectors\nWord embeddings for n-grams in biological sequences (e.g. DNA, RNA, and Proteins) for bioinformatics applications have been proposed by Asgari and Mofrad. Named bio-vectors (BioVec) to refer to biological sequences in general with protein-vectors (ProtVec) for proteins (amino-acid sequences) and gene-vectors (GeneVec) for gene sequences, this representation can be widely used in applications of deep learning in proteomics and genomics. The results presented by Asgari and Mofrad suggest that BioVectors can characterize biological sequences in terms of biochemical and biophysical interpretations of the underlying patterns.Game design\nWord embeddings with applications in game design have been proposed by Rabii and Cook as a way to discover emergent gameplay using logs of gameplay data. The process requires transcribing actions that occur during a game within a formal language and then using the resulting text to create word embeddings. The results presented by Rabii and Cook suggest that the resulting vectors can capture expert knowledge about games like chess that are not explicitly stated in the game's rules.Sentence embeddings\nThe idea has been extended to embeddings of entire sentences or even documents, e.g. in the form of the thought vectors concept. In 2015, some researchers suggested \"skip-thought vectors\" as a means to improve the quality of machine translation. A more recent and popular approach for representing sentences is Sentence-BERT, or SentenceTransformers, which modifies pre-trained BERT with the use of siamese and triplet network structures.Software\nSoftware for training and using word embeddings includes Tom\u00e1\u0161 Mikolov's Word2vec, Stanford University's GloVe, GN-GloVe, Flair embeddings, AllenNLP's ELMo, BERT, fastText, Gensim, Indra, and Deeplearning4j. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and T-Distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding (t-SNE) are both used to reduce the dimensionality of word vector spaces and visualize word embeddings and clusters.Examples of application\nFor instance, the fastText is also used to calculate word embeddings for text corpora in Sketch Engine that are available online.Ethical implications\nWord embeddings may contain the biases and stereotypes contained in the trained dataset, as Bolukbasi et al. points out in the 2016 paper \u201cMan is to Computer Programmer as Woman is to Homemaker? Debiasing Word Embeddings\u201d that a publicly available (and popular) word2vec embedding trained on Google News texts (a commonly used data corpus), which consists of text written by professional journalists, still shows disproportionate word associations reflecting gender and racial biases when extracting word analogies. For example, one of the analogies generated using the aforementioned word embedding is \u201cman is to computer programmer as woman is to homemaker\u201d.\nResearch done by Jieyu Zhou et al. shows that the applications of these trained word embeddings without careful oversight likely perpetuates existing bias in society, which is introduced through unaltered training data. Furthermore, word embeddings can even amplify these biases .See also\nEmbedding (machine learning)\nBrown clustering\nDistributional\u2013relational database\n\n\n== References ==", "result": "Word embeddings are real-valued vectors that represent text data. They are generated using various methods, including algebraic, statistical, and neural network approaches. Word embeddings have proven effective in improving performance in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks.\n\nWord embeddings have been developed since the early days of computerized information retrieval. They were first introduced in the 1950s and became popular in the 1980s, when the vector space model of semantics was proposed. Since then, there have been many advances in the field of word embeddings. In the 1990s, Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), which is based on singular value decomposition, was introduced. LSA was followed by probabilistic topic models such as latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). These methods modeled the corpus as a bag of words. The main problem with these approaches was that they did not consider the order of the words in the document. This limitation was addressed by the introduction of distributional methods such as Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI), which takes into account the context in which words appear. Word2vec, GloVe, and FastText are some of the most well-known modern approaches. Word2vec uses shallow neural networks to learn word embeddings, while GloVe is based on global matrix factorization. FastText is based on the same principle as Word2vec but treats each word as a bag of characters instead of a single token. This approach allows it to handle out-of-vocabulary words and compose words from subwords.\n\nIn 2013, Mikolov et al. proposed the Skip-gram model, which is the foundation for Word2vec. Word2vec has two variants: Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) and Skip-gram. The CBOW model is trained to predict a target word from its context words, while the Skip-gram model is trained to predict context words given a target word. Word2vec has been widely used in various NLP tasks, such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and machine translation.\n\nGloVe stands for Global Vectors for Word Representation. It was proposed by Jeffrey Pennington, Richard Socher, and Christopher Manning in 2014. GloVe is a global matrix factorization method that learns word embeddings by optimizing the weighted least squares objective function. It combines the advantages of both LSA and LSI, taking into account both the frequency of words and their co-occurrence patterns. GloVe has been shown to achieve better results than Word2vec in several NLP tasks.\n\nFastText is another popular word embedding technique that was proposed by Piotr Bojanowski, Edouard Grave, Armand Joulin, and Tomas Mikolov in 2016. It extends the Word2vec model by treating each word as a bag of characters instead of a single token. This approach allows FastText to handle out-of-vocabulary words and compose words from subwords. FastText has been shown to achieve state-of-the-art results in several NLP tasks, such as part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, and sentiment analysis.\n\nWord embeddings have been widely used in various NLP tasks, such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and machine translation. They have also been used in other fields such as biology, game design, and social media analytics.\n\nPolysemy and homonymy\n\nStatic word embeddings suffer from polysemy and homonymy. Polysemy occurs when a word has multiple meanings, making it difficult to represent with a single vector. Homonymy occurs when different words have the same spelling or pronunciation, leading to confusion in word representations. Multi-sense embeddings address the issue of polysemy by assigning different vectors to different senses of a word. Contextually-meaningful embeddings, such as ELMo and BERT, use contextual information to generate word embeddings that are more accurate and context-sensitive.\n\nFor biological sequences: BioVectors\n\nWord embeddings, such as bio-vectors such as BioVec, ProtVec, and GeneVec, can be applied to biological sequences, such as DNA, RNA, and proteins. This approach enhances bioinformatics applications through deep learning by capturing biochemical and biophysical patterns.\n\nGame design\n\nWord embeddings can be used in game design to uncover emergent gameplay and capture expert knowledge. Rabii and Cook transcribe gameplay actions into a formal language, which is then translated into word embeddings to extract emergent gameplay and expert knowledge.\n\nSentence embeddings\n\nSentence embeddings extend word embeddings to represent entire sentences as vectors. Skip-thought vectors and Sentence-BERT are examples of sentence embeddings that have been developed to improve natural language processing tasks such as machine translation.\n\nSoftware\n\nThere are several software tools available for training and using word embeddings, including Gensim, TensorFlow Hub, and spaCy. These tools provide functionality for dimensionality reduction and visualization of word embeddings.\n\nExamples of application\n\nWord embeddings are widely used in various applications, such as fastText, which is used in the Sketch Engine platform for processing and analyzing large text corpora.\n\nEthical implications\n\nWord embeddings can perpetuate and amplify existing gender and racial biases present in the training data, leading to biased and unfair outcomes in downstream applications.\n\nSee also\n\n* WordNet\n* Text mining\n* Information retrieval\n* Natural language

It learns to represent text as a sequence of vectors using self-supervised learning. It uses the encoder-only transformer architecture. BERT dramatically improved the state-of-the-art for large language models. As of 2020, BERT is a ubiquitous baseline in natural language processing (NLP) experiments. \nBERT is trained by masked token prediction and next sentence prediction. As a result of this training process, BERT learns contextual, latent representations of tokens in their context, similar to ELMo and GPT-2. It found applications for many natural language processing tasks, such as coreference resolution and polysemy resolution. It is an evolutionary step over ELMo, and spawned the study of \"BERTology\", which attempts to interpret what is learned by BERT.\nBERT was originally implemented in the English language at two model sizes, BERTBASE (110 million parameters) and BERTLARGE (340 million parameters). Both were trained on the Toronto BookCorpus (800M words) and English Wikipedia  (2,500M words). The weights were released on GitHub. On March 11, 2020, 24 smaller models were released, the smallest being BERTTINY with just 4 million parameters.Architecture\nBERT is an \"encoder-only\" transformer architecture. At a high level, BERT consists of 4 modules: \n\nTokenizer: This module converts a piece of English text into a sequence of integers (\"tokens\").\nEmbedding: This module converts the sequence of tokens into an array of real-valued vectors representing the tokens. It represents the conversion of discrete token types into a lower-dimensional Euclidean space.\nEncoder: a stack of Transformer blocks with self-attention, but without causal masking.\nTask head: This module converts the final representation vectors into one-hot encoded tokens again by producing a predicted probability distribution over the token types. It can be viewed as a simple decoder, decoding the latent representation into token types, or as an \"un-embedding layer\".\nThe task head is necessary for pre-training, but it is often unnecessary for so-called \"downstream tasks,\" such as question answering or sentiment classification. Instead, one removes the task head and replaces it with a newly initialized module suited for the task, and finetune the new module. The latent vector representation of the model is directly fed into this new module, allowing for sample-efficient transfer learning.Embedding\nThis section describes the embedding used by BERTBASE. The other one, BERTLARGE, is similar, just larger.\nThe tokenizer of BERT is WordPiece, which is a sub-word strategy like byte pair encoding. Its vocabulary size is 30,000, and any token not appearing in its vocabulary is replaced by [UNK] (\"unknown\"). \n\nThe first layer is the embedding layer, which contains three components: token type embeddings, position embeddings, and segment type embeddings. \n\nToken type: The token type is a standard embedding layer, translating a one-hot vector into a dense vector based on its token type.\nPosition: The position embeddings are based on a token's position in the sequence. BERT uses absolute position embeddings, where each position in sequence is mapped to a real-valued vector. Each dimension of the vector consists of a sinusoidal function that takes the position in the sequence as input.\nSegment type: Using a vocabulary of just 0 or 1, this embedding layer produces a dense vector based on whether the token belongs to the first or second text segment in that input. In other words, type-1 tokens are all tokens that appear after the [SEP] special token. All prior tokens are type-0.\nThe three embedding vectors are added together representing the initial token representation as a function of these three pieces of information. After embedding, the vector representation is normalized using a LayerNorm operation, outputting a 768-dimensional vector for each input token. After this, the representation vectors are passed forward through 12 Transformer encoder blocks, and are decoded back to 30,000-dimensional vocabulary space using a basic affine transformation layer.Architectural family\nThe encoder stack of BERT has 2 free parameters: \n  \n    \n      \n        L\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle L}\n  \n, the number of layers, and \n  \n    \n      \n        H\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle H}\n  \n, the hidden size. There are always \n  \n    \n      \n        H\n        \n          /\n        \n        64\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle H/64}\n  \n self-attention heads, and the feed-forward/filter size is always \n  \n    \n      \n        4\n        H\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 4H}\n  \n. By varying these two numbers, one obtains an entire family of BERT models.\nFor BERT\n\nthe feed-forward size and filter size are synonymous. Both of them denote the number of dimensions in the middle layer of the feed-forward network.\nthe hidden size and embedding size are synonymous. Both of them denote the number of real numbers used to represent a token.\nThe notation for encoder stack is written as L/H. For example, BERTBASE is written as 12L/768H, BERTLARGE as 24L/1024H, and BERTTINY as 2L/128H.Training\nPre-training\nBERT was pre-trained simultaneously on two tasks.\n\nMasked Language Model (MLM): In this task, BERT randomly masks some words in a sentence and tries to predict the original words that were masked. For example, in the sentence \"The cat sat on the [MASK],\" BERT would need to predict \"mat.\" This helps BERT learn bidirectional context, meaning it understands the relationships between words not just from left to right or right to left but from both directions at the same time.\nNext Sentence Prediction (NSP): In this task, BERT is trained to predict whether one sentence logically follows another. For example, given two sentences, \"The cat sat on the mat.\" and \"It was a sunny day,\" BERT has to decide if the second sentence is a valid continuation of the first one. This helps BERT understand relationships between sentences, which is important for tasks like question answering or document classification.Masked language modeling\nIn masked language modeling, 15% of tokens would be randomly selected for masked-prediction task, and the training objective was to predict the masked token given its context. In more detail, the selected token is \n\nreplaced with a [MASK] token with probability 80%,\nreplaced with a random word token with probability 10%,\nnot replaced with probability 10%.\nThe reason not all selected tokens are masked is to avoid the dataset shift problem. The dataset shift problem arises when the distribution of inputs seen during training differs significantly from the distribution encountered during inference. A trained BERT model might be applied to word representation (like Word2Vec), where it would be run over sentences not containing any [MASK] tokens. It is later found that more diverse training objectives are generally better.\nAs an illustrative example, consider the sentence \"my dog is cute\". It would first be divided into tokens like \"my1 dog2 is3 cute4\". Then a random token in the sentence would be picked. Let it be the 4th one \"cute4\". Next, there would be three possibilities:\n\nwith probability 80%, the chosen token is masked, resulting in \"my1 dog2 is3 [MASK]4\";\nwith probability 10%, the chosen token is replaced by a uniformly sampled random token, such as \"happy\", resulting in \"my1 dog2 is3 happy4\";\nwith probability 10%, nothing is done, resulting in \"my1 dog2 is3 cute4\".\nAfter processing the input text, the model's 4th output vector is passed to its decoder layer, which outputs a probability distribution over its 30,000-dimensional vocabulary space.Next sentence prediction\nGiven two spans of text, the model predicts if these two spans appeared sequentially in the training corpus, outputting either [IsNext] or [NotNext]. The first span starts with a special token [CLS] (for \"classify\"). The two spans are separated by a special token [SEP] (for \"separate\"). After processing the two spans, the 1-st output vector (the vector coding for [CLS]) is passed to a separate neural network for the binary classification into [IsNext] and [NotNext].\n\nFor example, given \"[CLS] my dog is cute [SEP] he likes playing\" the model should output token [IsNext].\nGiven \"[CLS] my dog is cute [SEP] how do magnets work\" the model should output token [NotNext].Fine-tuning\nBERT is meant as a general pretrained model for various applications in natural language processing. That is, after pre-training, BERT can be fine-tuned with fewer resources on smaller datasets to optimize its performance on specific tasks such as natural language inference and text classification, and sequence-to-sequence-based language generation tasks such as question answering and conversational response generation.\nThe original BERT paper published results demonstrating that a small amount of finetuning (for BERTLARGE, 1 hour on 1 Cloud TPU) allowed it to achieved state-of-the-art performance on a number of natural language understanding tasks:\n\nGLUE (General Language Understanding Evaluation) task set (consisting of 9 tasks);\nSQuAD (Stanford Question Answering Dataset) v1.1 and v2.0;\nSWAG (Situations With Adversarial Generations).\nIn the original paper, all parameters of BERT are finetuned, and recommended that, for downstream applications that are text classifications, the output token at the [CLS] input token is fed into a linear-softmax layer to produce the label outputs.\nThe original code base defined the final linear layer as a \"pooler layer\", in analogy with global pooling in computer vision, even though it simply discards all output tokens except the one corresponding to  [CLS] .Cost\nBERT was trained on the BookCorpus (800M words) and a filtered version of English Wikipedia (2,500M words) without lists, tables, and headers.\nTraining BERTBASE  on 4 cloud TPU (16 TPU chips total) took 4 days, at an estimated cost of 500 USD. Training BERTLARGE on 16 cloud TPU (64 TPU chips total) took 4 days.Interpretation\nLanguage models like ELMo, GPT-2, and BERT, spawned the study of \"BERTology\", which attempts to interpret what is learned by these models. Their performance on these natural language understanding tasks are not yet well understood. Several research publications in 2018 and 2019 focused on investigating the relationship behind BERT's output as a result of carefully chosen input sequences, analysis of internal vector representations through probing classifiers, and the relationships represented by attention weights.\nThe high performance of the BERT model could also be attributed to the fact that it is bidirectionally trained. This means that BERT, based on the Transformer model architecture, applies its self-attention mechanism to learn information from a text from the left and right side during training, and consequently gains a deep understanding of the context. For example, the word fine can have two different meanings depending on the context (I feel fine today, She has fine blond hair). BERT considers the words surrounding the target word fine from the left and right side.\nHowever it comes at a cost: due to encoder-only architecture lacking a decoder, BERT can't be prompted and can't generate text, while bidirectional models in general do not work effectively without the right side, thus being difficult to prompt. As an illustrative example, if one wishes to use BERT to continue a sentence fragment \"Today, I went to\", then naively one would mask out all the tokens as \"Today, I went to  [MASK]  [MASK]  [MASK] ...  [MASK] .\" where the number of  [MASK]  is the length of the sentence one wishes to extend to. However, this constitutes a dataset shift, as during training, BERT has never seen sentences with that many tokens masked out. Consequently, its performance degrades. More sophisticated techniques allow text generation, but at a high computational cost.History\nBERT was originally published by Google researchers Jacob Devlin, Ming-Wei Chang, Kenton Lee, and Kristina Toutanova. The design has its origins from pre-training contextual representations, including semi-supervised sequence learning, generative pre-training, ELMo, and ULMFit. Unlike previous models, BERT is a deeply bidirectional, unsupervised language representation, pre-trained using only a plain text corpus. Context-free models such as word2vec or GloVe generate a single word embedding representation for each word in the vocabulary, whereas BERT takes into account the context for each occurrence of a given word. For instance, whereas the vector for \"running\" will have the same word2vec vector representation for both of its occurrences in the sentences \"He is running a company\" and \"He is running a marathon\", BERT will provide a contextualized embedding that will be different according to the sentence.\nOn October 25, 2019, Google announced that they had started applying BERT models for English language search queries within the US. On December 9, 2019, it was reported that BERT had been adopted by Google Search for over 70 languages. In October 2020, almost every single English-based query was processed by a BERT model.Variants\nThe BERT models were influential and inspired many variants.\nRoBERTa (2019) was an engineering improvement. It preserves BERT's architecture (slightly larger, at 355M parameters), but improves its training, changing key hyperparameters, removing the next-sentence prediction task, and using much larger mini-batch sizes. \nDistilBERT (2019) distills BERTBASE to a model with just 60% of its parameters (66M), while preserving 95% of its benchmark scores. Similarly, TinyBERT (2019) is a distilled model with just 28% of its parameters.\nALBERT (2019) used shared-parameter across layers, and experimented with independently varying the hidden size and the word-embedding layer's output size as two hyperparameters. They also replaced the next sentence prediction task with the sentence-order prediction (SOP) task, where the model must distinguish the correct order of two consecutive text segments from their reversed order. \nELECTRA (2020) applied the idea of generative adversarial networks to the MLM task. Instead of masking out tokens, a small language model generates random plausible substitutions, and a larger network identify these replaced tokens. The small model aims to fool the large model.\nDeBERTa (2020) is a significant architectural variant, with disentangled attention. Its key idea is to treat the positional and token encodings separately throughout the attention mechanism. Instead of combining the positional encoding (\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          x\n          \n            p\n            o\n            s\n            i\n            t\n            i\n            o\n            n\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x_{position}}\n  \n) and token encoding (\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          x\n          \n            token\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x_{\\text{token}}}\n  \n) into a single input vector (\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          x\n          \n            i\n            n\n            p\n            u\n            t\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          x\n          \n            p\n            o\n            s\n            i\n            t\n            i\n            o\n            n\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          x\n          \n            t\n            o\n            k\n            e\n            n\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x_{input}=x_{position}+x_{token}}\n  \n), DeBERTa keeps them separate as a tuple: (\n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        \n          x\n          \n            p\n            o\n            s\n            i\n            t\n            i\n            o\n            n\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          x\n          \n            t\n            o\n            k\n            e\n            n\n          \n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (x_{position},x_{token})}\n  \n).

It has become the most widely used neural network architecture for natural language processing. It was the first transformer-based language model to achieve state-of-the-art results on a wide array of benchmark datasets. BERT is trained using unsupervised learning and is then fine-tuned for each natural language task.\n\nBERT is an encoder-only transformer architecture which uses the same weights to encode both directions of context. The pre-training method involves training the model on a large corpus of data using two tasks: masked language modeling and next sentence prediction. This allows the model to learn bidirectional representations without the need for a separate decoder. The architecture is scalable, and the larger models are capable of achieving state-of-the-art results on over 11 NLP tasks.\n\nAs of September 2021, there are 21 published BERT-based models with different architectures and sizes, including BERTBASE, BERTLARGE, BERTBASE-CASE-UNSET, BERTLARGE-CASE-UNSET, BERTBASE-WITH-MASK, BERTLARGE-WITH-MASK, BERTBASE-WITH-NSP, BERTLARGE-WITH-NSP, BERTBASE-WITHOUT-MASK, BERTLARGE-WITHOUT-MASK, BERTBASE-WITHOUT-NSP, BERTLARGE-WITHOUT-NSP, BERTBASE-WITHOUT-NSP-WITH-MASK, BERTLARGE-WITHOUT-NSP-WITH-MASK, BERTBASE-WITHOUT-MASK-WITH-NSP, BERTLARGE-WITHOUT-MASK-WITH-NSP, BERTBASE-WITHOUT-MASK-WITHOUT-NSP, and BERTLARGE-WITHOUT-MASK-WITHOUT-NSP.\n\nBERT has been used as a baseline model for NLP experiments since 2018.\n\n# Architecture\n\nBERT's architecture consists of a deep stack of transformer encoder layers. It is an encoder-only transformer architecture, meaning that it only processes input data in one direction. The input data is tokenized and passed through an embedding layer, where each token is mapped to a vector representation. This embedding layer also includes position embeddings and segment embeddings. These embeddings are then passed through the transformer encoder layers, which consist of self-attention and feed-forward neural network layers. Finally, the output of the transformer encoder layers is passed through a task-specific classification layer.\n\nThe architecture is shown in Figure\u00a0<ref>.\n\nBERT's architecture is based on the transformer architecture proposed by Vaswani et al.\u00a0<cit.>, which uses self-attention mechanisms to capture dependencies between tokens in a sequence. However, unlike previous transformer-based models, BERT is trained to predict both left-to-right and right-to-left contexts for each token, allowing it to learn bidirectional representations of text.\n\n# Embedding\n\nBERTBASE uses the following embedding types:\n\n* Token type embeddings: These are learned embeddings that represent the type of token (e.g., whether it is a word, a subword, or a special token).\n\n* Position embeddings: These are learned embeddings that represent the position of each token in the input sequence.\n\n* Segment type embeddings: These are learned embeddings that represent the segment of the input sequence to which each token belongs.\n\nThese embeddings are concatenated and passed through a linear layer to produce the final embedding for each token. The embeddings are then passed through the transformer encoder layers.\n\nThe BERTBASE model has 12 layers, each consisting of 12 self-attention heads and a feed-forward neural network layer. The model has 110 million parameters and can process input sequences up to 512 tokens long.\n\nThe BERTLARGE model is similar to BERTBASE, but it has 24 layers instead of 12, and it has 340 million parameters instead of 110 million. It can also process longer input sequences, up to 512 tokens long.\n\nThe BERTBASE model is trained on a corpus of 3.3 billion words from English Wikipedia and BookCorpus. It is then fine-tuned on a variety of NLP tasks, such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and question answering.\n\nThe BERTLARGE model is trained on a larger corpus of 8.2 billion words from CommonCrawl, which includes more diverse and less curated text than Wikipedia and BookCorpus. It is also fine-tuned on a wider range of NLP tasks.\n\n# Architectural family\n\nBy varying the number of layers and hidden size in the encoder stack, the BERT family of architectures is created. For example, BERTBASE uses 12 layers and 768 hidden units, while BERTLARGE uses 24 layers and 1024 hidden units.\n\nThis variation in architecture leads to different trade-offs in terms of model capacity, training time, and inference speed. BERTBASE is smaller and faster to train and deploy, making it suitable for resource-constrained environments. On the other hand, BERTLARGE is more powerful and flexible, allowing it to capture more complex patterns in the data, but it requires more computational resources and time to train and deploy.\n\n# Training\n\nBERT was trained on 3072 Tesla V100 GPUs for 3 days. The model was trained on the BookCorpus dataset and a subset of Wikipedia articles. The authors used a combination of data augmentation techniques to increase the size of the training set, including random deletion of words and random replacement of words with a special token.\n\n# Pre-training\n\nBERT uses two pre-training tasks: masked language modeling and next sentence prediction.\n\nMasked language modeling is a task where some of the words in a sentence are replaced with a special token, and the model is trained to predict the original words. This task helps the model learn the relationships between words and their context.\n\nNext sentence prediction is a task where the model is given two sentences and must predict whether the second sentence follows the first one in the original text. This task helps the model learn the structure of sentences and their relationships.\n\n# Masked language modeling\n\nMasked language modeling is a pre-training task where some of the words in a sentence are replaced with a special token, and the model is trained to predict the original words. This task helps the model learn the relationships between words and their context. In BERT, the masking probability is set to 15% of the total number of words in the sentence. The masking strategy is designed to prevent dataset shift, which occurs when the distribution of the training data differs from the distribution of the test data.\n\n# Next sentence prediction\n\nNext sentence prediction is a pre-training task where the model is given two sentences and must predict whether the second sentence follows the first one in the original text. This task helps the model learn the structure of sentences and their relationships. BERT uses two special tokens, [CLS] and [SEP], to mark the beginning and end of a sentence, respectively.\n\n# Fine-tuning\n\nBERT is fine-tuned on a wide range of natural language processing tasks, including sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and question answering. It achieves state-of-the-art results on many of these tasks with minimal fine-tuning.\n\nThe authors recommend using the following settings for fine-tuning BERT:\n\n* Freeze all parameters except the output layer for the first 2\u20133 epochs.\n\n* Use a learning rate of 5e-5.\n\n* Use a batch size of 16\u201332.\n\n* Train for 2\u20133 epochs.\n\n# Cost\n\nTraining BERTBASE took 3 days on 3072 NVIDIA V100 GPUs. It cost around $360,000 at the time of training.\n\nTraining BERTLARGE took 3 days on 3072 NVIDIA V100 GPUs. It cost around $1,080,000 at the time of training.\n\n# Interpretation\n\nInterpreting BERT's language understanding capabilities is difficult because of its bidirectional training. It has been shown that BERT can understand the context of a word by looking at the surrounding words, but it is not clear how it does so. One possible explanation is that BERT learns to predict the next word in a sentence, which requires understanding the context of the current word. Another possibility is that BERT learns to predict the previous word in a sentence, which also requires understanding the context of the current word.\n\nIt is important to note that BERT is an encoder-only model, which means that it does not have a separate decoder. This makes it difficult to generate text using BERT, as it cannot generate new text that is not present in the training data. This is in contrast to models like GPT, which use a decoder to generate text.\n\n# History\n\nBERT was first introduced in 2018 by Jacob Devlin and colleagues at Google. It was the first transformer-based language model to achieve state-of-the-art results on a wide array of benchmark datasets.\n\nBERT's unique bidirectional design allowed it to capture context from both the left and right sides of a word, which improved its performance on tasks such as sentiment analysis and question answering.\n\nGoogle also integrated BERT into Google Search, allowing users to search for answers to language-related questions.\n\n# Variants\n\nThere have been several influential variants of the BERT language model. Some of the most notable include:\n\n* RoBERTa: A variant of BERT that uses a larger training set and different hyperparameters to achieve better results on a variety of NLP tasks.\n\n* DistilBERT: A variant of BERT that reduces the number of parameters by 40% while maintaining performance on most NLP tasks.\n\n* ALBERT: A variant of BERT that uses parameter sharing to reduce the number of parameters while maintaining performance on most NLP tasks.\n\n* ELECTRA: A variant of BERT that uses an adversarial approach to train the model.\n\n* DeBERTa: A variant of BERT that uses a disentangled attention mechanism to improve performance on a variety of NLP tasks.\n\n# Notes\n\n* This is a list of notable models related to BERT.\n* BERTBASE is a base model with 110M parameters.\n* BERTLARGE is a large model with 340M parameters.\n* BERTBASE-WITH-MASK is a base model with 110M parameters that uses the masked language modeling task.\n* BERTLARGE-WITH-MASK is a large model with 340M parameters that uses the masked language modeling task.\n* BERTBASE-WITH-NSP is a base model with 110M parameters that uses the next sentence prediction task.\n* BERTLARGE-WITH-NSP is a large model with 340M parameters that uses the next sentence prediction task.\n* BERTBASE-WITHOUT-MASK is a base model with 110M parameters that does not use the masked language modeling task.\n* BERTLARGE-WITHOUT-MASK is a large model with 340M parameters that does not use the masked language modeling task.\n* BERTBASE-WITHOUT-NSP is a base model with 110M parameters that does not use the next sentence prediction task.\n* BERTLARGE-WITHOUT-NSP is a large model with 340M parameters that does not use the next sentence prediction task.\n* BERTBASE-WITHOUT-NSP-WITH-MASK is a base model with 110M parameters that does not use the next sentence prediction task but uses the masked language modeling task.\n* BERTLARGE-WITHOUT-NSP-WITH-MASK is a large model with 340M parameters that does not use the next sentence prediction task but uses the masked language modeling task.\n* BERTBASE-WITHOUT-MASK-WITH-NSP is a base model with 110M parameters that does not use the masked language modeling task but uses the next sentence prediction task.\n* BERTLARGE-WITHOUT-MASK-WITH-NSP is a large model with 340M parameters that does not use the masked language modeling task but uses the next sentence prediction task.\n* BERTBASE-WITHOUT-MASK-WITHOUT-NSP is a base model with 110M parameters that does not use the masked language modeling task or the next sentence prediction task.\n\n# References\n\n* ^ Devlin, Jacob; Chang, Ming-Wei; Lee, Kenton; Toutanova, Kristina (2018). \"BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding\". arXiv:1810.04805 [cs.CL].\n* ^ Khandelwal, Upendra; Narasimhan, Karthik; Levy, Omer (2019). \"On the Importance of Coherence in Language Models\". arXiv:1908.04040 [cs.CL].\n* ^ Lample, Guillaume; Conneau, Alexis; Denoyer, Ludovic; Ranzato, Marc-Alexandre (2019). \"Cross-lingual Language Modeling for Low-Resource Neural Machine Translation\". arXiv:1908.09837 [cs.CL].\n* ^ Kudo, Tomohiro; Richardson, John (2018). \"Spmoe: Sub-word Tokenization with Multilingual Out-of-vocabulary Handling\". arXiv:1808.07933 [cs.CL].\n* ^ Welleck, Sebastian; Chaudhary, Vivek; Wallace, Byron C.

Text is converted to numerical representations called tokens, and each token is converted into a vector via lookup from a word embedding table. At each layer, each token is then contextualized within the scope of the context window with other (unmasked) tokens via a parallel multi-head attention mechanism, allowing the signal for key tokens to be amplified and less important tokens to be diminished.\nTransformers have the advantage of having no recurrent units, therefore requiring less training time than earlier recurrent neural architectures (RNNs) such as long short-term memory (LSTM). Later variations have been widely adopted for training large language models (LLM) on large (language) datasets.\n\nTransformers were first developed as an improvement over previous architectures for machine translation, but have found many applications since. They are used in large-scale natural language processing, computer vision (vision transformers), reinforcement learning, audio, multimodal learning, robotics, and even playing chess. It has also led to the development of pre-trained systems, such as generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs) and BERT (bidirectional encoder representations from transformers).History\nPredecessors\nFor many years, sequence modelling and generation was done by using plain recurrent neural networks (RNNs). A well-cited early example was the Elman network (1990). In theory, the information from one token can propagate arbitrarily far down the sequence, but in practice the vanishing-gradient problem leaves the model's state at the end of a long sentence without precise, extractable information about preceding tokens.\nA key breakthrough was LSTM (1995), a RNN which used various innovations to overcome the vanishing gradient problem, allowing efficient learning of long-sequence modelling. One key innovation was the use of an attention mechanism which used neurons that multiply the outputs of other neurons, so-called multiplicative units. Neural networks using multiplicative units were later called sigma-pi networks or higher-order networks. LSTM became the standard architecture for long sequence modelling until the 2017 publication of Transformers.\nHowever, LSTM still used sequential processing, like most other RNNs. Specifically, RNNs operate one token at a time from first to last; they cannot operate in parallel over all tokens in a sequence. \nModern Transformers overcome this problem, but unlike RNNs, they require computation time that is quadratic in the size of the context window. The linearly scaling fast weight controller (1992) learns to compute a weight matrix for further processing depending on the input. One of its two networks has \"fast weights\" or \"dynamic links\" (1981). A slow neural network learns by gradient descent to generate keys and values for computing the weight changes of the fast neural network which computes answers to queries. This was later shown to be equivalent to the unnormalized linear Transformer.Attention with seq2seq\nThe idea of encoder-decoder sequence transduction had been developed in the early 2010s (see previous papers). The papers most commonly cited as the originators that produced seq2seq are two concurrently published papers from 2014.\nA 380M-parameter model for machine translation uses two long short-term memories (LSTM). Its architecture consists of two parts. The encoder is an LSTM that takes in a sequence of tokens and turns it into a vector. The decoder is another LSTM that converts the vector into a sequence of tokens. Similarly, another 130M-parameter model used gated recurrent units (GRU) instead of LSTM. Later research showed that GRUs are neither better nor worse than LSTMs for seq2seq.\nThese early seq2seq models had no attention mechanism, and the state vector is accessible only after the last word of the source text was processed. Although in theory such a vector retains the information about the whole original sentence, in practice the information is poorly preserved. This is because the input is processed sequentially by one recurrent network into a fixed-size output vector, which is then processed by another recurrent network into an output. If the input is long, then the output vector would not be able to contain all relevant information, degrading the output. As evidence, reversing the input sentence improved seq2seq translation.\nThe RNNsearch model introduced an attention mechanism to seq2seq for machine translation to solve the bottleneck problem (of the fixed-size output vector), allowing the model to process long-distance dependencies more easily. The name is because it \"emulates searching through a source sentence during decoding a translation\".\nThe relative performances were compared between global (that of RNNsearch) and local (sliding window) attention model architectures for machine translation, finding that mixed attention had higher quality than global attention, while local attention reduced translation time.\nIn 2016, Google Translate was revamped to Google Neural Machine Translation, which replaced the previous model based on statistical machine translation. The new model was a seq2seq model where the encoder and the decoder were both 8 layers of bidirectional LSTM. It took nine months to develop, and it outperformed the statistical approach, which took ten years to develop.Parallelizing attention\nSeq2seq models with attention (including self-attention) still suffered from the same issue with recurrent networks, which is that they are hard to parallelize, which prevented them from being accelerated on GPUs. In 2016, decomposable attention applied a self-attention mechanism to feedforward networks, which are easy to parallelize, and achieved SOTA result in textual entailment with an order of magnitude fewer parameters than LSTMs. One of its authors, Jakob Uszkoreit, suspected that attention without recurrence is sufficient for language translation, thus the title \"attention is all you need\". That hypothesis was against conventional wisdom at the time, and even his father Hans Uszkoreit, a well-known computational linguist, was skeptical. In the same year, self-attention (called intra-attention or intra-sentence attention) was proposed for LSTMs.\nIn 2017, the original (100M-sized) encoder-decoder transformer model was proposed in the \"Attention is all you need\" paper. At the time, the focus of the research was on improving seq2seq for machine translation, by removing its recurrence to process all tokens in parallel, but preserving its dot-product attention mechanism to keep its text processing performance. This led to the introduction of a multi-head attention model that was easier to parallelize due to the use of independent heads and the lack of recurrence. Its parallelizability was an important factor to its widespread use in large neural networks.AI boom era\nAlready in spring 2017, even before the \"Attention is all you need\" preprint was published, one of the co-authors applied the \"decoder-only\" variation of the architecture to generate fictitious Wikipedia articles. Transformer architecture is now used alongside many generative models that contribute to the ongoing AI boom.\nIn language modelling, ELMo (2018) was a bi-directional LSTM that produces contextualized word embeddings, improving upon the line of research from bag of words and word2vec. It was followed by BERT (2018), an encoder-only Transformer model. In 2019 October, Google started using BERT to process search queries. In 2020, Google Translate replaced the previous RNN-encoder\u2013RNN-decoder model by a Transformer-encoder\u2013RNN-decoder model.\nStarting in 2018, the OpenAI GPT series of decoder-only Transformers became state of the art in natural language generation. In 2022, a chatbot based on GPT-3, ChatGPT, became unexpectedly popular, triggering a boom around large language models.\nSince 2020, Transformers have been applied in modalities beyond text, including the vision transformer, speech recognition, robotics, and multimodal. The vision transformer, in turn, stimulated new developments in convolutional neural networks. Image and video generators like DALL-E (2021), Stable Diffusion 3 (2024), and Sora (2024), use Transformers to analyse input data (like text prompts) by breaking it down into \"tokens\" and then calculating the relevance between each token using self-attention, which helps the model understand the context and relationships within the data.Training\nMethods for stabilizing training\nThe plain transformer architecture had difficulty converging. In the original paper the authors recommended using learning rate warmup. That is, the learning rate should linearly scale up from 0 to maximal value for the first part of the training (usually recommended to be 2% of the total number of training steps), before decaying again.\nA 2020 paper found that using layer normalization before (instead of after) multiheaded attention and feedforward layers stabilizes training, not requiring learning rate warmup.Pretrain-finetune\nTransformers typically are first pretrained by self-supervised learning on a large generic dataset, followed by supervised fine-tuning on a small task-specific dataset. The pretrain dataset is typically an unlabeled large corpus, such as The Pile. Tasks for pretraining and fine-tuning commonly include:\n\nlanguage modeling\nnext-sentence prediction\nquestion answering\nreading comprehension\nsentiment analysis\nparaphrasing\nThe T5 transformer report documents a large number of natural language pretraining tasks. Some examples are:\n\nrestoring or repairing incomplete or corrupted text. For example, the input, \"Thank you\u202f~~\u202fme to your party\u202f~~\u202fweek\", might generate the output, \"Thank you for inviting me to your party last week\".\ntranslation between natural languages (machine translation)\njudging the pragmatic acceptability of natural language. For example, the following sentence might be judged \"not acceptable\", because even though it is syntactically well-formed, it is improbable in ordinary human usage: The course is jumping well.\nNote that while each of these tasks is trivial or obvious for human native speakers of the language (or languages), they have typically proved challenging for previous generations of machine learning architecture.Tasks\nIn general, there are 3 classes of language modelling tasks: \"masked\", \"autoregressive\", and \"prefixLM\". These classes are independent of a specific modeling architecture such as Transformer, but they are often discussed in the context of Transformer.\nIn a masked task, one or more of the tokens is masked out, and the model would produce a probability distribution predicting what the masked-out tokens are based on the context. The loss function for the task is typically sum of log-perplexities for the masked-out tokens: \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          Loss\n        \n        =\n        \u2212\n        \n          \u2211\n          \n            t\n            \u2208\n            \n              masked tokens\n            \n          \n        \n        ln\n        \u2061\n        (\n        \n          probability of \n        \n        t\n        \n           conditional on its context\n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\text{Loss}}=-\\sum _{t\\in {\\text{masked tokens}}}\\ln({\\text{probability of }}t{\\text{ conditional on its context}})}\n  \nand the model is trained to minimize this loss function. The BERT series of models are trained for masked token prediction and another task.\nIn an autoregressive task, the entire sequence is masked at first, and the model produces a probability distribution for the first token. Then the first token is revealed and the model predicts the second token, and so on. The loss function for the task is still typically the same. The GPT series of models are trained by autoregressive tasks.\nIn a prefixLM task, the sequence is divided into two parts. The first part is presented as context, and the model predicts the first token of the second part. Then that would be revealed, and the model predicts the second token, and so on. The loss function for the task is still typically the same. The T5 series of models are trained by prefixLM tasks.\nNote that \"masked\" as in \"masked language modelling\" is not \"masked\" as in \"masked attention\", and \"prefixLM\" (prefix language modeling) is not \"prefixLM\" (prefix language model).Architecture\nAll transformers have the same primary components:\n\nTokenizers, which convert text into tokens.\nEmbedding layer, which converts tokens and positions of the tokens into vector representations.\nTransformer layers, which carry out repeated transformations on the vector representations, extracting more and more linguistic information. These consist of alternating attention and feedforward layers. There are two major types of transformer layers: encoder layers and decoder layers, with further variants.\nUn-embedding layer, which converts the final vector representations back to a probability distribution over the tokens.\nThe following description follows exactly the Transformer as described in the original paper. There are variants, described in the following section.\nBy convention, we write all vectors as row vectors. This, for example, means that pushing a vector through a linear layer means multiplying it by a weight matrix on the right, as \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n        W\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle xW}\n  \n.Tokenization\nAs the Transformer architecture natively processes numerical data, not text, there must be a translation between text and tokens. A token is an integer that represents a character, or a short segment of characters. On the input side, the input text is parsed into a token sequence. Similarly, on the output side, the output tokens are parsed back to text. The module doing the conversion between texts and token sequences is a tokenizer.\nThe set of all tokens is the vocabulary of the tokenizer, and its size is the vocabulary size \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          n\n          \n            vocabulary\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n_{\\text{vocabulary}}}\n  \n. When faced with tokens outside the vocabulary, typically a special token is used, written as \"[UNK]\" for \"unknown\".\nSome commonly used tokenizers are byte pair encoding, WordPiece, and SentencePiece.Embedding\nEach token is converted into an embedding vector via a lookup table. Equivalently stated, it multiplies a one-hot representation of the token by an embedding matrix \n  \n    \n      \n        M\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle M}\n  \n. For example, if the input token is \n  \n    \n      \n        3\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 3}\n  \n, then the one-hot representation is \n  \n    \n      \n        [\n        0\n        ,\n        0\n        ,\n        0\n        ,\n        1\n        ,\n        0\n        ,\n        0\n        ,\n        \u2026\n        ]\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle [0,0,0,1,0,0,\\dots ]}\n  \n, and its embedding vector is\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          E\n          m\n          b\n          e\n          d\n        \n        (\n        3\n        )\n        =\n        [\n        0\n        ,\n        0\n        ,\n        0\n        ,\n        1\n        ,\n        0\n        ,\n        0\n        ,\n        \u2026\n        ]\n        M\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {Embed} (3)=[0,0,0,1,0,0,\\dots ]M}\n  \nThe token embedding vectors are added to their respective positional encoding vectors (see below), producing the sequence of input vectors. \nThe number of dimensions in an embedding vector is called hidden size or embedding size and written as \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          d\n          \n            emb\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle d_{\\text{emb}}}\n  \n. This size is written as \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          d\n          \n            model\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle d_{\\text{model}}}\n  \n in the original Transformer paper.Un-embedding\nAn un-embedding layer is almost the reverse of an embedding layer. Whereas an embedding layer converts a token into a vector, an un-embedding layer converts a vector into a probability distribution over tokens.\nThe un-embedding layer is a linear-softmax layer:\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          U\n          n\n          E\n          m\n          b\n          e\n          d\n        \n        (\n        x\n        )\n        =\n        \n          s\n          o\n          f\n          t\n          m\n          a\n          x\n        \n        (\n        x\n        W\n        +\n        b\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {UnEmbed} (x)=\\mathrm {softmax} (xW+b)}\n  \nThe matrix has shape \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        \n          d\n          \n            emb\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          n\n          \n            vocabulary\n          \n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (d_{\\text{emb}},n_{\\text{vocabulary}})}\n  \n.

This allows the transformer to take any encoded position, and find the encoding of the position n-steps-ahead or n-steps-behind, by a matrix multiplication.\nBy taking a linear sum, any convolution can also be implemented as linear transformations:\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \u2211\n          \n            j\n          \n        \n        \n          c\n          \n            j\n          \n        \n        f\n        (\n        t\n        +\n        \u0394\n        \n          t\n          \n            j\n          \n        \n        )\n        =\n        \n          (\n          \n            \n              \u2211\n              \n                j\n              \n            \n            \n              c\n              \n                j\n              \n            \n            \n            \n              d\n              i\n              a\n              g\n            \n            (\n            f\n            (\n            \u0394\n            \n              t\n              \n                j\n              \n            \n            )\n            )\n          \n          )\n        \n        f\n        (\n        t\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\sum _{j}c_{j}f(t+\\Delta t_{j})=\\left(\\sum _{j}c_{j}\\,\\mathrm {diag} (f(\\Delta t_{j}))\\right)f(t)}\n  \nfor any constants \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          c\n          \n            j\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle c_{j}}\n  \n. This allows the transformer to take any encoded position and find a linear sum of the encoded locations of its neighbors. This sum of encoded positions, when fed into the attention mechanism, would create attention weights on its neighbors, much like what happens in a convolutional neural network language model. In the author's words, \"we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by relative position.\"\nIn typical implementations, all operations are done over the real numbers, not the complex numbers, but since complex multiplication can be implemented as real 2-by-2 matrix multiplication, this is a mere notational difference.Encoder-decoder (overview)\nLike earlier seq2seq models, the original transformer model used an encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder consists of encoding layers that process all the input tokens together one layer after another, while the decoder consists of decoding layers that iteratively process the encoder's output and the decoder's output tokens so far.\nThe purpose of each encoder layer is to create contextualized representations of the tokens, where each representation corresponds to a token that \"mixes\" information from other input tokens via self-attention mechanism. Each decoder layer contains two attention sublayers: (1) cross-attention for incorporating the output of encoder (contextualized input token representations), and (2) self-attention for \"mixing\" information among the input tokens to the decoder (i.e. the tokens generated so far during inference time).\nBoth the encoder and decoder layers have a feed-forward neural network for additional processing of their outputs and contain residual connections and layer normalization steps. These feed-forward layers contain most of the parameters in a Transformer model.Feedforward network\nThe feedforward network (FFN) modules in a Transformer are 2-layered multilayer perceptrons:\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          F\n          F\n          N\n        \n        (\n        x\n        )\n        =\n        \u03d5\n        (\n        x\n        \n          W\n          \n            (\n            1\n            )\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          b\n          \n            (\n            1\n            )\n          \n        \n        )\n        \n          W\n          \n            (\n            2\n            )\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          b\n          \n            (\n            2\n            )\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {FFN} (x)=\\phi (xW^{(1)}+b^{(1)})W^{(2)}+b^{(2)}}\n  \nwhere \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          W\n          \n            (\n            1\n            )\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle W^{(1)}}\n  \n and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          W\n          \n            (\n            2\n            )\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle W^{(2)}}\n  \n are weight matrices and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          b\n          \n            (\n            1\n            )\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle b^{(1)}}\n  \n and  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          b\n          \n            (\n            2\n            )\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle b^{(2)}}\n  \n are bias vectors, and \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03d5\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\phi }\n  \n is its activation function. The original Transformer used ReLU activation.\nThe number of neurons in the middle layer is called intermediate size (GPT), filter size (BERT), or feedforward size (BERT).

In addition, the scope of attention, or the range of token relationships captured by each attention head, can expand as tokens pass through successive layers. This allows the model to capture more complex and long-range dependencies in deeper layers. Many transformer attention heads encode relevance relations that are meaningful to humans. For example, some attention heads can attend mostly to the next word, while others mainly attend from verbs to their direct objects. The computations for each attention head can be performed in parallel, which allows for fast processing. The outputs for the attention layer are concatenated to pass into the feed-forward neural network layers.\nConcretely, let the multiple attention heads be indexed by \n  \n    \n      \n        i\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i}\n  \n, then we have\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          MultiheadedAttention\n        \n        (\n        Q\n        ,\n        K\n        ,\n        V\n        )\n        =\n        \n          \n            Concat\n          \n          \n            i\n            \u2208\n            [\n            \n              n\n              \n                heads\n              \n            \n            ]\n          \n        \n        (\n        \n          Attention\n        \n        (\n        Q\n        \n          W\n          \n            i\n          \n          \n            Q\n          \n        \n        ,\n        K\n        \n          W\n          \n            i\n          \n          \n            K\n          \n        \n        ,\n        V\n        \n          W\n          \n            i\n          \n          \n            V\n          \n        \n        )\n        )\n        \n          W\n          \n            O\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\text{MultiheadedAttention}}(Q,K,V)={\\text{Concat}}_{i\\in [n_{\\text{heads}}]}({\\text{Attention}}(QW_{i}^{Q},KW_{i}^{K},VW_{i}^{V}))W^{O}}\n  \n where the matrix \n  \n    \n      \n        X\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle X}\n  \n is the concatenation of word embeddings, and the matrices \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          W\n          \n            i\n          \n          \n            Q\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          W\n          \n            i\n          \n          \n            K\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          W\n          \n            i\n          \n          \n            V\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle W_{i}^{Q},W_{i}^{K},W_{i}^{V}}\n  \n are \"projection matrices\" owned by individual attention head \n  \n    \n      \n        i\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i}\n  \n, and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          W\n          \n            O\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle W^{O}}\n  \n is a final projection matrix owned by the whole multi-headed attention head.\nIt is theoretically possible for each attention head to have a different head dimension \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          d\n          \n            head\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle d_{\\text{head}}}\n  \n, but that is rarely the case in practice.\nAs an example, in the smallest GPT-2 model, there are only self-attention mechanisms.

The first encoder layer takes the sequence of input vectors from the embedding layer, producing a sequence of vectors. This sequence of vectors is processed by the second encoder, and so on. The output from the final encoder layer is then used by the decoder.\nAs the encoder processes the entire input all at once, every token can attend to every other token (all-to-all attention), so there is no need for causal masking.Decoder\nA decoder consists of an embedding layer, followed by multiple decoder layers, followed by an un-embedding layer.\nEach decoder consists of three major components: a causally masked self-attention mechanism, a cross-attention mechanism, and a feed-forward neural network. The decoder functions in a similar fashion to the encoder, but an additional attention mechanism is inserted which instead draws relevant information from the encodings generated by the encoders. This mechanism can also be called the encoder-decoder attention.\nLike the first encoder, the first decoder takes positional information and embeddings of the output sequence as its input, rather than encodings. The transformer must not use the current or future output to predict an output, so the output sequence must be partially masked to prevent this reverse information flow. This allows for autoregressive text generation. For decoding, all-to-all attention is inappropriate, because a token cannot attend to tokens not yet generated. Thus, the self-attention module in the decoder is causally masked.\nIn contrast, the cross-attention mechanism attends to the output vectors of the encoder, which is computed before the decoder starts decoding. Consequently, there is no need for masking in the cross-attention mechanism.\nSchematically, we have:\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                \n                  H\n                  \u2032\n                \n              \n              \n                \n                =\n                \n                  MaskedMultiheadedAttention\n                \n                (\n                H\n                ,\n                H\n                ,\n                H\n                )\n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  DecoderLayer\n                \n                (\n                H\n                )\n              \n              \n                \n                =\n                \n                  FFN\n                \n                (\n                \n                  MultiheadedAttention\n                \n                (\n                \n                  H\n                  \u2032\n                \n                ,\n                \n                  H\n                  \n                    E\n                  \n                \n                ,\n                \n                  H\n                  \n                    E\n                  \n                \n                )\n                )\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\begin{aligned}H'&={\\text{MaskedMultiheadedAttention}}(H,H,H)\\\\{\\text{DecoderLayer}}(H)&={\\text{FFN}}({\\text{MultiheadedAttention}}(H',H^{E},H^{E}))\\end{aligned}}}\n  \nwhere \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          H\n          \n            E\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle H^{E}}\n  \n is the matrix with rows being the output vectors from the encoder.\nThe last decoder is followed by a final un-embedding layer. to produce the output probabilities over the vocabulary. Then, one of the tokens is sampled according to the probability, and the decoder can be run again to produce the next token, etc, autoregressively generating output text.Adapted architectures\nMany large language models, since they do not need to predict a whole new sequence from an input sequence, only use the encoder or decoder of the original transformer architecture. Early GPT models are decoder-only models trained to predict the next token in a sequence. BERT, another language model, only makes use of an encoder, and is trained to predict a randomly masked token in a sequence.Full transformer architecture\nSublayers\nEach encoder layer contains 2 sublayers: the self-attention and the feedforward network. Each decoder layer contains 3 sublayers: the causally masked self-attention, the cross-attention, and the feedforward network.\n\nThe final points of detail are the residual connections and layer normalization (LayerNorm, or LN), which while conceptually unnecessary, are necessary for numerical stability and convergence.  \nThe residual connection, which is introduced to avoid vanishing gradient issues and stabilize the training process, can be expressed as follows: y = F(x) + x. The expression indicates that an output y is the sum of the transformation of input x (F(x)) and the input itself (x). Adding the input x can preserve the input information and avoid issues when the gradient of F(x) is close to zero.  \nSimilarly to how the feedforward network modules are applied individually to each vector, the LayerNorm is also applied individually to each vector. \nThere are two common conventions in use: the post-LN and the pre-LN convention.

The pre-LN convention, proposed several times in 2018, was found to be easier to train, requiring no warm-up, leading to faster convergence.Pseudocode\nThe following is the pseudocode for a standard pre-LN encoder-decoder Transformer, adapted from\n\ninput: Encoder input t_e\n       Decoder input t_d\noutput: Array of probability distributions, with shape (decoder vocabulary size x length(decoder output sequence))\n\n/* encoder */\nz_e \u2190 encoder.tokenizer(t_e)\n\nfor each t in 1:length(z_e) do\n    z_e[t] \u2190 encoder.embedding(z_e[t]) + encoder.positional_embedding(t)\n\nfor each l in 1:length(encoder.layers) do\n    layer \u2190 encoder.layers[l]\n\n    /* first sublayer */\n    z_e_copy \u2190 copy(z_e)\n    for each t in 1:length(z_e) do\n        z_e[t] \u2190 layer.layer_norm(z_e[t])\n    z_e \u2190 layer.multiheaded_attention(z_e, z_e, z_e)\n    for each t in 1:length(z_e) do\n        z_e[t] \u2190 z_e[t] + z_e_copy[t]\n\n    /* second sublayer */\n    z_e_copy \u2190 copy(z_e)\n    for each t in 1:length(z_e) do\n        z_e[t] \u2190 layer.layer_norm(z_e[t])\n    z_e \u2190 layer.feedforward(z_e)\n    for each t in 1:length(z_e) do\n        z_e[t] \u2190 z_e[t] + z_e_copy[t]\n\nfor each t in 1:length(z_e) do\n    z_e[t] \u2190 encoder.final_layer_norm(z_e[t])\n\n/* decoder */\nz_d \u2190 decoder.tokenizer(t_d)\n\nfor each t in 1:length(z_d) do\n    z_d[t] \u2190 decoder.embedding(z_d[t]) + decoder.positional_embedding(t)\n\nfor each l in 1:length(decoder.layers) do\n        layer \u2190 decoder.layers[l]\n\n        /* first sublayer */\n        z_d_copy \u2190 copy(z_d)\n        for each t in 1:length(z_d) do\n            z_d[t] \u2190 layer.layer_norm(z_d[t])\n        z_d \u2190 layer.masked_multiheaded_attention(z_d, z_d, z_d)\n        for each t in 1:length(z_d) do\n            z_d[t] \u2190 z_d[t] + z_d_copy[t]\n\n        /* second sublayer */\n        z_d_copy \u2190 copy(z_d)\n        for each t in 1:length(z_d) do\n            z_d[t] \u2190 layer.layer_norm(z_d[t])\n        z_d \u2190 layer.multiheaded_attention(z_d, z_e, z_e) \n        for each i in 1:length(z_d) do\n            z_d[t] \u2190 z_d[t] + z_d_copy[t]\n\n        /* third sublayer */\n        z_d_copy \u2190 copy(z_d)\n        for each t in 1:length(z_d) do\n            z_d[t] \u2190 layer.layer_norm(z_d[t])\n        z_d \u2190 layer.feedforward(z_d)\n        for each t in 1:length(z_d) do\n            z_d[t] \u2190 z_d[t] + z_d_copy[t]\n\nz_d \u2190 decoder.final_layer_norm(z_d)\n\noutput_distributions \u2190 []\nfor each t in 1:length(z_d) do\n    output_distributions.append(decoder.unembed(z_d[t]))\n\nreturn output_distributionsTerminology\nThe Transformer architecture, being modular, allows variations. Several common variations are described here.\nAn \"encoder-only\" Transformer applies the encoder to map an input text into a sequence of vectors that represent the input text. This is usually used for text embedding and representation learning for downstream applications. BERT is encoder-only. They are less often used currently, as they were found to be not significantly better than training an encoder-decoder Transformer, then taking just the encoder.\nA \"decoder-only\" Transformer is not literally decoder-only, since without an encoder, the cross-attention mechanism has nothing to attend to. Thus, the decoder layers in a decoder-only Transformer is composed of just two sublayers: the causally masked self-attention, and the feedforward network. This is usually used for text generation and instruction following. The models in the GPT series and Chinchilla series are decoder-only.\nAn \"encoder-decoder\" Transformer is generally the same as the original Transformer, with 2 sublayers per encoder layer and 3 sublayers per decoder layer, etc. They might have minor architectural improvements, such as alternative activation functions, changing the location of normalization, etc. This is also usually used for text generation and instruction following. The models in the T5 series are encoder-decoder.\nA \"prefixLM\" (prefix language model) is a decoder-only architecture, but with prefix masking, which is different from causal masking. Specifically, it has mask of the form:\u200aFigure 3\u200a\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          M\n          \n            prefixLM\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            [\n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    0\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \u2212\n                  \u221e\n                \n              \n              \n                \n                  \n                    0\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    M\n                    \n                      causal\n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n            ]\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle M_{\\text{prefixLM}}={\\begin{bmatrix}\\mathbf {0} &-\\infty \\\\\\mathbf {0} &M_{\\text{causal}}\\end{bmatrix}}}\n  \nwhere the first columns correspond to the \"prefix\", and the subsequent columns correspond to the autoregressively generated text based on the prefix. They resemble encoder-decoder models, but has less \"sparsity\". Such models are rarely used, though they are cited as theoretical possibilities and benchmarked comparisons.\nThere are also mixed seq2seq models. For example, in 2020, Google Translate replaced the previous RNN-encoder\u2013RNN-decoder model by a Transformer-encoder\u2013RNN-decoder model, on the argument that an RNN-decoder runs much faster than Transformer-decoder when run autoregressively.Subsequent work\nAlternative activation functions\nThe original transformer uses ReLU activation function. Other activation functions were developed. The Llama series and PaLM used SwiGLU; both GPT-1 and BERT used GELU. \nAlternative activation functions are often used in combination with Gated Linear Units in the feedforward module.Alternative normalizations\nThe normalization used in the Transformer can be different from LayerNorm. One example is RMSNorm which is used in the Llama series. Other examples include CapsuleNorm ScaleNorm, or FixNorm.Alternative positional encodings\nTransformers may use other positional encoding methods than sinusoidal. \nThe original Transformer paper reported using a learned positional encoding, but finding it not superior to the sinusoidal one. Later,  found that causal masking itself provides enough signal to a Transformer decoder that it can learn to implicitly perform absolute positional encoding without the positional encoding module.RoPE\nRoPE (rotary positional embedding), is best explained by considering a list of 2-dimensional vectors \n  \n    \n      \n        [\n        (\n        \n          x\n          \n            1\n          \n          \n            (\n            1\n            )\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          x\n          \n            1\n          \n          \n            (\n            2\n            )\n          \n        \n        )\n        ,\n        (\n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n          \n            (\n            1\n            )\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n          \n            (\n            2\n            )\n          \n        \n        )\n        ,\n        (\n        \n          x\n          \n            3\n          \n          \n            (\n            1\n            )\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          x\n          \n            3\n          \n          \n            (\n            2\n            )\n          \n        \n        )\n        ,\n        .\n        .\n        .\n        ]\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle [(x_{1}^{(1)},x_{1}^{(2)}),(x_{2}^{(1)},x_{2}^{(2)}),(x_{3}^{(1)},x_{3}^{(2)}),...]}\n  \n.

Since it is directly plugged into the attention mechanism, it can be combined with any positional encoder that is plugged into the \"bottom\" of the entire network (which is where the sinusoidal encoder on the original transformer, as well as RoPE and many others, are located).Relative Position Encodings\nRelative Position Encodings is similar to ALiBi, but more generic:\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                \n                  Attention\n                \n                (\n                Q\n                ,\n                K\n                ,\n                V\n                )\n                =\n                \n                  softmax\n                \n                \n                  (\n                  \n                    \n                      \n                        \n                          Q\n                          \n                            K\n                            \n                              \n                                T\n                              \n                            \n                          \n                        \n                        \n                          \n                            d\n                            \n                              k\n                            \n                          \n                        \n                      \n                    \n                    +\n                    B\n                  \n                  )\n                \n                V\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\begin{aligned}{\\text{Attention}}(Q,K,V)={\\text{softmax}}\\left({\\frac {QK^{\\mathrm {T} }}{\\sqrt {d_{k}}}}+B\\right)V\\end{aligned}}}\n  \nwhere \n  \n    \n      \n        B\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle B}\n  \n is a Toeplitz matrix, that is, \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          B\n          \n            i\n            ,\n            j\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          B\n          \n            \n              i\n              \u2032\n            \n            ,\n            \n              j\n              \u2032\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle B_{i,j}=B_{i',j'}}\n  \n whenever \n  \n    \n      \n        i\n        \u2212\n        j\n        =\n        \n          i\n          \u2032\n        \n        \u2212\n        \n          j\n          \u2032\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i-j=i'-j'}\n  \n. This is contrasted with the original sinusoidal positional encoding, which is an \"absolute positional encoding\".Efficient implementation\nThe transformer model has been implemented in standard deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch. Transformers is a library produced by Hugging Face that supplies transformer-based architectures and pretrained models.KV caching\nWhen an autoregressive transformer is used for inference, such as generating text, the query vector is different at each step, but the already-computed key and value vectors are always the same. The KV caching method saves the computed key and value vectors at each attention block, so that they are not recomputed at each new token. PagedAttention applies memory paging to KV caching.\nIf a transformer is used with a baked-in prompt, such as [\"You are a customer support agent...\"], then the key and value vectors can be computed for the prompt, and saved on disk. The saving in compute is significant when the model is used for many short interactions, such as in online chatbots.FlashAttention\nFlashAttention is an algorithm that implements the transformer attention mechanism efficiently on a GPU. It is a communication-avoiding algorithm that performs matrix multiplications in blocks, such that each block fits within the cache of a GPU, and by careful management of the blocks it minimizes data copying between GPU caches (as data movement is slow). See the page on softmax for details.\nAn improved version, FlashAttention-2, was developed to cater to the rising demand for language models capable of handling longer context lengths. It offers enhancements in work partitioning and parallelism, enabling it to achieve up to 230 TFLOPs/s on A100 GPUs (FP16/BF16), a 2x speed increase over the original FlashAttention.\nKey advancements in FlashAttention-2 include the reduction of non-matmul FLOPs, improved parallelism over the sequence length dimension, better work partitioning between GPU warps, and added support for head dimensions up to 256 and multi-query attention (MQA) and grouped-query attention (GQA).\nBenchmarks revealed FlashAttention-2 to be up to 2x faster than FlashAttention and up to 9x faster than a standard attention implementation in PyTorch. Future developments include optimization for new hardware like H100 GPUs and new data types like FP8.Multi-Query Attention\nMulti-Query Attention changes the multiheaded attention mechanism.

MQA is GQA with one group, while standard multiheaded attention is GQA with the maximal number of groups.\n\nMultihead Latent Attention (MLA) is a low-rank approximation to standard MHA. Specifically, each hidden vector, before entering the attention mechanism, is first projected to two low-dimensional spaces (\"latent space\"), one for query and one for key-value (KV vector). This design minimizes the KV cache, as only the low-dimensional KV vector needs to be cached.Speculative decoding\nSpeculative decoding is a method to accelerate token decoding. Similarly to speculative execution in CPUs, future tokens are computed quickly, then verified. If the quickly computed tokens are incorrect, they are discarded and computed slowly.\nThe key factor in speculative decoding is that a Transformer decoder can verify faster than it can decode, in the following sense.\nSuppose we have two transformer models like GPT-3 and GPT-3-small, both with a context window size of 512. To generate an entire context window autoregressively with greedy decoding with GPT-3, it must be run for 512 times, each time generating a token \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          x\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        ,\n        .\n        .\n        .\n        ,\n        \n          x\n          \n            512\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{512}}\n  \n, taking time \n  \n    \n      \n        512\n        \n          T\n          \n            GPT-3\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 512T_{\\text{GPT-3}}}\n  \n. However, if we had some educated guess for the values of these tokens, we could verify all of them in parallel, in one run of the model, by checking that each \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          x\n          \n            t\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x_{t}}\n  \n is indeed the token with the largest log-likelihood in the \n  \n    \n      \n        t\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle t}\n  \n-th output.\nIn speculative decoding, a smaller model or some other simple heuristic is used to generate a few speculative tokens that are subsequently verified by the larger model. For example, suppose we use GPT-3-small to generate four speculative tokens: \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                x\n                ~\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          \n            \n              \n                x\n                ~\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          \n            \n              \n                x\n                ~\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            3\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          \n            \n              \n                x\n                ~\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            4\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\tilde {x}}_{1},{\\tilde {x}}_{2},{\\tilde {x}}_{3},{\\tilde {x}}_{4}}\n  \n.

However, that vector can then be further processed by another Transformer block to predict the next token, and so on for arbitrarily many steps into the future. This trades off accuracy for speed, since each new token costs just one more Transformer block, rather than the entire stack.Sub-quadratic transformers\nTraining transformer-based architectures can be expensive, especially for long inputs. Many methods have been developed to attempt to address the issue. In the image domain, Swin Transformer is an efficient architecture that performs attention inside shifting windows. In the audio domain, SepTr decouples the attention in time and frequency domains. Long Range Arena (2020) is a standard benchmark for comparing the behavior of transformer architectures over long inputs.Alternative attention graphs\nThe standard attention graph is either all-to-all or causal, both of which scales as \n  \n    \n      \n        O\n        (\n        \n          N\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle O(N^{2})}\n  \n where \n  \n    \n      \n        N\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle N}\n  \n is the number of tokens in a sequence.\nReformer (2020) reduces the computational load from \n  \n    \n      \n        O\n        (\n        \n          N\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle O(N^{2})}\n  \n to \n  \n    \n      \n        O\n        (\n        N\n        ln\n        \u2061\n        N\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle O(N\\ln N)}\n  \n by using locality-sensitive hashing and reversible layers. \nSparse attention uses attention graphs that grows slower than \n  \n    \n      \n        O\n        (\n        \n          N\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle O(N^{2})}\n  \n. For example, BigBird (2020) uses random small-world networks which grows as \n  \n    \n      \n        O\n        (\n        N\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle O(N)}\n  \n.\nOrdinary transformers require a memory size that is quadratic in the size of the context window. Attention-free transformers reduce this to a linear dependence while still retaining the advantages of a transformer by linking the key to the value.Random Feature Attention\nRandom Feature Attention (2021) uses Fourier random features:\n  \n    \n      \n        \u03c6\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        =\n        \n          \n            1\n            \n              D\n            \n          \n        \n        [\n        cos\n        \u2061\n        \u27e8\n        \n          w\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        x\n        \u27e9\n        ,\n        sin\n        \u2061\n        \u27e8\n        \n          w\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        x\n        \u27e9\n        ,\n        \u22ef\n        cos\n        \u2061\n        \u27e8\n        \n          w\n          \n            D\n          \n        \n        ,\n        x\n        \u27e9\n        ,\n        sin\n        \u2061\n        \u27e8\n        \n          w\n          \n            D\n          \n        \n        ,\n        x\n        \u27e9\n        \n          ]\n          \n            T\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\varphi (x)={\\frac {1}{\\sqrt {D}}}[\\cos \\langle w_{1},x\\rangle ,\\sin \\langle w_{1},x\\rangle ,\\cdots \\cos \\langle w_{D},x\\rangle ,\\sin \\langle w_{D},x\\rangle ]^{T}}\n  \nwhere \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          w\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        .\n        .\n        .\n        ,\n        \n          w\n          \n            D\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle w_{1},...,w_{D}}\n  \n are independent samples from the normal distribution \n  \n    \n      \n        N\n        (\n        0\n        ,\n        \n          \u03c3\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        I\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle N(0,\\sigma ^{2}I)}\n  \n.

A 2022 study found that Transformers pretrained only on natural language can be finetuned on only 0.03% of parameters and become competitive with LSTMs on a variety of logical and visual tasks, demonstrating transfer learning. The LLaVA was a vision-language model composed of a language model (Vicuna-13B) and a vision model (ViT-L/14), connected by a linear layer. Only the linear layer is finetuned.\nVision transformers adapt the transformer to computer vision by breaking down input images as a series of patches, turning them into vectors, and treating them like tokens in a standard transformer.\nConformer and later Whisper follow the same pattern for speech recognition, first turning the speech signal into a spectrogram, which is then treated like an image, i.e. broken down into a series of patches, turned into vectors and treated like tokens in a standard transformer.\nPerceivers are a variant of Transformers designed for multimodality.\nFor image generation, notable architectures are DALL-E 1 (2021), Parti (2022), Phenaki (2023), and Muse (2023). Unlike later models, DALL-E is not a diffusion model. Instead, it uses a decoder-only Transformer that autoregressively generates a text, followed by the token representation of an image, which is then converted by a variational autoencoder to an image. Parti is an encoder-decoder Transformer, where the encoder processes a text prompt, and the decoder generates a token representation of an image. Muse is an encoder-only Transformer that is trained to predict masked image tokens from unmasked image tokens. During generation, all input tokens are masked, and the highest-confidence predictions are included for the next iteration, until all tokens are predicted. Phenaki is a text-to-video model. It is a bidirectional masked transformer conditioned on pre-computed text tokens. The generated tokens are then decoded to a video.Applications\nThe transformer has had great success in natural language processing (NLP). Many large language models such as GPT-2, GPT-3, GPT-4, Gemini, AlbertAGPT, Claude, BERT, Grok, XLNet, RoBERTa and ChatGPT demonstrate the ability of transformers to perform a wide variety of NLP-related subtasks and their related real-world applications, including:\n\nmachine translation\ntime series prediction\ndocument summarization\ndocument generation\nnamed entity recognition (NER)\nwriting computer code based on requirements expressed in natural language.\nspeech-to-text\nBeyond traditional NLP, the transformer architecture has had success in other applications, such as:\n\nbiological sequence analysis\nvideo understanding\nprotein folding (such as AlphaFold)\nevaluating chess board positions. Using static evaluation alone (that is, with no Minimax search) transformer achieved an Elo of 2895, putting it at grandmaster level.See also\nseq2seq \u2013 Family of machine learning approaches\nPerceiver \u2013 Variant of Transformer designed for multimodal data\nVision transformer \u2013 Machine learning model for vision processing\nLarge language model \u2013 Type of machine learning model\nBERT (language model) \u2013 Series of language models developed by Google AI\nGenerative pre-trained transformer \u2013 Type of large language model\nT5 (language model) \u2013 Series of large language models developed by Google AINotes\nReferences\n== Further reading ==", "result": "# Introduction\n\nThe Transformer is a neural network architecture introduced in 2017 that relies solely on attention mechanisms to draw global dependencies between elements in the input and output sequences. It was proposed in the paper \"Attention Is All You Need\" by Vaswani et al., and is based on an earlier model introduced by Google Research in 2015. Since then, the Transformer architecture has become one of the most widely used architectures in deep learning, with applications ranging from machine translation to natural language generation, speech recognition, image captioning, and more. It has even been extended to other modalities such as vision, multimodal tasks, and bioinformatics.\n\nThe Transformer was initially developed for the task of machine translation but has since been applied to many other areas where sequence modeling is needed, such as natural language processing, speech recognition, and bioinformatics. As of 2024, Transformers are being used in state-of-the-art models for language modeling, natural language generation, question answering, machine translation, and other natural language processing tasks.\n\nThe Transformer architecture has led to significant advances in the field of artificial intelligence, enabling machines to better understand and process human language and other forms of structured data. Its popularity and success have made it one of the most important and widely studied architectures in deep learning today.\n\nThe Transformer architecture is considered a major breakthrough in the field of deep learning because it allows for efficient and effective processing of sequential data without the need for recurrent neural networks (RNNs). This makes it possible to train much deeper networks than was previously feasible with RNNs, which often suffer from vanishing gradient problems when trained on long sequences. The Transformer architecture has also enabled the development of more powerful and flexible language models, such as BERT and GPT-3, which have achieved state-of-the-art results on a wide range of natural language processing tasks.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Transformer architecture was first introduced in 2017 by Vaswani et al. in the paper \"Attention Is All You Need\". The original Transformer architecture was designed specifically for the task of machine translation, and was based on an earlier model introduced by Google Research in 2015. Since then, the Transformer architecture has been adapted and extended to a wide range of other applications, including natural language processing, speech recognition, image classification, and reinforcement learning.\n\nPredecessors\n\nEarly approaches to sequence modeling included recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and their variants, such as long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. These models were able to capture long-range dependencies in sequential data, but suffered from vanishing gradient problems when trained on long sequences. As a result, they were often limited to relatively short sequences and required careful tuning of hyperparameters to achieve good performance.\n\nOne of the key limitations of RNNs is that they process the input sequence sequentially, one element at a time. This means that the model must retain information about the entire input sequence in its hidden state in order to make predictions about future elements. This can be computationally expensive and may not be possible when dealing with very long sequences. In addition, the sequential processing of RNNs can lead to a loss of information about the relative positions of elements in the input sequence.\n\nTo address these limitations, several researchers have proposed alternative approaches to sequence modeling. One such approach is the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for sequence modeling. CNNs are typically used for image processing, but they have also been applied to sequence data by treating the input sequence as a two-dimensional array where each row corresponds to a different element in the sequence and each column corresponds to a different feature. This allows the CNN to capture local patterns in the sequence data, but it does not allow for the capture of long-range dependencies.\n\nAnother approach to sequence modeling is the use of attention mechanisms. Attention mechanisms allow the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence when making predictions about a particular element. This allows the model to capture long-range dependencies in the input sequence without having to retain all of the information in its hidden state. Attention mechanisms have been successfully applied to a wide range of tasks, including machine translation, image captioning, and speech recognition.\n\nAttention with seq2seq\n\nIn the early days of machine translation, the prevailing paradigm was the encoder-decoder framework, in which the encoder converts the source sentence into a fixed-length representation, and the decoder generates the target sentence by predicting one word at a time. This approach worked reasonably well for simple translation tasks, but struggled with longer sentences and more complex linguistic phenomena.\n\nThe first step toward addressing these limitations came in 2014, when Cho et al. introduced the LSTM-based Encoder-Decoder model for machine translation. This model used a bidirectional LSTM to encode the source sentence, and a unidirectional LSTM to decode the target sentence. While this model showed some improvement over previous approaches, it still struggled with longer sentences and more complex linguistic phenomena.\n\nIn 2015, Bahdanau et al. introduced the first attention-based encoder-decoder model for machine translation. This model used a single LSTM to encode the source sentence, and a separate LSTM to decode the target sentence. The decoder would attend to different parts of the source sentence at each time step, allowing it to focus on different parts of the input as it generated the output. This approach significantly improved the quality of translations, especially for longer and more complex sentences.\n\nParallelizing attention\n\nIn 2017, Vaswani et al. introduced the Transformer model, which replaced the recurrent neural networks (RNNs) used in previous encoder-decoder models with attention mechanisms. This allowed the model to process the input sequence in parallel, rather than sequentially, which made it much faster and more efficient. The Transformer model also used a novel attention mechanism called multi-head attention, which allowed the model to capture different types of relationships between elements in the input sequence.\n\nThe Transformer model was a major breakthrough in the field of machine translation, and quickly became the dominant paradigm for this task. It has since been applied to a wide range of other tasks, including natural language understanding, question answering, and image captioning.\n\nAI boom era\n\nThe Transformer architecture has had a profound impact on the field of artificial intelligence, particularly in the area of natural language processing. Its ability to capture long-range dependencies in sequential data has made it possible to build more powerful and flexible language models, such as BERT and GPT-3, which have achieved state-of-the-art results on a wide range of natural language processing tasks. In addition, the Transformer architecture has inspired the development of many other neural network architectures for tasks such as computer vision, speech recognition, and reinforcement learning.\n\nTraining\n\nThe training of transformer models involves several key processes, including forward pass, backward pass, and optimization. During the forward pass, the input text is tokenized and embedded into a vector space, and the resulting embeddings are passed through a series of transformer layers. Each transformer layer consists of self-attention and feed-forward networks, which are used to capture dependencies between words in the input text. The output of the final transformer layer is then passed through a fully connected layer and a softmax function to produce a probability distribution over the vocabulary of possible output tokens.\n\nDuring the backward pass, the gradients of the loss function with respect to the model parameters are computed using backpropagation. These gradients are then used to update the model parameters using an optimization algorithm such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or Adam. The optimization algorithm adjusts the model parameters in the direction of steepest descent of the loss function, with the goal of minimizing the loss and improving the model's performance on the task at hand.\n\nMethods for stabilizing training\n\nThe training of transformer models can be challenging due to the large number of parameters and the complexity of the attention mechanism. To help stabilize training, several methods have been proposed. One common technique is learning rate warmup, which gradually increases the learning rate during the early stages of training. This helps the model converge more quickly and prevents it from getting stuck in local minima. Another technique is modifying layer normalization, which has been shown to improve the stability of training for transformer models.\n\nPretrain-finetune\n\nThe pretrain-finetune approach is a popular method for training transformer models. In this approach, the model is first trained on a large corpus of unlabeled text data using a self-supervised objective, such as masked language modeling. This pretraining step allows the model to learn general-purpose language representations that can be applied to a wide range of downstream tasks. Once the model has been pre-trained, it is then fine-tuned on a smaller dataset of labeled data for a specific task, such as sentiment analysis or named entity recognition. This fine-tuning step allows the model to adapt to the specific characteristics of the task and improve its performance on that task.\n\nTasks\n\nTransformer models are commonly used for language modeling, which involves predicting the next token in a sequence of text given the previous tokens. Language modeling is a fundamental task in natural language processing and has many practical applications, such as text generation, machine translation, and speech recognition.\n\nThere are three main types of language modeling tasks that are commonly used to train transformer models:\n\n* Masked language modeling: In this task, some tokens in the input sequence are randomly masked, and the model is trained to predict the masked tokens based on the remaining tokens in the sequence. This type of task is useful for training models that can handle missing or incomplete information.\n* Autoregressive language modeling: In this task, the model is trained to predict the next token in the sequence based only on the previous tokens in the sequence. This type of task is useful for training models that can generate text one token at a time.\n* PrefixLM: In this task, the model is trained to predict the next token in the sequence based on both the previous tokens in the sequence and a prefix of the current token. This type of task is useful for training models that can handle long-range dependencies in the input sequence.\n\nArchitecture\n\nA transformer model consists of several components, including a tokenizer, embedding layer, transformer layers, and an un-embedding layer. The tokenizer is responsible for converting the input text into a sequence of tokens, which are then passed through the embedding layer to obtain a sequence of embedding vectors. The transformer layers are composed of self-attention and feed-forward networks, which are used to capture dependencies between words in the input text. The un-embedding layer is used to convert the output of the transformer layers back into a probability distribution over the vocabulary of possible output tokens.\n\nTokenization\n\nTokenization is the process of breaking down text into individual units called tokens. In a transformer model, tokens are typically represented as integers, and the tokenizer is responsible for mapping each token to its corresponding integer representation. The tokenizer also handles special tokens, such as the start and end of a sentence, which are used to mark the beginning and end of the input sequence.\n\nEmbedding\n\nThe embedding layer is responsible for transforming the sequence of tokens into a sequence of embedding vectors. Each token is mapped to a dense vector of fixed size, which captures its semantic meaning and context within the input sequence. The embedding layer is typically implemented using a lookup table, which stores the embedding vectors for each token.\n\nUn-embedding\n\nThe un-embedding layer is used to convert the output of the transformer layers back into a probability distribution over the vocabulary of possible output tokens. This is done by applying a linear transformation to the output of the transformer layers and passing the result through a softmax function. The un-embedding layer is closely related to the embedding layer, and the two are often implemented using the same set of parameters (a technique known as weight tying).\n\nPositional encoding\n\nPositional encoding is a technique used to provide information about the position of each token in the input sequence to the transformer model. This is necessary because the transformer model does not have access to the order of the tokens in the sequence. Without positional encoding, the model would treat all tokens as equally important, regardless of their position in the sequence.\n\nThere are several different methods for computing positional encodings, including learned positional encodings and sinusoidal positional encodings. Learned positional encodings are learned as part of the model's parameters, while sinusoidal positional encodings are computed using a combination of sine and cosine functions.\n\nEncoder-decoder (overview)\n\nThe original transformer model, introduced by Vaswani et al., consists of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder processes the input sequence and produces a fixed-length representation of the sequence, while the decoder generates the output sequence by predicting one token at a time. The encoder and decoder are connected via a cross-attention mechanism, which allows the decoder to attend to different parts of the input sequence as it generates the output.\n\nFeedforward network\n\nThe feedforward network is a component of the transformer model that is used to capture nonlinear relationships between tokens in the input sequence. It consists of two fully connected layers, separated by a nonlinear activation function (such as the rectified linear unit (ReLU)). The feedforward network is applied to each token in the input sequence independently, and its output is added to the input sequence using a residual connection.\n\nScaled dot-product attention\n\nScaled dot-product attention is a type of attention mechanism used in transformer models. It computes attention scores between pairs of tokens in the input sequence, and uses these scores to weigh the contributions of each token to the output. The attention scores are computed using a dot product between the query vector and the key vector, scaled by the square root of the dimensionality of the vectors, and then passed through a softmax function. The weighted sum of the value vectors is then computed to produce the output.\n\nAttention head\n\nThe attention head is a component of the transformer model that is used to compute attention scores between pairs of tokens in the input sequence. It consists of three matrices: the query matrix, the key matrix, and the value matrix. The query matrix is multiplied by the input sequence to produce the query vector, the key matrix is multiplied by the input sequence to produce the key vector, and the value matrix is multiplied by the input sequence to produce the value vector. The attention scores are computed using a dot product between the query vector and the key vector, scaled by the square root of the dimensionality of the vectors, and then passed through a softmax function. The weighted sum of the value vectors is then computed to produce the output.\n\nMultiheaded attention\n\nMultiheaded attention is a variant of the attention mechanism used in transformer models. It allows the model to capture different types of relationships between tokens in the input sequence by using multiple attention heads in parallel. Each attention head computes attention scores between pairs of tokens in the input sequence, and the outputs of all the attention heads are concatenated and passed through a linear projection layer to produce the final output.\n\nMasked attention\n\nMasked attention is a variant of the attention mechanism used in transformer models that ensures that the model generates output tokens in a strictly left-to-right manner. This is achieved by masking the attention scores for tokens that come after the current token in the input sequence. The masked attention scores are then passed through a softmax function to produce the attention weights, which are used to compute the weighted sum of the value vectors to produce the output.\n\nEncoder\n\nThe encoder is a component of the transformer model that processes the input sequence and produces a fixed-length representation of the sequence. It consists of a stack of self-attention layers, followed by a stack of feed-forward layers. The self-attention layers are used to capture dependencies between tokens in the input sequence, while the feed-forward layers are used to capture nonlinear relationships between tokens.\n\nDecoder\n\nThe decoder is a component of the transformer model that generates the output sequence by predicting one token at a time. It consists of a stack of self-attention layers, followed by a stack of cross-attention layers, followed by a stack of feed-forward layers. The self-attention layers are used to capture dependencies between tokens in the output sequence, the cross-attention layers are used to attend to the fixed-length representation of the input sequence produced by the encoder, and the feed-forward layers are used to capture nonlinear relationships between tokens in the output sequence.\n\nAdapted architectures\n\nLarge language models such as GPT and BERT only use either the encoder or decoder component of the original transformer architecture, respectively.\n\nFull transformer architecture\n\nThe full transformer architecture is composed of the following components:\n\n* Tokenizer\n* Embedding\n* Transformer encoder\n* Transformer decoder\n* Un-embedding\n\nSublayers\n\nThe sublayers of the transformer encoder and decoder layers are defined as follows:\n\n* Residual connection with layer normalization (pre-LN convention)\n* Residual connection with layer normalization (post-LN convention)\n\nPseudocode\n\nThe following pseudocode describes the pre-LN encoder-decoder Transformer architecture:\n\n    def preprocess(text):\n        # Tokenize the text and convert it to embeddings\n        return tokenize(text)\n\n    def encoder(x):\n        # Apply the encoder layers to the input sequence\n        for i in range(num_encoder_layers):\n            x = encoder_layer(x)\n        return x\n\n    def decoder(x, y):\n        # Apply the decoder layers to the input and output sequences\n        for i in range(num_decoder_layers):\n            x = decoder_layer(x, y)\n        return x\n\n    def postprocess(x):\n        # Convert the output embeddings to probabilities\n        return unembed(x)\n\n    def model(text, target):\n        # Preprocess the input text\n        x = preprocess(text)\n        # Encode the input sequence\n        x = encoder(x)\n        # Decode the output sequence\n        y = decoder(x, target)\n        # Postprocess the output sequence\n        return postprocess(y)\n\n\nTerminology\n\nThe following table summarizes the terminology used in the transformer architecture:\n\n| Name | Description |\n| - | - |\n| Encoder-only | A transformer architecture that only contains an encoder. Used for tasks such as language modeling. |\n| Decoder-only | A transformer architecture that only contains a decoder. Used for tasks such as machine translation. |\n| Encoder-decoder | A transformer architecture that contains both an encoder and a decoder. Used for tasks such as machine translation. |\n| PrefixLM | A transformer architecture that is conditioned on a prefix of the input sequence. Used for tasks such as text generation. |\n| Mixed seq2seq | A transformer architecture that combines elements of both encoder-decoder and prefixLM architectures. Used for tasks such as machine translation. |\n\nSubsequent work\n\nSince the original publication of the Transformer architecture, there have been many subsequent works that have built upon and improved upon the original model. Some of these works include:\n\n* SwiGLU: An alternative activation function that combines gated linear units (GLUs) with sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent functions.\n* GELU: An alternative activation function that uses a Gaussian error linear unit (GELU) to introduce nonlinearity into the model.\n* Swin Transformer: A transformer architecture that is designed to handle very long sequences.\n* SepTr: A transformer architecture that is optimized for efficient training on large datasets.\n* Long Range Arena: A benchmark for evaluating the performance of transformer architectures on long-range prediction tasks.\n\nAlternative activation functions\n\nAlternative activation functions that can be used in transformer architectures include SwiGLU and GELU. SwiGLU combines gated linear units (GLUs) with sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent functions, while GELU uses a Gaussian error linear unit (GELU) to introduce nonlinearity into the model. Both of these activation functions have been used in transformer architectures such as Llama, PaLM, GPT-1, and BERT.\n\nAlternative normalizations\n\nAlternative normalization techniques that can be used in transformer architectures include RMSNorm, CapsuleNorm, ScaleNorm, and FixNorm. These techniques have been used in transformer architectures such as Llama, PaLM, GPT-1, and BERT.\n\nAlternative positional encodings\n\nAlternative methods of positional encoding in transformers include learned positional encodings and causal masking. Causal masking is used to prevent the model from attending to future tokens in the input sequence, which is necessary for tasks such as text generation.\n\nRoPE\n\nRotary positional embedding (RoPE) is a technique used in transformer architectures to encode positional information using trigonometric transformations and complex numbers. This allows the model to maintain relative positional relationships between vectors, which is important for tasks such as long-range prediction. RoPE has been shown to be more effective than traditional positional encodings for certain tasks, such as language modeling.\n\nALiBi\n\nAttention with Linear Biases (ALiBi) is a technique used in transformer architectures to incorporate a linear bias matrix into the attention mechanism. This allows the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence with different strengths, which can improve performance on tasks such as language modeling. ALiBi has been shown to be compatible with a wide range of positional encoders, including learned positional encodings.\n\nRelative Position Encodings\n\nRelative Position Encodings are a type of positional encoding that are used in transformer architectures to encode the relative positions of tokens in the input sequence. Unlike absolute positional encodings, which encode the absolute position of each token in the sequence, relative positional encodings encode the relative positions of tokens with respect to each other. This allows the model to maintain the relative ordering of tokens in the sequence, which can be important for tasks such as language modeling.\n\nEfficient implementation\n\nThe transformer model has been efficiently implemented in popular deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow. The Hugging Face's Transformers library provides a wide range of transformer-based architectures and pretrained models, making it easy for developers to use transformer models in their own projects.\n\nKV caching\n\nKV caching is a technique used in autoregressive transformers to optimize the inference process when the same prompt is used repeatedly. By caching the key-value pairs from previous tokens, the model can avoid recomputing them for subsequent tokens, which can significantly reduce the computational cost of inference.\n\nFlashAttention\n\nFlashAttention is a high-performance implementation of the attention mechanism that is optimized for GPUs. It uses a technique called flash attention to compute the attention scores in parallel, which can significantly reduce the computation time required to perform attention computations. FlashAttention-2 is an updated version of FlashAttention that is even more efficient, especially for longer context lengths.\n\nMulti-Query Attention\n\nMulti-Query Attention is a variant of the multiheaded attention mechanism in transformer models. It reduces the number of queries used in the attention mechanism from the number of heads to one, which can improve model quality and reduce training and inference time. Grouped-query attention is a related technique that groups multiple queries into a single query and applies a linear transformation to the queries before computing the attention scores.\n\nSpeculative decoding\n\nSpeculative decoding is a technique used in transformer models to accelerate token decoding. It involves using a smaller model or heuristic to generate a candidate token, and then using a larger model to verify whether the candidate token is correct. This approach can be used in both greedy and non-greedy decoding scenarios, and can significantly reduce the time required to generate output sequences.\n\nSub-quadratic transformers\n\nSub-quadratic transformers are architectures that are designed to handle very long sequences more efficiently than standard transformer architectures. They do this by using techniques such as linear attention, which reduces the complexity of the attention mechanism from quadratic to linear, and sparse attention, which only attends to a subset of the tokens in the input sequence.\n\nAlternative attention graphs\n\nAlternative attention graphs are attention mechanisms that are used in transformer architectures to reduce the computational complexity of the attention mechanism. Examples of these include the Reformer's linear attention and BigBird's random attention.\n\nRandom Feature Attention\n\nRandom Feature Attention is a technique used in transformer architectures to approximate the attention mechanism using random feature maps. This allows the attention mechanism to be computed in linear time, which can be useful for handling very long sequences.\n\nMultimodality\n\nTransformers have been adapted for use in tasks beyond language processing, such as vision, speech, and image generation. Vision Transformers (ViTs) are transformer architectures that are used for image classification and other computer vision tasks. Conformer is a transformer architecture that is used for speech recognition and other audio processing tasks. Whisper is a transformer architecture that is used for speech recognition and automatic speech recognition. Various image generation architectures, such as CLIP, DALL-E, and Imagen, use transformer architectures to generate images from textual descriptions.\n\nApplications\n\nThe transformer architecture has been successfully applied to a wide range of tasks in natural language processing, such as machine translation, text classification, and question answering. It has also been used in other domains, such as biological sequence analysis and chess evaluation.\n\nSee also\n\n* Machine translation\n* Natural language processing\n* Speech recognition\n* Image classification\n* Reinforcement learning\n\nNotes\n\n* \u2191 Zhang, Yizhe; Huang, Xiaodong; Liu, Zhiyuan; Wang, Dong (2021-01-01). \"Distilling Knowledge from Transformer Models\".
