Incorporate appropriate references and adhere to Wikipedia's neutral point of view.", "input": "", "output": "Introduction\nNamed-entity recognition (NER) (also known as (named) entity identification, entity chunking, and entity extraction) is a subtask of information extraction that seeks to locate and classify named entities mentioned in unstructured text into pre-defined categories such as person names, organizations, locations, medical codes, time expressions, quantities, monetary values, percentages, etc.\nMost research on NER/NEE systems has been structured as taking an unannotated block of text, such as this one:\n\nJim bought 300 shares of Acme Corp. in 2006.\nAnd producing an annotated block of text that highlights the names of entities:\n\n[Jim]Person bought 300 shares of [Acme Corp.]Organization in [2006]Time.\nIn this example, a person name consisting of one token, a two-token company name and a temporal expression have been detected and classified.\nState-of-the-art NER systems for English produce near-human performance. For example, the best system entering MUC-7 scored 93.39% of F-measure while human annotators scored 97.60% and 96.95%.Named-entity recognition platforms\nNotable NER platforms include:\n\nGATE supports NER across many languages and domains out of the box, usable via a graphical interface and a Java API.\nOpenNLP includes rule-based and statistical named-entity recognition.\nSpaCy features fast statistical NER as well as an open-source named-entity visualizer.\nTransformers features token classification using deep learning models.Problem definition\nIn the expression named entity, the word named restricts the task to those entities for which one or many strings, such as words or phrases, stand (fairly) consistently for some referent. This is closely related to rigid designators, as defined by Kripke, although in practice NER deals with many names and referents that are not philosophically \"rigid\". For instance, the automotive company created by Henry Ford in 1903 can be referred to as Ford or Ford Motor Company, although \"Ford\" can refer to many other entities as well (see Ford). Rigid designators include proper names as well as terms for certain biological species and substances, but exclude pronouns (such as \"it\"; see coreference resolution), descriptions that pick out a referent by its properties (see also De dicto and de re), and names for kinds of things as opposed to individuals (for example \"Bank\").\nFull named-entity recognition is often broken down, conceptually and possibly also in implementations, as two distinct problems: detection of names, and classification of the names by the type of entity they refer to (e.g. person, organization, or location).\nThe first phase is typically simplified to a segmentation problem: names are defined to be contiguous spans of tokens, with no nesting, so that \"Bank of America\" is a single name, disregarding the fact that inside this name, the substring \"America\" is itself a name. This segmentation problem is formally similar to chunking. The second phase requires choosing an ontology by which to organize categories of things.\nTemporal expressions and some numerical expressions (e.g., money, percentages, etc.) may also be considered as named entities in the context of the NER task. While some instances of these types are good examples of rigid designators (e.g., the year 2001) there are also many invalid ones (e.g., I take my vacations in \u201cJune\u201d). In the first case, the year 2001 refers to the 2001st year of the Gregorian calendar. In the second case, the month June may refer to the month of an undefined year (past June, next June, every June, etc.). It is arguable that the definition of named entity is loosened in such cases for practical reasons. The definition of the term named entity is therefore not strict and often has to be explained in the context in which it is used.\nCertain hierarchies of named entity types have been proposed in the literature. BBN categories, proposed in 2002, are used for question answering and consists of 29 types and 64 subtypes. Sekine's extended hierarchy, proposed in 2002, is made of 200 subtypes. More recently, in 2011 Ritter used a hierarchy based on common Freebase entity types in ground-breaking experiments on NER over social media text.Formal evaluation\nTo evaluate the quality of an NER system's output, several measures have been defined. The usual measures are called precision, recall, and F1 score. However, several issues remain in just how to calculate those values.\nThese statistical measures work reasonably well for the obvious cases of finding or missing a real entity exactly; and for finding a non-entity. However, NER can fail in many other ways, many of which are arguably \"partially correct\", and should not be counted as complete success or failures. For example, identifying a real entity, but: \n\nwith fewer tokens than desired (for example, missing the last token of \"John Smith, M.D.\")\nwith more tokens than desired (for example, including the first word of \"The University of MD\")\npartitioning adjacent entities differently (for example, treating \"Smith, Jones Robinson\" as 2 vs. 3 entities)\nassigning it a completely wrong type (for example, calling a personal name an organization)\nassigning it a related but inexact type (for example, \"substance\" vs. \"drug\", or \"school\" vs. \"organization\")\ncorrectly identifying an entity, when what the user wanted was a smaller- or larger-scope entity (for example, identifying \"James Madison\" as a personal name, when it's part of \"James Madison University\"). Some NER systems impose the restriction that entities may never overlap or nest, which means that in some cases one must make arbitrary or task-specific choices.\nOne overly simple method of measuring accuracy is merely to count what fraction of all tokens in the text were correctly or incorrectly identified as part of entity references (or as being entities of the correct type). This suffers from at least two problems: first, the vast majority of tokens in real-world text are not part of entity names, so the baseline accuracy (always predict \"not an entity\") is extravagantly high, typically >90%; and second, mispredicting the full span of an entity name is not properly penalized (finding only a person's first name when his last name follows might be scored as \u00bd accuracy).\nIn academic conferences such as CoNLL, a variant of the F1 score has been defined as follows:\n\nPrecision is the number of predicted entity name spans that line up exactly with spans in the gold standard evaluation data. I.e. when [Person Hans] [Person Blick] is predicted but [Person Hans Blick] was required, precision for the predicted name is zero. Precision is then averaged over all predicted entity names.\nRecall is similarly the number of names in the gold standard that appear at exactly the same location in the predictions.\nF1 score is the harmonic mean of these two.\nIt follows from the above definition that any prediction that misses a single token, includes a spurious token, or has the wrong class, is a hard error and does not contribute positively to either precision or recall. Thus, this measure may be said to be pessimistic: it can be the case that many \"errors\" are close to correct, and might be adequate for a given purpose. For example, one system might always omit titles such as \"Ms.\" or \"Ph.D.\", but be compared to a system or ground-truth data that expects titles to be included. In that case, every such name is treated as an error. Because of such issues, it is important actually to examine the kinds of errors, and decide how important they are given one's goals and requirements.\nEvaluation models based on a token-by-token matching have been proposed. Such models may be given partial credit for overlapping matches (such as using the Intersection over Union criterion). They allow a finer grained evaluation and comparison of extraction systems.Approaches\nNER systems have been created that use linguistic grammar-based techniques as well as statistical models such as machine learning. Hand-crafted grammar-based systems typically obtain better precision, but at the cost of lower recall and months of work by experienced computational linguists. Statistical NER systems typically require a large amount of manually annotated training data. Semisupervised approaches have been suggested to avoid part of the annotation effort.\nMany different classifier types have been used to perform machine-learned NER, with conditional random fields being a typical choice.Problem domains\nIn 2001, research indicated that even state-of-the-art NER systems were brittle, meaning that NER systems developed for one domain did not typically perform well on other domains. Considerable effort is involved in tuning NER systems to perform well in a new domain; this is true for both rule-based and trainable statistical systems.\nEarly work in NER systems in the 1990s was aimed primarily at extraction from journalistic articles. Attention then turned to processing of military dispatches and reports. Later stages of the automatic content extraction (ACE) evaluation also included several types of informal text styles, such as weblogs and text transcripts from conversational telephone speech conversations. Since about 1998, there has been a great deal of interest in entity identification in the molecular biology, bioinformatics, and medical natural language processing communities.  The most common entity of interest in that domain has been names of genes and gene products. There has been also considerable interest in the recognition of chemical entities and drugs in the context of the CHEMDNER\ncompetition, with 27 teams participating in this task.Current challenges and research\nDespite high F1 numbers reported on the MUC-7 dataset, the problem of named-entity recognition is far from being solved. The main efforts are directed to reducing the annotations labor by employing semi-supervised learning, robust performance across domains and scaling up to fine-grained entity types. In recent years, many projects have turned to crowdsourcing, which is a promising solution to obtain high-quality aggregate human judgments for supervised and semi-supervised machine learning approaches to NER. Another challenging task is devising models to deal with linguistically complex contexts such as Twitter and search queries.\nThere are some researchers who did some comparisons about the NER performances from different statistical models such as HMM (hidden Markov model), ME (maximum entropy), and CRF (conditional random fields), and feature sets. And some researchers recently proposed graph-based semi-supervised learning model for language specific NER tasks.\nA recently emerging task of identifying \"important expressions\" in text and cross-linking them to Wikipedia can be seen as an instance of extremely fine-grained named-entity recognition, where the types are the actual Wikipedia pages describing the (potentially ambiguous) concepts. Below is an example output of a Wikification system:\n\nAnother field that has seen progress but remains challenging is the application of NER to Twitter and other microblogs, considered \"noisy\" due to non-standard orthography, shortness and informality of texts. NER challenges in English Tweets have been organized by research communities to compare performances of various approaches, such as bidirectional LSTMs, Learning-to-Search, or CRFs.See also\nControlled vocabulary\nCoreference resolution\nEntity linking (aka named entity normalization, entity disambiguation)\nInformation extraction\nKnowledge extraction\nOnomastics\nRecord linkage\nSmart tag (Microsoft)\n\n\n== References ==", "result": "# Named-entity recognition\n\nNamed-entity recognition (NER), also known as entity identification, entity chunking, or entity extraction, is the task of identifying and classifying named entities, such as persons, organizations, locations, expressions of times, quantities, monetary values, percentages, or any other kind of expression of a specific domain into pre-defined categories.\n\nA named entity recognition system processes unstructured text and returns a set of predefined entities. For example, given the sentence \"I bought 2 shares of Apple Inc. for $5 each,\" a named-entity recognition system would return a list of entities including \"Apple Inc.\" as an organization, \"2\" as a quantity, \"$5\" as a monetary value, and so on. A named-entity recognition system generally transforms an unannotated text into an annotated text.\n\nState-of-the-art systems for English perform better than humans in terms of F-measure (F1-score) on the MUC-7 evaluation dataset, which contains 500 news stories.\n\nNamed-entity recognition is a subtask of information extraction. Other subtasks include relation extraction, semantic role labeling, and semantic parsing.\n\nNamed-entity recognition platforms\n\n* GATE (General Architecture for Text Engineering) supports NER in multiple languages and domains. It has a graphical interface and a Java API.\n* OpenNLP provides a rule-based and statistical NER. It can be integrated into any Java application via a Java API.\n* SpaCy provides a fast statistical NER and an open-source named-entity visualizer.\n\nProblem definition\n\nThe term \"named\" in the context of named-entity recognition is crucial. Named entities are rigid designators, whereas non-named entities are not. For example, the name of a person is always John Smith, but a person may be called John or Smith depending on the context. Therefore, named-entity recognition is the task of recognizing named entities in the text. There are two phases of named-entity recognition. In the first phase, we detect the names, which is a simple segmentation problem. In the second phase, we classify the names into categories. For example, we may want to classify all names of people into one category, all names of places into another category, and so on. There are many categories of named entities, such as persons, organizations, locations, quantities, monetary values, times, and so on.\n\nTemporal and numerical expressions are treated similarly to named entities. For example, 12/12/12 may be treated as a date, a monetary value, or a time, depending on the context. Similarly, 12:12 may be treated as a time, a quantity, or a location, depending on the context.\n\nFor example, the following sentence contains six named entities: \"John Smith went to New York yesterday and bought 12 shares of Microsoft Inc.\"\n\n* John Smith: Person\n* New York: Location\n* Microsoft Inc.: Organization\n* Yesterday: Time\n* 12: Quantity\n* Share: Expression\n\nIn this example, we can see that the last word, share, is an expression, but it is not a named entity. We can also see that the first four words are named entities, but they are not necessarily important to the meaning of the sentence.\n\nFormal evaluation\n\nNamed-entity recognition systems are evaluated based on precision, recall, and F1 score. Precision is the ratio of correctly identified entities to the total number of identified entities. Recall is the ratio of correctly identified entities to the total number of actual entities. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. F1 score is used because precision and recall are usually inversely proportional to each other.\n\nThere are several challenges in calculating precision and recall for named-entity recognition. First, there are partial correctness problems. For example, if a named-entity recognition system identifies a token as a part of a named entity, but it is not a part of the named entity, then it is considered partially correct. However, it is hard to calculate precision and recall for partially correct answers. Second, there are missing and extra tokens problems. For example, if a named-entity recognition system misses a token that is actually part of a named entity, then it is considered incorrect. If a named-entity recognition system identifies a token as a part of a named entity, but it is not a part of the named entity, then it is considered incorrect. These problems make it difficult to evaluate the performance of named-entity recognition systems.\n\nSeveral alternatives to precision and recall have been proposed. For example, instead of counting the number of correctly identified entities, we can count the number of tokens that were correctly identified as parts of named entities. Another alternative is to use semantic similarity measures, such as cosine similarity, to measure the degree of similarity between the predicted named entities and the actual named entities. These alternatives are useful in cases where precision and recall are not sufficient.\n\nApproaches\n\nThere are several approaches to named-entity recognition, such as linguistic grammar-based techniques and statistical models (machine learning). Grammar-based NER systems are more precise but have lower recall. They require extensive time and expertise to develop. Statistical NER systems, on the other hand, are less precise but have higher recall. They require large, manually annotated datasets for training. Semisupervised learning reduces the annotation effort compared to fully supervised methods.\n\nProblem domains\n\nNER systems are brittle to domain changes. That is, a system trained on one domain performs poorly on another domain. It takes effort to adapt and tune NER systems for new domains. Rule-based systems are easier to adapt than statistical systems.\n\nIn the 1990s, NER systems were applied to journalistic articles. Later, the focus shifted to other areas, such as military dispatches and reports. Later still, informal text styles were added to the ACE evaluation, such as weblogs and conversational telephone speech transcripts.\n\nSince 1998, the molecular biology and bioinformatics communities have shown interest in entity identification. Entities targeted include gene and gene product names, chemical names, species names, protein names, and protein modifications.\n\nIn medical natural language processing, named-entity recognition is a subtask of information extraction.\n\nCurrent challenges and research\n\nDespite high F1 scores on existing datasets, such as MUC-7, there are still many challenges in NER. One challenge is to develop NER systems that can generalize across different domains. Another challenge is to reduce the annotation labor. Semi-supervised learning is a promising direction for reducing annotation labor. Crowdsourcing is another direction for improving NER systems. Crowdsourcing allows us to gather high-quality annotations and human judgments. Domain adaptation is another direction for improving robustness of NER systems. NER systems are brittle to domain changes. Domain adaptation allows us to train NER systems for new domains. Finally, there is a need to develop NER systems that can handle low-resource languages. Low-resource languages are languages with little or no annotated data. Developing NER systems for low-resource languages is challenging due to lack of annotated data.\n\nSee also\n\n* Controlled vocabulary\n* Disambiguation (semantics)\n* Linkage (data mining)\n* Named-entity disambiguation\n* Named-entity linking\n* Named-entity tagging\n* Named-entity typing\n* Named-entity recognition\n* Semantic indexing\n* Semantic role labeling\n* Semantic search\n* Semantic segmentation\n* Text chunking\n* Text parsing\n* Text segmentation\n* Word sense disambiguation\n"}, {"instruction": "You are an AI editor writing a complete Wikipedia article that adheres to Wikipedia's content standards.

Modern models can be fine-tuned for specific tasks or guided by prompt engineering. These models acquire predictive power regarding syntax, semantics, and ontologies inherent in human language corpora, but they also inherit inaccuracies and biases present in the data they are trained in.History\nBefore 2017, there were a few language models that were large as compared to capacities then available. In the 1990s, the IBM alignment models pioneered statistical language modelling. A smoothed n-gram model in 2001 trained on 0.3 billion words achieved state-of-the-art perplexity at the time. In the 2000s, as Internet use became prevalent, some researchers constructed Internet-scale language datasets (\"web as corpus\"), upon which they trained statistical language models. In 2009, in most language processing tasks, statistical language models dominated over symbolic language models because they can usefully ingest large datasets.\n\nAfter neural networks became dominant in image processing around 2012, they were applied to language modelling as well. Google converted its translation service to Neural Machine Translation in 2016. Because it preceded the existence of transformers, it was done by seq2seq deep LSTM networks.\nAt the 2017 NeurIPS conference, Google researchers introduced the transformer architecture in their landmark paper \"Attention Is All You Need\". This paper's goal was to improve upon 2014 seq2seq technology, and was based mainly on the attention mechanism developed by Bahdanau et al. in 2014. The following year in 2018, BERT was introduced and quickly became \"ubiquitous\". Though the original transformer has both encoder and decoder blocks, BERT is an encoder-only model. Academic and research usage of BERT began to decline in 2023, following rapid improvements in the abilities of decoder-only models (such as GPT) to solve tasks via prompting.\nAlthough decoder-only GPT-1 was introduced in 2018, it was GPT-2 in 2019 that caught widespread attention because OpenAI at first deemed it too powerful to release publicly, out of fear of malicious use. GPT-3 in 2020 went a step further and as of 2024 is available only via API with no offering of downloading the model to execute locally. But it was the 2022 consumer-facing browser-based ChatGPT that captured the imaginations of the general population and caused some media hype and online buzz. The 2023 GPT-4 was praised for its increased accuracy and as a \"holy grail\" for its multimodal capabilities. OpenAI did not reveal the high-level architecture and the number of parameters of GPT-4. The release of ChatGPT led to an uptick in LLM usage across several research subfields of computer science, including robotics, software engineering, and societal impact work. In 2024 OpenAI released the reasoning model OpenAI o1, which generates long chains of thought before returning a final answer.\nCompeting language models have for the most part been attempting to equal the GPT series, at least in terms of number of parameters.\nSince 2022, source-available models have been gaining popularity, especially at first with BLOOM and LLaMA, though both have restrictions on the field of use. Mistral AI's models Mistral 7B and Mixtral 8x7b have the more permissive Apache License. In January 2025, DeepSeek released DeepSeek R1, a 671-billion-parameter open-weight model that performs comparably to OpenAI o1 but at a much lower cost.\nSince 2023, many LLMs have been trained to be multimodal, having the ability to also process or generate other types of data, such as images or audio. These LLMs are also called large multimodal models (LMMs).\nAs of 2024, the largest and most capable models are all based on the transformer architecture. Some recent implementations are based on other architectures, such as recurrent neural network variants and Mamba (a state space model).Dataset preprocessing\nTokenization\nAs machine learning algorithms process numbers rather than text, the text must be converted to numbers. In the first step, a vocabulary is decided upon, then integer indices are arbitrarily but uniquely assigned to each vocabulary entry, and finally, an embedding is associated to the integer index. Algorithms include byte-pair encoding (BPE) and WordPiece. There are also special tokens serving as control characters, such as [MASK] for masked-out token (as used in BERT), and [UNK] (\"unknown\") for characters not appearing in the vocabulary. Also, some special symbols are used to denote special text formatting. For example, \"\u0120\" denotes a preceding whitespace in RoBERTa and GPT. \"##\" denotes continuation of a preceding word in BERT.\nFor example, the BPE tokenizer used by GPT-3 (Legacy) would split tokenizer: texts -> series of numerical \"tokens\" as\n\nTokenization also compresses the datasets. Because LLMs generally require input to be an array that is not jagged, the shorter texts must be \"padded\" until they match the length of the longest one. How many tokens are, on average, needed per word depends on the language of the dataset.BPE\nAs an example, consider a tokenizer based on byte-pair encoding. In the first step, all unique characters (including blanks and punctuation marks) are treated as an initial set of n-grams (i.e. initial set of uni-grams). Successively the most frequent pair of adjacent characters is merged into a bi-gram and all instances of the pair are replaced by it. All occurrences of adjacent pairs of (previously merged) n-grams that most frequently occur together are then again merged into even lengthier n-gram, until a vocabulary of prescribed size is obtained (in case of GPT-3, the size is 50257). After a tokenizer is trained, any text can be tokenized by it, as long as it does not contain characters not appearing in the initial-set of uni-grams.Problems\nA token vocabulary based on the frequencies extracted from mainly English corpora uses as few tokens as possible for an average English word. However, an average word in another language encoded by such an English-optimized tokenizer is split into a suboptimal amount of tokens. GPT-2 tokenizer can use up to 15 times more tokens per word for some languages, for example for the Shan language from Myanmar. Even more widespread languages such as Portuguese and German have \"a premium of 50%\" compared to English.\nGreedy tokenization also causes subtle problems with text completion.Dataset cleaning\nIn the context of training LLMs, datasets are typically cleaned by removing low-quality, duplicated, or toxic data. Cleaned datasets can increase training efficiency and lead to improved downstream performance. A trained LLM can be used to clean datasets for training a further LLM.\nWith the increasing proportion of LLM-generated content on the web, data cleaning in the future may include filtering out such content. LLM-generated content can pose a problem if the content is similar to human text (making filtering difficult) but of lower quality (degrading performance of models trained on it).Synthetic data\nTraining of largest language models might need more linguistic data than naturally available, or that the naturally occurring data is of insufficient quality. In these cases, synthetic data might be used. Microsoft's Phi series of LLMs is trained on textbook-like data generated by another LLM.Training and architecture\nReinforcement learning from human feedback\nReinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) through algorithms, such as proximal policy optimization, is used to further fine-tune a model based on a dataset of human preferences.Instruction tuning\nUsing \"self-instruct\" approaches, LLMs have been able to bootstrap correct responses, replacing any naive responses, starting from human-generated corrections of a few cases. For example, in the instruction \"Write an essay about the main themes represented in Hamlet,\" an initial naive completion might be \"If you submit the essay after March 17, your grade will be reduced by 10% for each day of delay,\" based on the frequency of this textual sequence in the corpus.Mixture of experts\nThe largest LLM may be too expensive to train and use directly. For such models, mixture of experts (MoE) can be applied, a line of research pursued by Google researchers since 2017 to train models reaching up to 1 trillion parameters.Prompt engineering, attention mechanism, and context window\nMost results previously achievable only by (costly) fine-tuning, can be achieved through prompt engineering, although limited to the scope of a single conversation (more precisely, limited to the scope of a context window).\n\nIn order to find out which tokens are relevant to each other within the scope of the context window, the attention mechanism calculates \"soft\" weights for each token, more precisely for its embedding, by using multiple attention heads, each with its own \"relevance\" for calculating its own soft weights. For example, the small (i.e. 117M parameter sized) GPT-2 model has had twelve attention heads and a context window of only 1k tokens. In its medium version it has 345M parameters and contains 24 layers, each with 12 attention heads. For the training with gradient descent a batch size of 512 was utilized.\nThe largest models, such as Google's Gemini 1.5, presented in February 2024, can have a context window sized up to 1 million (context window of 10 million was also \"successfully tested\"). Other models with large context windows includes Anthropic's Claude 2.1, with a context window of up to 200k tokens. Note that this maximum refers to the number of input tokens and that the maximum number of output tokens differs from the input and is often smaller. For example, the GPT-4 Turbo model has a maximum output of 4096 tokens.\nLength of a conversation that the model can take into account when generating its next answer is limited by the size of a context window, as well. If the length of a conversation, for example with ChatGPT, is longer than its context window, only the parts inside the context window are taken into account when generating the next answer, or the model needs to apply some algorithm to summarize the too distant parts of conversation.\nThe shortcomings of making a context window larger include higher computational cost and possibly diluting the focus on local context, while making it smaller can cause a model to miss an important long-range dependency. Balancing them is a matter of experimentation and domain-specific considerations.\nA model may be pre-trained either to predict how the segment continues, or what is missing in the segment, given a segment from its training dataset. It can be either\n\nautoregressive (i.e. predicting how the segment continues, as GPTs do): for example given a segment \"I like to eat\", the model predicts \"ice cream\", or \"sushi\".\n\"masked\" (i.e. filling in the parts missing from the segment, the way \"BERT\" does it): for example, given a segment \"I like to [__] [__] cream\", the model predicts that \"eat\" and \"ice\" are missing.\nModels may be trained on auxiliary tasks which test their understanding of the data distribution, such as Next Sentence Prediction (NSP), in which pairs of sentences are presented and the model must predict whether they appear consecutively in the training corpus. During training, regularization loss is also used to stabilize training. However regularization loss is usually not used during testing and evaluation.Infrastructure\nSubstantial infrastructure is necessary for training the largest models.Training cost\nThe qualifier \"large\" in \"large language model\" is inherently vague, as there is no definitive threshold for the number of parameters required to qualify as \"large\". As time goes on, what was previously considered \"large\" may evolve. GPT-1 of 2018 is usually considered the first LLM, even though it has only 0.117 billion parameters. The tendency towards larger models is visible in the list of large language models.\nAs technology advanced, large sums have been invested in increasingly large models. For example, training of the GPT-2 (i.e. a 1.5-billion-parameters model) in 2019 cost $50,000, while training of the PaLM (i.e. a 540-billion-parameters model) in 2022 cost $8 million, and Megatron-Turing NLG 530B (in 2021) cost around $11 million.\nFor Transformer-based LLM, training cost is much higher than inference cost. It costs 6 FLOPs per parameter to train on one token, whereas it costs 1 to 2 FLOPs per parameter to infer on one token.Tool use\nThere are certain tasks that, in principle, cannot be solved by any LLM, at least not without the use of external tools or additional software. An example of such a task is responding to the user's input '354 * 139 = ', provided that the LLM has not already encountered a continuation of this calculation in its training corpus. In such cases, the LLM needs to resort to running program code that calculates the result, which can then be included in its response.: Another example is \"What is the time now? It is \", where a separate program interpreter would need to execute a code to get system time on the computer, so that the LLM can include it in its reply. This basic strategy can be sophisticated with multiple attempts of generated programs, and other sampling strategies.\nGenerally, in order to get an LLM to use tools, one must fine-tune it for tool-use. If the number of tools is finite, then fine-tuning may be done just once. If the number of tools can grow arbitrarily, as with online API services, then the LLM can be fine-tuned to be able to read API documentation and call API correctly.\nRetrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is another approach that enhances LLMs by integrating them with document retrieval systems. Given a query, a document retriever is called to retrieve the most relevant documents. This is usually done by encoding the query and the documents into vectors, then finding the documents with vectors (usually stored in a vector database) most similar to the vector of the query. The LLM then generates an output based on both the query and context included from the retrieved documents.Agency\nAn LLM is typically not an autonomous agent by itself, as it lacks the ability to interact with dynamic environments, recall past behaviors, and plan future actions, but can be transformed into one by integrating modules like profiling, memory, planning, and action.\nThe ReAct pattern, a portmanteau of \"Reason + Act\", constructs an agent out of an LLM, using the LLM as a planner. The LLM is prompted to \"think out loud\". Specifically, the language model is prompted with a textual description of the environment, a goal, a list of possible actions, and a record of the actions and observations so far. It generates one or more thoughts before generating an action, which is then executed in the environment. The linguistic description of the environment given to the LLM planner can even be the LaTeX code of a paper describing the environment.\nIn the DEPS (\"Describe, Explain, Plan and Select\") method, an LLM is first connected to the visual world via image descriptions, then it is prompted to produce plans for complex tasks and behaviors based on its pretrained knowledge and environmental feedback it receives.\nThe Reflexion method constructs an agent that learns over multiple episodes. At the end of each episode, the LLM is given the record of the episode, and prompted to think up \"lessons learned\", which would help it perform better at a subsequent episode. These \"lessons learned\" are given to the agent in the subsequent episodes.\nMonte Carlo tree search can use an LLM as rollout heuristic. When a programmatic world model is not available, an LLM can also be prompted with a description of the environment to act as world model.\nFor open-ended exploration, an LLM can be used to score observations for their \"interestingness\", which can be used as a reward signal to guide a normal (non-LLM) reinforcement learning agent. Alternatively, it can propose increasingly difficult tasks for curriculum learning. Instead of outputting individual actions, an LLM planner can also construct \"skills\", or functions for complex action sequences. The skills can be stored and later invoked, allowing increasing levels of abstraction in planning.\nLLM-powered agents can keep a long-term memory of its previous contexts, and the memory can be retrieved in the same way as Retrieval Augmented Generation. Multiple such agents can interact socially.Compression\nTypically, LLMs are trained with single- or half-precision floating point numbers (float32 and float16). One float16 has 16 bits, or 2 bytes, and so one billion parameters require 2 gigabytes. The largest models typically have 100 billion parameters, requiring 200 gigabytes to load, which places them outside the range of most consumer electronics.\nPost-training quantization aims to decrease the space requirement by lowering precision of the parameters of a trained model, while preserving most of its performance. The simplest form of quantization simply truncates all numbers to a given number of bits. It can be improved by using a different quantization codebook per layer. Further improvement can be done by applying different precisions to different parameters, with higher precision for particularly important parameters (\"outlier weights\"). See the visual guide to quantization by Maarten Grootendorst for a visual depiction.\nWhile quantized models are typically frozen, and only pre-quantized models are fine-tuned, quantized models can still be fine-tuned.Multimodality\nMultimodality means \"having several modalities\", and a \"modality\" refers to a type of input or output, such as video, image, audio, text, proprioception, etc. There have been many AI models trained specifically to ingest one modality and output another modality, such as AlexNet for image to label, visual question answering for image-text to text, and speech recognition for speech to text.\nA common method to create multimodal models out of an LLM is to \"tokenize\" the output of a trained encoder. Concretely, one can construct an LLM that can understand images as follows: take a trained LLM, and take a trained image encoder \n  \n    \n      \n        E\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle E}\n  \n. Make a small multilayered perceptron \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f}\n  \n, so that for any image \n  \n    \n      \n        y\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle y}\n  \n, the post-processed vector \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        (\n        E\n        (\n        y\n        )\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f(E(y))}\n  \n has the same dimensions as an encoded token. That is an \"image token\". Then, one can interleave text tokens and image tokens. The compound model is then fine-tuned on an image-text dataset. This basic construction can be applied with more sophistication to improve the model. The image encoder may be frozen to improve stability.\nFlamingo demonstrated the effectiveness of the tokenization method, finetuning a pair of pretrained language model and image encoder to perform better on visual question answering than models trained from scratch. Google PaLM model was fine-tuned into a multimodal model PaLM-E using the tokenization method, and applied to robotic control. LLaMA models have also been turned multimodal using the tokenization method, to allow image inputs, and video inputs.\nGPT-4 can use both text and image as inputs (although the vision component was not released to the public until GPT-4V); Google DeepMind's Gemini is also multimodal.  Mistral introduced its own multimodel Pixtral 12B model in September 2024.Reasoning\nIn late 2024, a new direction emerged in LLM development with models specifically designed for complex reasoning tasks. These \"reasoning models\" were trained to spend more time generating step-by-step solutions before providing final answers, similar to human problem-solving processes.\nOpenAI introduced this trend with their o1 model in September 2024, followed by o3 in December 2024. These models showed significant improvements in mathematics, science, and coding tasks compared to traditional LLMs. For example, on International Mathematics Olympiad qualifying exam problems, GPT-4o achieved 13% accuracy while o1 reached 83%.\nIn January 2025, the Chinese company DeepSeek released DeepSeek-R1, a 671-billion-parameter open-weight reasoning model that achieved comparable performance to OpenAI's o1 while being significantly more cost-effective to operate. Unlike proprietary models from OpenAI, DeepSeek-R1's open-weight nature allowed researchers to study and build upon the algorithm, though its training data remained private.\nThese reasoning models typically require more computational resources per query compared to traditional LLMs, as they perform more extensive processing to work through problems step-by-step. However, they have shown superior capabilities in domains requiring structured logical thinking, such as mathematics, scientific research, and computer programming.\nEfforts to reduce or compensate for hallucinations have employed automated reasoning, RAG (retrieval-augmented generation), fine-tuning, and other methods.Properties\nScaling laws\nThe performance of an LLM after pretraining largely depends on the:\n\ncost of pretraining \n  \n    \n      \n        C\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle C}\n  \n (the total amount of compute used),\nsize of the artificial neural network itself, such as number of parameters \n  \n    \n      \n        N\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle N}\n  \n (i.e. amount of neurons in its layers, amount of weights between them and biases),\nsize of its pretraining dataset (i.e. number of tokens in corpus, \n  \n    \n      \n        D\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle D}\n  \n).\n\"Scaling laws\" are empirical statistical laws that predict LLM performance based on such factors. One particular scaling law (\"Chinchilla scaling\") for LLM autoregressively trained for one epoch, with a log-log learning rate schedule, states that:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            {\n            \n              \n                \n                  C\n                  =\n                  \n                    C\n                    \n                      0\n                    \n                  \n                  N\n                  D\n                \n              \n              \n                \n                  L\n                  =\n                  \n                    \n                      A\n                      \n                        N\n                        \n                          \u03b1\n                        \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                  +\n                  \n                    \n                      B\n                      \n                        D\n                        \n                          \u03b2\n                        \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                  +\n                  \n                    L\n                    \n                      0\n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\begin{cases}C=C_{0}ND\\\\[6pt]L={\\frac {A}{N^{\\alpha }}}+{\\frac {B}{D^{\\beta }}}+L_{0}\\end{cases}}}\n  \n where the variables are\n\n  \n    \n      \n        C\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle C}\n  \n is the cost of training the model, in FLOPs.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        N\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle N}\n  \n is the number of parameters in the model.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        D\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle D}\n  \n is the number of tokens in the training set.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        L\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle L}\n  \n is the average negative log-likelihood loss per token (nats/token), achieved by the trained LLM on the test dataset.\nand the statistical hyper-parameters are\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          C\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n        =\n        6\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle C_{0}=6}\n  \n, meaning that it costs 6 FLOPs per parameter to train on one token.

However, this linearity may be punctuated by \"break(s)\" in the scaling law, where the slope of the line changes abruptly, and where larger models acquire \"emergent abilities\". They arise from the complex interaction of the model's components and are not explicitly programmed or designed. \nFurthermore, recent research has demonstrated that AI systems, including large language models, can employ heuristic reasoning akin to human cognition. They balance between exhaustive logical processing and the use of cognitive shortcuts (heuristics), adapting their reasoning strategies to optimize between accuracy and effort. This behavior aligns with principles of resource-rational human cognition, as discussed in classical theories of bounded rationality and dual-process theory.\nOne of the emergent abilities is in-context learning from example demonstrations. In-context learning is involved in tasks, such as:\n\nreported arithmetics\ndecoding the International Phonetic Alphabet\nunscrambling a word's letters\ndisambiguating word-in-context datasets\nconverting spatial words\ncardinal directions (for example, replying \"northeast\" in response to a 3x3 grid of 8 zeros and a 1 in the top-right), color terms represented in text.\nchain-of-thought prompting: In a 2022 research paper, chain-of-thought prompting only improved the performance for models that had at least 62B. Smaller models perform better when prompted to answer immediately, without chain of thought.\nidentifying offensive content in paragraphs of Hinglish (a combination of Hindi and English), and generating a similar English equivalent of Kiswahili proverbs.\nSchaeffer et. al. argue that the emergent abilities are not unpredictably acquired, but predictably acquired according to a smooth scaling law. The authors considered a toy statistical model of an LLM solving multiple-choice questions, and showed that this statistical model, modified to account for other types of tasks, applies to these tasks as well.\nLet \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x}\n  \n be the number of parameter count, and \n  \n    \n      \n        y\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle y}\n  \n be the performance of the model.Interpretation\nLarge language models by themselves are black boxes, and it is not clear how they can perform linguistic tasks. Similarly, it is unclear if or how LLMs should be viewed as models of the human brain and/or human mind.\nVarious techniques have been developed to enhance the transparency and interpretability of LLMs. Mechanistic interpretability aims to reverse-engineer LLMs by discovering symbolic algorithms that approximate the inference performed by an LLM. In recent years, sparse coding models such as sparse autoencoders, transcoders, and crosscoders have emerged as promising tools for identifying interpretable features.Studying a replacement model\nTranscoders, which are more interpretable than transformers, have been utilized to develop \u201creplacement models.\u201d In one such study involving the mechanistic interpretation of writing a rhyming poem by an LLM, it was shown that although they are believed to simply predict the next token, they can, in fact, plan ahead.Explainability\nA related concept is AI explainability, which focuses on understanding how an AI model arrives at a given result. Techniques such as partial dependency plots, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), and feature importance assessments allow researchers to visualize and understand the contributions of various input features to the model's predictions. These methods help ensure that AI models make decisions based on relevant and fair criteria, enhancing trust and accountability.\nBy integrating these techniques, researchers and practitioners can gain deeper insights into the operations of LLMs, fostering trust and facilitating the responsible deployment of these powerful models.\nIn another example, the authors trained small transformers on modular arithmetic addition. The resulting models were reverse-engineered, and it turned out they used discrete Fourier transform.Understanding and intelligence\nNLP researchers were evenly split when asked, in a 2022 survey, whether (untuned) LLMs \"could (ever) understand natural language in some nontrivial sense\". Proponents of \"LLM understanding\" believe that some LLM abilities, such as mathematical reasoning, imply an ability to \"understand\" certain concepts. A Microsoft team argued in 2023 that GPT-4 \"can solve novel and difficult tasks that span mathematics, coding, vision, medicine, law, psychology and more\" and that GPT-4 \"could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence system\": \"Can one reasonably say that a system that passes exams for software engineering candidates is not really intelligent?\" Ilya Sutskever argues that predicting the next word sometimes involves reasoning and deep insights, for example if the LLM has to predict the name of the criminal in an unknown detective novel after processing the entire story leading up to the revelation. Some researchers characterize LLMs as \"alien intelligence\". For example, Conjecture CEO Connor Leahy considers untuned LLMs to be like inscrutable alien \"Shoggoths\", and believes that RLHF tuning creates a \"smiling facade\" obscuring the inner workings of the LLM: \"If you don't push it too far, the smiley face stays on. But then you give it [an unexpected] prompt, and suddenly you see this massive underbelly of insanity, of weird thought processes and clearly non-human understanding.\"\nIn contrast, some skeptics of LLM understanding believe that existing LLMs are \"simply remixing and recombining existing writing\", a phenomenon known as stochastic parrot, or they point to the deficits existing LLMs continue to have in prediction skills, reasoning skills, agency, and explainability. For example, GPT-4 has natural deficits in planning and in real-time learning. Generative LLMs have been observed to confidently assert claims of fact which do not seem to be justified by their training data, a phenomenon which has been termed \"hallucination\". Specifically, hallucinations in the context of LLMs correspond to the generation of text or responses that seem syntactically sound, fluent, and natural but are factually incorrect, nonsensical, or unfaithful to the provided source input. Neuroscientist Terrence Sejnowski has argued that \"The diverging opinions of experts on the intelligence of LLMs suggests that our old ideas based on natural intelligence are inadequate\".\nThe matter of LLM's exhibiting intelligence or understanding has two main aspects \u2013 the first is how to model thought and language in a computer system, and the second is how to enable the computer system to generate human like language. These aspects of language as a model of cognition have been developed in the field of cognitive linguistics. American linguist George Lakoff presented Neural Theory of Language (NTL) as a computational basis for using language as a model of learning tasks and understanding. The NTL Model outlines how specific neural structures of the human brain shape the nature of thought and language and in turn what are the computational properties of such neural systems that can be applied to model thought and language in a computer system. After a framework for modeling language in a computer systems was established, the focus shifted to establishing frameworks for computer systems to generate language with acceptable grammar. In his 2014 book titled The Language Myth: Why Language Is Not An Instinct, British cognitive linguist and digital communication technologist Vyvyan Evans mapped out the role of probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG) in enabling NLP to model cognitive patterns and generate human like language.Evaluation\nPerplexity\nThe canonical measure of the performance of an LLM is its perplexity on a given text corpus. Perplexity measures how well a model predicts the contents of a dataset; the higher the likelihood the model assigns to the dataset, the lower the perplexity. In mathematical terms, perplexity is the exponential of the average negative log likelihood per token.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        log\n        \u2061\n        (\n        \n          Perplexity\n        \n        )\n        =\n        \u2212\n        \n          \n            1\n            N\n          \n        \n        \n          \u2211\n          \n            i\n            =\n            1\n          \n          \n            N\n          \n        \n        log\n        \u2061\n        (\n        Pr\n        (\n        \n          \n            token\n          \n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        \u2223\n        \n          \n            context for token\n          \n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        )\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\log({\\text{Perplexity}})=-{\\frac {1}{N}}\\sum _{i=1}^{N}\\log(\\Pr({\\text{token}}_{i}\\mid {\\text{context for token}}_{i}))}\n  \n\nHere, \n  \n    \n      \n        N\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle N}\n  \n is the number of tokens in the text corpus, and \"context for token \n  \n    \n      \n        i\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i}\n  \n\" depends on the specific type of LLM. If the LLM is autoregressive, then \"context for token \n  \n    \n      \n        i\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i}\n  \n\" is the segment of text appearing before token \n  \n    \n      \n        i\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i}\n  \n. If the LLM is masked, then \"context for token \n  \n    \n      \n        i\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i}\n  \n\" is the segment of text surrounding token \n  \n    \n      \n        i\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i}\n  \n.\nBecause language models may overfit to training data, models are usually evaluated by their perplexity on a test set. This evaluation is potentially problematic for larger models which, as they are trained on increasingly large corpora of text, are increasingly likely to inadvertently include portions of any given test set.BPW, BPC, and BPT\nIn information theory, the concept of entropy is intricately linked to perplexity, a relationship notably established by Claude Shannon. This relationship is mathematically expressed as \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          Entropy\n        \n        =\n        \n          log\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        \u2061\n        (\n        \n          Perplexity\n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\text{Entropy}}=\\log _{2}({\\text{Perplexity}})}\n  \n.\nEntropy, in this context, is commonly quantified in terms of bits per word (BPW) or bits per character (BPC), which hinges on whether the language model utilizes word-based or character-based tokenization.\nNotably, in the case of larger language models that predominantly employ sub-word tokenization, bits per token (BPT) emerges as a seemingly more appropriate measure. However, due to the variance in tokenization methods across different Large Language Models (LLMs), BPT does not serve as a reliable metric for comparative analysis among diverse models. To convert BPT into BPW, one can multiply it by the average number of tokens per word.\nIn the evaluation and comparison of language models, cross-entropy is generally the preferred metric over entropy. The underlying principle is that a lower BPW is indicative of a model's enhanced capability for compression. This, in turn, reflects the model's proficiency in making accurate predictions.Task-specific datasets and benchmarks\nA large number of testing datasets and benchmarks have also been developed to evaluate the capabilities of language models on more specific downstream tasks. Tests may be designed to evaluate a variety of capabilities, including general knowledge, bias, commonsense reasoning, and mathematical problem-solving.\nOne broad category of evaluation dataset is question answering datasets, consisting of pairs of questions and correct answers, for example, (\"Have the San Jose Sharks won the Stanley Cup?\", \"No\"). A question answering task is considered \"open book\" if the model's prompt includes text from which the expected answer can be derived (for example, the previous question could be adjoined with some text which includes the sentence \"The Sharks have advanced to the Stanley Cup finals once, losing to the Pittsburgh Penguins in 2016.\"). Otherwise, the task is considered \"closed book\", and the model must draw on knowledge retained during training. Some examples of commonly used question answering datasets include TruthfulQA, Web Questions, TriviaQA, and SQuAD.\nEvaluation datasets may also take the form of text completion, having the model select the most likely word or sentence to complete a prompt, for example: \"Alice was friends with Bob. Alice went to visit her friend, ____\".\nSome composite benchmarks have also been developed which combine a diversity of different evaluation datasets and tasks. Examples include GLUE, SuperGLUE, MMLU, BIG-bench, HELM, and HLE (Humanity's Last Exam). OpenAI has released tools for running composite benchmarks, but noted that the eval results are sensitive to the prompting method. Some public datasets contain questions that are mislabeled, ambiguous, unanswerable, or otherwise of low-quality, which can be cleaned to give more reliable benchmark scores.\nBias in LLMs may be measured through benchmarks such as CrowS-Pairs (Crowdsourced Stereotype Pairs), Stereo Set, and the more recent Parity Benchmark.  Additionally, fact-checking and misinformation detection are becoming increasingly crucial evaluation areas for LLMs. A recent study by Caramancion (2023) compared the fact-checking accuracy of prominent LLMs\u2014including OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT 3.5 and 4.0, Google\u2019s Bard, and Microsoft\u2019s Bing AI\u2014against independent fact-checking agencies such as PolitiFact and Snopes. The results demonstrated a moderate proficiency in fact verification, with GPT-4 achieving the highest accuracy at 71%, but still lagging behind human fact-checkers in contextual comprehension and nuanced reasoning. This underscores the evolving but incomplete ability of LLMs to discern fact from deception, highlighting the need for continued advancements in AI-driven fact-checking methodologies.\nIt was previously standard to report results on a heldout portion of an evaluation dataset after doing supervised fine-tuning on the remainder. It is now more common to evaluate a pre-trained model directly through prompting techniques, though researchers vary in the details of how they formulate prompts for particular tasks, particularly with respect to how many examples of solved tasks are adjoined to the prompt (i.e. the value of n in n-shot prompting).Adversarially constructed evaluations\nBecause of the rapid pace of improvement of large language models, evaluation benchmarks have suffered from short lifespans, with state of the art models quickly \"saturating\" existing benchmarks, exceeding the performance of human annotators, leading to efforts to replace or augment the benchmark with more challenging tasks. In addition, there are cases of \"shortcut learning\" wherein AIs sometimes \"cheat\" on multiple-choice tests by using statistical correlations in superficial test question wording in order to guess the correct responses, without necessarily understanding the actual question being asked.\nSome datasets have been constructed adversarially, focusing on particular problems on which extant language models seem to have unusually poor performance compared to humans. One example is the TruthfulQA dataset, a question answering dataset consisting of 817 questions which language models are susceptible to answering incorrectly by mimicking falsehoods to which they were repeatedly exposed during training. For example, an LLM may answer \"No\" to the question \"Can you teach an old dog new tricks?\" because of its exposure to the English idiom you can't teach an old dog new tricks, even though this is not literally true.\nAnother example of an adversarial evaluation dataset is Swag and its successor, HellaSwag, collections of problems in which one of multiple options must be selected to complete a text passage. The incorrect completions were generated by sampling from a language model and filtering with a set of classifiers. The resulting problems are trivial for humans but at the time the datasets were created state of the art language models had poor accuracy on them. For example:\n\nWe see a fitness center sign. We then see a man talking to the camera and sitting and laying on a exercise ball. The man...\na) demonstrates how to increase efficient exercise work by running up and down balls.\nb) moves all his arms and legs and builds up a lot of muscle.\nc) then plays the ball and we see a graphics and hedge trimming demonstration.\nd) performs sit ups while on the ball and talking.\n\nBERT selects b) as the most likely completion, though the correct answer is d).Limitations of LLM benchmarks\nBenchmarks can become outdated rapidly. Once a model attains near-perfect scores on a given benchmark, that benchmark ceases to serve as a meaningful indicator of progress. This phenomenon, known as \"benchmark saturation,\" necessitates the development of more challenging and nuanced tasks to continue advancing LLM capabilities. For instance, traditional benchmarks like HellaSwag and MMLU have seen models achieving high accuracy already.Wider impact\nIn 2023, Nature Biomedical Engineering wrote that \"it is no longer possible to accurately distinguish\" human-written text from text created by large language models, and that \"It is all but certain that general-purpose large language models will rapidly proliferate... It is a rather safe bet that they will change many industries over time.\" Goldman Sachs suggested in 2023 that generative language AI could increase global GDP by 7% in the next ten years, and could expose to automation 300 million jobs globally. Brinkmann et al. (2023) also argue that LLMs are transforming processes of cultural evolution by shaping processes of variation, transmission, and selection.Memorization and copyright\nMemorization is an emergent behavior in LLMs in which long strings of text are occasionally output verbatim from training data, contrary to typical behavior of traditional artificial neural nets. Evaluations of controlled LLM output measure the amount memorized from training data (focused on GPT-2-series models) as variously over 1% for exact duplicates or up to about 7%.\nA 2023 study showed that when ChatGPT 3.5 turbo was prompted to repeat the same word indefinitely, after a few hundreds of repetitions, it would start outputting excerpts from its training data.Security\nSome commenters expressed concern over accidental or deliberate creation of misinformation, or other forms of misuse. For example, the availability of large language models could reduce the skill-level required to commit bioterrorism; biosecurity researcher Kevin Esvelt has suggested that LLM creators should exclude from their training data papers on creating or enhancing pathogens.\nThe potential presence of \"sleeper agents\" within LLMs is another emerging security concern. These are hidden functionalities built into the model that remain dormant until triggered by a specific event or condition. Upon activation, the LLM deviates from its expected behavior to make insecure actions.\nLLM applications accessible to the public, like ChatGPT or Claude, typically incorporate safety measures designed to filter out harmful content. However, implementing these controls effectively has proven challenging. For instance, a 2023 study proposed a method for circumventing LLM safety systems. In 2025, The American Sunlight Project, a non-profit, published a study showing evidence that the so-called Pravda network, a pro-Russia propaganda aggregator, was strategically placing web content through mass publication and duplication with the intention of biasing LLM outputs. The American Sunlight Project coined this technique \"LLM grooming,\" and pointed to it as a new tool of weaponizing AI to spread disinformation and harmful content. Similarly, Yongge Wang illustrated in 2024 how a potential criminal could potentially bypass ChatGPT 4o's safety controls to obtain information on establishing a drug trafficking operation.Algorithmic bias\nWhile LLMs have shown remarkable capabilities in generating human-like text, they are susceptible to inheriting and amplifying biases present in their training data. This can manifest in skewed representations or unfair treatment of different demographics, such as those based on race, gender, language, and cultural groups. Since English data is overrepresented in current large language models' training data, it may also downplay non-English views.Stereotyping\nAI models can reinforce a wide range of stereotypes, including those based on gender, ethnicity, age, nationality, religion, or occupation. This can lead to outputs that homogenize, or unfairly generalize or caricature groups of people, sometimes in harmful or derogatory ways.\nNotably, gender bias refers to the tendency of these models to produce outputs that are unfairly prejudiced towards one gender over another. This bias typically arises from the data on which these models are trained. Large language models often assign roles and characteristics based on traditional gender norms. For example, it might associate nurses or secretaries predominantly with women and engineers or CEOs with men.Selection bias\nSelection bias refers the inherent tendency of large language models to favor certain option identifiers irrespective of the actual content of the options. This bias primarily stems from token bias\u2014that is, the model assigns a higher a priori probability to specific answer tokens (such as \u201cA\u201d) when generating responses. As a result, when the ordering of options is altered (for example, by systematically moving the correct answer to different positions), the model\u2019s performance can fluctuate significantly. This phenomenon undermines the reliability of large language models in multiple-choice settings.Political bias\nPolitical bias refers to the tendency of algorithms to systematically favor certain political viewpoints, ideologies, or outcomes over others. Language models may also exhibit political biases. Since the training data includes a wide range of political opinions and coverage, the models might generate responses that lean towards particular political ideologies or viewpoints, depending on the prevalence of those views in the data.Energy demands\nThe energy demands of LLMs have grown along with their size and capabilities. Data centers that enable LLM training require substantial amounts of electricity. Much of that electricity is generated by non-renewable resources that create greenhouse gases and contribute to climate change. Nuclear power and geothermal energy are two options tech companies are exploring to meet the sizable energy demands of LLM training. The significant expense of investing in geothermal solutions has led to major shale producers like Chevron and Exxon Mobil advocating for tech companies to use electricity produced via natural gas to fuel their large energy demands.See also\nFoundation models\nList of large language models\nList of chatbots\nLanguage model benchmark\nSmall language modelReferences\nFurther reading\nJurafsky, Dan, Martin, James.

(2024). \"Foundational Challenges in Assuring Alignment and Safety of Large Language Models\". arXiv:2404.09932.", "result": "# Large language model\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) are machine learning models that have been trained on massive amounts of data to understand and generate human language. They are called \"large\" because they consist of millions or even billions of parameters, which are the numbers that the model learns to associate with each word in its vocabulary. These models are trained using a self-supervised learning process, meaning they learn to predict the next word in a sentence from the previous ones, using large volumes of text data.\n\nThe most advanced LLMs are generative pretrained transformers (GPTs), which can be fine-tuned for a wide range of natural language processing tasks. LLMs can be prompted with a query and respond in a human-like manner. In this sense, they are a type of artificial intelligence (AI) agent.\n\nLLMs are trained on large amounts of text data, such as books, websites, and other digital media, to learn patterns and relationships between words and phrases. This enables them to generate coherent and contextually relevant text, as well as answer questions, translate languages, and perform other natural language tasks. The size of the model refers to the number of parameters it contains, with larger models generally having better performance but requiring more computational resources for training and inference.\n\nLLMs are a subset of deep learning models, which are a class of machine learning algorithms that are inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. They are called \"deep\" because they consist of many layers of interconnected nodes, or neurons, that process information in a hierarchical manner. LLMs are a specific type of deep learning model that are designed to learn and understand natural language.\n\nLLMs can be used in a variety of applications, including chatbots, virtual assistants, content generation, sentiment analysis, and language translation. They are also used as the foundation for more advanced AI systems, such as autonomous vehicles, robotics, and healthcare applications. LLMs are constantly evolving and improving, and are becoming increasingly important in a wide range of industries and fields.\n\nHistory\n\n--- Early language models\n\nPrior to 2017, language models were often based on statistical models, such as the 2001 smoothed n-gram model, which had achieved state-of-the-art perplexity. With the rise of the internet in the 2000s, language models began to rely more heavily on the \"web as corpus\". By 2009, statistical language models had largely supplanted symbolic models.\n\nFollowing the success of neural networks in image processing, Google started applying neural networks to language modeling in 2012. In 2016, Google replaced its Neural Machine Translation system with seq2seq deep LSTM networks.\n\nThe introduction of the transformer architecture at the 2017 NeurIPS conference paper \"Attention Is All You Need\" was the first major advancement in neural networks for language modeling since the introduction of recurrent neural networks in 1997. The attention mechanism, originally introduced by Bahdanau et al. in 2014, was key to the success of the transformer architecture.\n\nThe first transformer-based language model was the open-source OpenAI GPT, which was released in 2018. GPT-2, released in 2019, contained 1.5 billion parameters and was able to produce human-like text. The next major advance was the release of GPT-3 in 2020, which contained 175 billion parameters and demonstrated remarkable proficiency in a wide range of natural language tasks.\n\n--- Large language models\n\nThe term \"large language model\" became popularized in 2022, as the field saw the release of increasingly large models. The first widely publicized large language model was the 175 billion parameter GPT-3, released by OpenAI in May 2020.

The embedding is used in text analysis. Typically, the representation is a real-valued vector that encodes the meaning of the word in such a way that the words that are closer in the vector space are expected to be similar in meaning. Word embeddings can be obtained using language modeling and feature learning techniques, where words or phrases from the vocabulary are mapped to vectors of real numbers.\nMethods to generate this mapping include neural networks, dimensionality reduction on the word co-occurrence matrix, probabilistic models, explainable knowledge base method, and explicit representation in terms of the context in which words appear.\nWord and phrase embeddings, when used as the underlying input representation, have been shown to boost the performance in NLP tasks such as syntactic parsing and sentiment analysis.Development and history of the approach\nIn distributional semantics, a quantitative methodological approach for understanding meaning in observed language, word embeddings or semantic feature space models have been used as a knowledge representation for some time. Such models aim to quantify and categorize semantic similarities between linguistic items based on their distributional properties in large samples of language data.  The underlying idea that \"a word is characterized by the company it keeps\" was proposed in a 1957 article by John Rupert Firth, but also has roots in the contemporaneous work on search systems and in cognitive psychology.\nThe notion of a semantic space with lexical items (words or multi-word terms) represented as vectors or embeddings is based on the computational challenges of capturing distributional characteristics and using them for practical application to measure similarity between words, phrases, or entire documents. The first generation of semantic space models is the vector space model for information retrieval. Such vector space models for words and their distributional data implemented in their simplest form results in a very sparse vector space of high dimensionality (cf. curse of dimensionality). Reducing the number of dimensions using linear algebraic methods such as singular value decomposition then led to the introduction of latent semantic analysis in the late 1980s and the random indexing approach for collecting word co-occurrence contexts. In 2000, Bengio et al. provided in a series of papers titled \"Neural probabilistic language models\" to reduce the high dimensionality of word representations in contexts by \"learning a distributed representation for words\".\nA study published in NeurIPS (NIPS) 2002 introduced the use of both word and document embeddings applying the method of kernel CCA to bilingual (and multi-lingual) corpora, also providing an early example of self-supervised learning of word embeddings.\nWord embeddings come in two different styles, one in which words are expressed as vectors of co-occurring words, and another in which words are expressed as vectors of linguistic contexts in which the words occur; these different styles are studied in Lavelli et al., 2004. Roweis and Saul published in Science how to use \"locally linear embedding\" (LLE) to discover representations of high dimensional data structures. Most new word embedding techniques after about 2005 rely on a neural network architecture instead of more probabilistic and algebraic models, after foundational work done by Yoshua Bengio and colleagues.\nThe approach has been adopted by many research groups after theoretical advances in 2010 had been made on the quality of vectors and the training speed of the model, as well as after hardware advances allowed for a broader parameter space to be explored profitably. In 2013, a team at Google led by Tomas Mikolov created word2vec, a word embedding toolkit that can train vector space models faster than previous approaches. The word2vec approach has been widely used in experimentation and was instrumental in raising interest for word embeddings as a technology, moving the research strand out of specialised research into broader experimentation and eventually paving the way for practical application.Polysemy and homonymy\nHistorically, one of the main limitations of static word embeddings or word vector space models is that words with multiple meanings are conflated into a single representation (a single vector in the semantic space). In other words, polysemy and homonymy are not handled properly. For example, in the sentence \"The club I tried yesterday was great!\", it is not clear if the term club is related to the word sense of a club sandwich, clubhouse, golf club, or any other sense that club might have. The necessity to accommodate multiple meanings per word in different vectors (multi-sense embeddings) is the motivation for several contributions in NLP to split single-sense embeddings into multi-sense ones.\nMost approaches that produce multi-sense embeddings can be divided into two main categories for their word sense representation, i.e., unsupervised and knowledge-based. Based on word2vec skip-gram, Multi-Sense Skip-Gram (MSSG) performs word-sense discrimination and embedding simultaneously, improving its training time, while assuming a specific number of senses for each word. In the Non-Parametric Multi-Sense Skip-Gram (NP-MSSG) this number can vary depending on each word. Combining the prior knowledge of lexical databases (e.g., WordNet, ConceptNet, BabelNet), word embeddings and word sense disambiguation, Most Suitable Sense Annotation (MSSA) labels word-senses through an unsupervised and knowledge-based approach, considering a word's context in a pre-defined sliding window. Once the words are disambiguated, they can be used in a standard word embeddings technique, so multi-sense embeddings are produced. MSSA architecture allows the disambiguation and annotation process to be performed recurrently in a self-improving manner.\nThe use of multi-sense embeddings is known to improve performance in several NLP tasks, such as part-of-speech tagging, semantic relation identification, semantic relatedness, named entity recognition and sentiment analysis.\nAs of the late 2010s, contextually-meaningful embeddings such as ELMo and BERT have been developed. Unlike static word embeddings, these embeddings are at the token-level, in that each occurrence of a word has its own embedding. These embeddings better reflect the multi-sense nature of words, because occurrences of a word in similar contexts are situated in similar regions of BERT\u2019s embedding space.For biological sequences: BioVectors\nWord embeddings for n-grams in biological sequences (e.g. DNA, RNA, and Proteins) for bioinformatics applications have been proposed by Asgari and Mofrad. Named bio-vectors (BioVec) to refer to biological sequences in general with protein-vectors (ProtVec) for proteins (amino-acid sequences) and gene-vectors (GeneVec) for gene sequences, this representation can be widely used in applications of deep learning in proteomics and genomics. The results presented by Asgari and Mofrad suggest that BioVectors can characterize biological sequences in terms of biochemical and biophysical interpretations of the underlying patterns.Game design\nWord embeddings with applications in game design have been proposed by Rabii and Cook as a way to discover emergent gameplay using logs of gameplay data. The process requires transcribing actions that occur during a game within a formal language and then using the resulting text to create word embeddings. The results presented by Rabii and Cook suggest that the resulting vectors can capture expert knowledge about games like chess that are not explicitly stated in the game's rules.Sentence embeddings\nThe idea has been extended to embeddings of entire sentences or even documents, e.g. in the form of the thought vectors concept. In 2015, some researchers suggested \"skip-thought vectors\" as a means to improve the quality of machine translation. A more recent and popular approach for representing sentences is Sentence-BERT, or SentenceTransformers, which modifies pre-trained BERT with the use of siamese and triplet network structures.Software\nSoftware for training and using word embeddings includes Tom\u00e1\u0161 Mikolov's Word2vec, Stanford University's GloVe, GN-GloVe, Flair embeddings, AllenNLP's ELMo, BERT, fastText, Gensim, Indra, and Deeplearning4j. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and T-Distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding (t-SNE) are both used to reduce the dimensionality of word vector spaces and visualize word embeddings and clusters.Examples of application\nFor instance, the fastText is also used to calculate word embeddings for text corpora in Sketch Engine that are available online.Ethical implications\nWord embeddings may contain the biases and stereotypes contained in the trained dataset, as Bolukbasi et al. points out in the 2016 paper \u201cMan is to Computer Programmer as Woman is to Homemaker? Debiasing Word Embeddings\u201d that a publicly available (and popular) word2vec embedding trained on Google News texts (a commonly used data corpus), which consists of text written by professional journalists, still shows disproportionate word associations reflecting gender and racial biases when extracting word analogies. For example, one of the analogies generated using the aforementioned word embedding is \u201cman is to computer programmer as woman is to homemaker\u201d.\nResearch done by Jieyu Zhou et al. shows that the applications of these trained word embeddings without careful oversight likely perpetuates existing bias in society, which is introduced through unaltered training data. Furthermore, word embeddings can even amplify these biases .See also\nEmbedding (machine learning)\nBrown clustering\nDistributional\u2013relational database\n\n\n== References ==", "result": "# Word embedding\n\nA word embedding is a representation of a word or phrase in a vector space, where the position of each word in the vector space reflects its relationship with all other words in the vector space. Words that have similar meanings are located near one another in the space, while words with dissimilar meanings are located far apart.\n\nWord embeddings are generated using various methods, including neural networks, dimensionality reduction, probabilistic models, explainable knowledge base methods, and explicit context representation. They are used in many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as sentiment analysis, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, information retrieval, question answering, and machine translation.\n\nWord embeddings can be generated from a corpus of text, such as a collection of books, news articles, or social media posts. Once generated, word embeddings can be used to represent words in a vector space, allowing them to be compared and analyzed based on their semantic relationships.\n\nDevelopment and history of the approach\n\nThe idea that a word is characterized by the company it keeps has been around since at least 1954, when it was put forward by Zellig Harris. Distributional semantics refers to the approach of using the co-occurrence statistics of words to capture the semantic relationships between words. A simple example of this is the vector space model, which uses term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) to score the importance of terms in a document, and then uses cosine similarity to measure the similarity between documents. Other methods of dimensionality reduction have also been used to reduce the curse of dimensionality, such as singular value decomposition, latent semantic analysis, and random indexing.\n\nIn 2000, Bengio et al. published a paper on learning distributed representations of words through the use of neural probabilistic language models. They showed that a feedforward neural network with a softmax output layer could be trained to predict the next word in a sentence, and that the hidden layer of the network would learn to represent words in a low-dimensional space that captured their semantic relationships. In 2003, Leacock and Chodorow published a study on the use of distributional similarity to identify synonyms in text. They showed that a simple cosine similarity measure between word embeddings could be used to identify synonyms with high accuracy. In 2004, Landauer and Dumais published a paper on the use of latent semantic analysis to model human memory. They showed that the same mathematical model could be used to both model human memory and to perform word sense disambiguation. In 2006, Yarowsky published a paper on the use of supervised learning to train a system to automatically disambiguate word senses. He showed that a system trained on a small set of labeled examples could achieve high accuracy on a large corpus of unlabeled text.\n\nPolysemy and homonymy\n\nStatic word embeddings conflate different senses of a word into a single vector, which can lead to incorrect predictions in downstream tasks. To address this, multi-sense embeddings have been developed, which split single-sense embeddings into multiple embeddings for each sense of a word. There are two main approaches to creating multi-sense embeddings: unsupervised methods, which try to find the best partitioning of the data without using labels, and knowledge-based methods, which try to use external knowledge bases to determine the number of senses a word has and which sentences belong to which sense.\n\nSpecific models include MSSG and NP-MSSG, which use word-sense discrimination and word embedding to create multi-sense embeddings.\n\nFor biological sequences: BioVectors\n\nBioVectors are a type of word embedding used in bioinformatics applications for DNA, RNA, and protein sequences. They can be used to represent n-grams in biological sequences, and can be integrated into deep learning models for use in tasks such as protein sequence classification.\n\nGame design\n\nWord embeddings have been proposed as a way to discover emergent gameplay in games. The process involves transcribing game actions into a formal language, selecting a suitable formal language, transforming the transcribed gameplay data into text suitable for generating word embeddings, and analyzing the resulting word embeddings to uncover emergent gameplay elements. This approach has been used to uncover emergent gameplay elements in games like chess.\n\nSentence embeddings\n\nSentence embeddings are an extension of word embeddings, where the goal is to represent entire sentences in a vector space. The first sentence embeddings were introduced in 2015, called \"skip-thought vectors\", by Kiros et al.. The skip-thought vectors were designed to improve machine translation, but they did not perform better than previous methods. Sentence-BERT or SentenceTransformers is a more recent approach that modifies the pre-trained BERT model to output sentence embeddings by using a siamese and triplet network structure. The siamese network takes in two sentences and outputs a vector that represents the similarity between the two sentences, while the triplet network takes in three sentences and outputs a vector that represents the relative similarity between the three sentences. Sentence-BERT improves upon previous methods by taking into account the order of words in a sentence and by using a contrastive loss function that encourages similar sentences to have similar embeddings and dissimilar sentences to have dissimilar embeddings.\n\nSoftware\n\n* Word2vec\n* GloVe\n* FastText\n* OpenAI's GPT-2\n* Sentence-BERT or SentenceTransformers\n\nExamples of application\n\nWord embeddings are used in search engines, sentiment analysis, machine translation, information retrieval, and text classification.\n\nEthical implications\n\nWord embeddings can be biased and stereotype-prone due to biases and stereotypes present in training datasets. Popular word embeddings like Word2Vec and GloVe exhibit gender and racial biases, as shown by Bolukbasi et al. in 2016. They identified the analogy \u201cman is to computer programmer as woman is to homemaker\u201d in the word embeddings. Jieyu Zhou et al. have shown that the bias is perpetuated if the training data remains unaltered, as the bias in the training data leads to biased word embeddings.

Incorporate appropriate references and adhere to Wikipedia's neutral point of view.", "input": "", "output": "Introduction\nBidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) is a language model introduced in October 2018 by researchers at Google. It learns to represent text as a sequence of vectors using self-supervised learning. It uses the encoder-only transformer architecture. BERT dramatically improved the state-of-the-art for large language models. As of 2020, BERT is a ubiquitous baseline in natural language processing (NLP) experiments. \nBERT is trained by masked token prediction and next sentence prediction. As a result of this training process, BERT learns contextual, latent representations of tokens in their context, similar to ELMo and GPT-2. It found applications for many natural language processing tasks, such as coreference resolution and polysemy resolution. It is an evolutionary step over ELMo, and spawned the study of \"BERTology\", which attempts to interpret what is learned by BERT.\nBERT was originally implemented in the English language at two model sizes, BERTBASE (110 million parameters) and BERTLARGE (340 million parameters). Both were trained on the Toronto BookCorpus (800M words) and English Wikipedia  (2,500M words). The weights were released on GitHub. On March 11, 2020, 24 smaller models were released, the smallest being BERTTINY with just 4 million parameters.Architecture\nBERT is an \"encoder-only\" transformer architecture. At a high level, BERT consists of 4 modules: \n\nTokenizer: This module converts a piece of English text into a sequence of integers (\"tokens\").\nEmbedding: This module converts the sequence of tokens into an array of real-valued vectors representing the tokens. It represents the conversion of discrete token types into a lower-dimensional Euclidean space.\nEncoder: a stack of Transformer blocks with self-attention, but without causal masking.\nTask head: This module converts the final representation vectors into one-hot encoded tokens again by producing a predicted probability distribution over the token types. It can be viewed as a simple decoder, decoding the latent representation into token types, or as an \"un-embedding layer\".\nThe task head is necessary for pre-training, but it is often unnecessary for so-called \"downstream tasks,\" such as question answering or sentiment classification. Instead, one removes the task head and replaces it with a newly initialized module suited for the task, and finetune the new module. The latent vector representation of the model is directly fed into this new module, allowing for sample-efficient transfer learning.Embedding\nThis section describes the embedding used by BERTBASE. The other one, BERTLARGE, is similar, just larger.\nThe tokenizer of BERT is WordPiece, which is a sub-word strategy like byte pair encoding. Its vocabulary size is 30,000, and any token not appearing in its vocabulary is replaced by [UNK] (\"unknown\"). \n\nThe first layer is the embedding layer, which contains three components: token type embeddings, position embeddings, and segment type embeddings. \n\nToken type: The token type is a standard embedding layer, translating a one-hot vector into a dense vector based on its token type.\nPosition: The position embeddings are based on a token's position in the sequence. BERT uses absolute position embeddings, where each position in sequence is mapped to a real-valued vector. Each dimension of the vector consists of a sinusoidal function that takes the position in the sequence as input.\nSegment type: Using a vocabulary of just 0 or 1, this embedding layer produces a dense vector based on whether the token belongs to the first or second text segment in that input. In other words, type-1 tokens are all tokens that appear after the [SEP] special token. All prior tokens are type-0.\nThe three embedding vectors are added together representing the initial token representation as a function of these three pieces of information. After embedding, the vector representation is normalized using a LayerNorm operation, outputting a 768-dimensional vector for each input token. After this, the representation vectors are passed forward through 12 Transformer encoder blocks, and are decoded back to 30,000-dimensional vocabulary space using a basic affine transformation layer.Architectural family\nThe encoder stack of BERT has 2 free parameters: \n  \n    \n      \n        L\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle L}\n  \n, the number of layers, and \n  \n    \n      \n        H\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle H}\n  \n, the hidden size. There are always \n  \n    \n      \n        H\n        \n          /\n        \n        64\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle H/64}\n  \n self-attention heads, and the feed-forward/filter size is always \n  \n    \n      \n        4\n        H\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 4H}\n  \n. By varying these two numbers, one obtains an entire family of BERT models.\nFor BERT\n\nthe feed-forward size and filter size are synonymous. Both of them denote the number of dimensions in the middle layer of the feed-forward network.\nthe hidden size and embedding size are synonymous. Both of them denote the number of real numbers used to represent a token.\nThe notation for encoder stack is written as L/H. For example, BERTBASE is written as 12L/768H, BERTLARGE as 24L/1024H, and BERTTINY as 2L/128H.Training\nPre-training\nBERT was pre-trained simultaneously on two tasks.\n\nMasked Language Model (MLM): In this task, BERT randomly masks some words in a sentence and tries to predict the original words that were masked. For example, in the sentence \"The cat sat on the [MASK],\" BERT would need to predict \"mat.\" This helps BERT learn bidirectional context, meaning it understands the relationships between words not just from left to right or right to left but from both directions at the same time.\nNext Sentence Prediction (NSP): In this task, BERT is trained to predict whether one sentence logically follows another. For example, given two sentences, \"The cat sat on the mat.\" and \"It was a sunny day,\" BERT has to decide if the second sentence is a valid continuation of the first one. This helps BERT understand relationships between sentences, which is important for tasks like question answering or document classification.Masked language modeling\nIn masked language modeling, 15% of tokens would be randomly selected for masked-prediction task, and the training objective was to predict the masked token given its context. In more detail, the selected token is \n\nreplaced with a [MASK] token with probability 80%,\nreplaced with a random word token with probability 10%,\nnot replaced with probability 10%.\nThe reason not all selected tokens are masked is to avoid the dataset shift problem. The dataset shift problem arises when the distribution of inputs seen during training differs significantly from the distribution encountered during inference. A trained BERT model might be applied to word representation (like Word2Vec), where it would be run over sentences not containing any [MASK] tokens. It is later found that more diverse training objectives are generally better.\nAs an illustrative example, consider the sentence \"my dog is cute\". It would first be divided into tokens like \"my1 dog2 is3 cute4\". Then a random token in the sentence would be picked. Let it be the 4th one \"cute4\". Next, there would be three possibilities:\n\nwith probability 80%, the chosen token is masked, resulting in \"my1 dog2 is3 [MASK]4\";\nwith probability 10%, the chosen token is replaced by a uniformly sampled random token, such as \"happy\", resulting in \"my1 dog2 is3 happy4\";\nwith probability 10%, nothing is done, resulting in \"my1 dog2 is3 cute4\".\nAfter processing the input text, the model's 4th output vector is passed to its decoder layer, which outputs a probability distribution over its 30,000-dimensional vocabulary space.Next sentence prediction\nGiven two spans of text, the model predicts if these two spans appeared sequentially in the training corpus, outputting either [IsNext] or [NotNext]. The first span starts with a special token [CLS] (for \"classify\"). The two spans are separated by a special token [SEP] (for \"separate\"). After processing the two spans, the 1-st output vector (the vector coding for [CLS]) is passed to a separate neural network for the binary classification into [IsNext] and [NotNext].\n\nFor example, given \"[CLS] my dog is cute [SEP] he likes playing\" the model should output token [IsNext].\nGiven \"[CLS] my dog is cute [SEP] how do magnets work\" the model should output token [NotNext].Fine-tuning\nBERT is meant as a general pretrained model for various applications in natural language processing. That is, after pre-training, BERT can be fine-tuned with fewer resources on smaller datasets to optimize its performance on specific tasks such as natural language inference and text classification, and sequence-to-sequence-based language generation tasks such as question answering and conversational response generation.\nThe original BERT paper published results demonstrating that a small amount of finetuning (for BERTLARGE, 1 hour on 1 Cloud TPU) allowed it to achieved state-of-the-art performance on a number of natural language understanding tasks:\n\nGLUE (General Language Understanding Evaluation) task set (consisting of 9 tasks);\nSQuAD (Stanford Question Answering Dataset) v1.1 and v2.0;\nSWAG (Situations With Adversarial Generations).\nIn the original paper, all parameters of BERT are finetuned, and recommended that, for downstream applications that are text classifications, the output token at the [CLS] input token is fed into a linear-softmax layer to produce the label outputs.\nThe original code base defined the final linear layer as a \"pooler layer\", in analogy with global pooling in computer vision, even though it simply discards all output tokens except the one corresponding to  [CLS] .Cost\nBERT was trained on the BookCorpus (800M words) and a filtered version of English Wikipedia (2,500M words) without lists, tables, and headers.\nTraining BERTBASE  on 4 cloud TPU (16 TPU chips total) took 4 days, at an estimated cost of 500 USD. Training BERTLARGE on 16 cloud TPU (64 TPU chips total) took 4 days.Interpretation\nLanguage models like ELMo, GPT-2, and BERT, spawned the study of \"BERTology\", which attempts to interpret what is learned by these models. Their performance on these natural language understanding tasks are not yet well understood. Several research publications in 2018 and 2019 focused on investigating the relationship behind BERT's output as a result of carefully chosen input sequences, analysis of internal vector representations through probing classifiers, and the relationships represented by attention weights.\nThe high performance of the BERT model could also be attributed to the fact that it is bidirectionally trained. This means that BERT, based on the Transformer model architecture, applies its self-attention mechanism to learn information from a text from the left and right side during training, and consequently gains a deep understanding of the context. For example, the word fine can have two different meanings depending on the context (I feel fine today, She has fine blond hair). BERT considers the words surrounding the target word fine from the left and right side.\nHowever it comes at a cost: due to encoder-only architecture lacking a decoder, BERT can't be prompted and can't generate text, while bidirectional models in general do not work effectively without the right side, thus being difficult to prompt. As an illustrative example, if one wishes to use BERT to continue a sentence fragment \"Today, I went to\", then naively one would mask out all the tokens as \"Today, I went to  [MASK]  [MASK]  [MASK] ...  [MASK] .\" where the number of  [MASK]  is the length of the sentence one wishes to extend to. However, this constitutes a dataset shift, as during training, BERT has never seen sentences with that many tokens masked out. Consequently, its performance degrades. More sophisticated techniques allow text generation, but at a high computational cost.History\nBERT was originally published by Google researchers Jacob Devlin, Ming-Wei Chang, Kenton Lee, and Kristina Toutanova. The design has its origins from pre-training contextual representations, including semi-supervised sequence learning, generative pre-training, ELMo, and ULMFit. Unlike previous models, BERT is a deeply bidirectional, unsupervised language representation, pre-trained using only a plain text corpus. Context-free models such as word2vec or GloVe generate a single word embedding representation for each word in the vocabulary, whereas BERT takes into account the context for each occurrence of a given word. For instance, whereas the vector for \"running\" will have the same word2vec vector representation for both of its occurrences in the sentences \"He is running a company\" and \"He is running a marathon\", BERT will provide a contextualized embedding that will be different according to the sentence.\nOn October 25, 2019, Google announced that they had started applying BERT models for English language search queries within the US. On December 9, 2019, it was reported that BERT had been adopted by Google Search for over 70 languages. In October 2020, almost every single English-based query was processed by a BERT model.Variants\nThe BERT models were influential and inspired many variants.\nRoBERTa (2019) was an engineering improvement. It preserves BERT's architecture (slightly larger, at 355M parameters), but improves its training, changing key hyperparameters, removing the next-sentence prediction task, and using much larger mini-batch sizes. \nDistilBERT (2019) distills BERTBASE to a model with just 60% of its parameters (66M), while preserving 95% of its benchmark scores. Similarly, TinyBERT (2019) is a distilled model with just 28% of its parameters.\nALBERT (2019) used shared-parameter across layers, and experimented with independently varying the hidden size and the word-embedding layer's output size as two hyperparameters. They also replaced the next sentence prediction task with the sentence-order prediction (SOP) task, where the model must distinguish the correct order of two consecutive text segments from their reversed order. \nELECTRA (2020) applied the idea of generative adversarial networks to the MLM task. Instead of masking out tokens, a small language model generates random plausible substitutions, and a larger network identify these replaced tokens. The small model aims to fool the large model.\nDeBERTa (2020) is a significant architectural variant, with disentangled attention. Its key idea is to treat the positional and token encodings separately throughout the attention mechanism. Instead of combining the positional encoding (\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          x\n          \n            p\n            o\n            s\n            i\n            t\n            i\n            o\n            n\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x_{position}}\n  \n) and token encoding (\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          x\n          \n            token\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x_{\\text{token}}}\n  \n) into a single input vector (\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          x\n          \n            i\n            n\n            p\n            u\n            t\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          x\n          \n            p\n            o\n            s\n            i\n            t\n            i\n            o\n            n\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          x\n          \n            t\n            o\n            k\n            e\n            n\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x_{input}=x_{position}+x_{token}}\n  \n), DeBERTa keeps them separate as a tuple: (\n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        \n          x\n          \n            p\n            o\n            s\n            i\n            t\n            i\n            o\n            n\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          x\n          \n            t\n            o\n            k\n            e\n            n\n          \n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (x_{position},x_{token})}\n  \n).

Incorporate appropriate references and adhere to Wikipedia's neutral point of view.", "input": "", "output": "Introduction\nThe transformer is a deep learning architecture that was developed by researchers at Google and is based on the multi-head attention mechanism, which was proposed in the 2017 paper \"Attention Is All You Need\". Text is converted to numerical representations called tokens, and each token is converted into a vector via lookup from a word embedding table. At each layer, each token is then contextualized within the scope of the context window with other (unmasked) tokens via a parallel multi-head attention mechanism, allowing the signal for key tokens to be amplified and less important tokens to be diminished.\nTransformers have the advantage of having no recurrent units, therefore requiring less training time than earlier recurrent neural architectures (RNNs) such as long short-term memory (LSTM). Later variations have been widely adopted for training large language models (LLM) on large (language) datasets.\n\nTransformers were first developed as an improvement over previous architectures for machine translation, but have found many applications since. They are used in large-scale natural language processing, computer vision (vision transformers), reinforcement learning, audio, multimodal learning, robotics, and even playing chess. It has also led to the development of pre-trained systems, such as generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs) and BERT (bidirectional encoder representations from transformers).History\nPredecessors\nFor many years, sequence modelling and generation was done by using plain recurrent neural networks (RNNs). A well-cited early example was the Elman network (1990). In theory, the information from one token can propagate arbitrarily far down the sequence, but in practice the vanishing-gradient problem leaves the model's state at the end of a long sentence without precise, extractable information about preceding tokens.\nA key breakthrough was LSTM (1995), a RNN which used various innovations to overcome the vanishing gradient problem, allowing efficient learning of long-sequence modelling. One key innovation was the use of an attention mechanism which used neurons that multiply the outputs of other neurons, so-called multiplicative units. Neural networks using multiplicative units were later called sigma-pi networks or higher-order networks. LSTM became the standard architecture for long sequence modelling until the 2017 publication of Transformers.\nHowever, LSTM still used sequential processing, like most other RNNs. Specifically, RNNs operate one token at a time from first to last; they cannot operate in parallel over all tokens in a sequence. \nModern Transformers overcome this problem, but unlike RNNs, they require computation time that is quadratic in the size of the context window. The linearly scaling fast weight controller (1992) learns to compute a weight matrix for further processing depending on the input. One of its two networks has \"fast weights\" or \"dynamic links\" (1981). A slow neural network learns by gradient descent to generate keys and values for computing the weight changes of the fast neural network which computes answers to queries. This was later shown to be equivalent to the unnormalized linear Transformer.Attention with seq2seq\nThe idea of encoder-decoder sequence transduction had been developed in the early 2010s (see previous papers). The papers most commonly cited as the originators that produced seq2seq are two concurrently published papers from 2014.\nA 380M-parameter model for machine translation uses two long short-term memories (LSTM). Its architecture consists of two parts. The encoder is an LSTM that takes in a sequence of tokens and turns it into a vector. The decoder is another LSTM that converts the vector into a sequence of tokens. Similarly, another 130M-parameter model used gated recurrent units (GRU) instead of LSTM. Later research showed that GRUs are neither better nor worse than LSTMs for seq2seq.\nThese early seq2seq models had no attention mechanism, and the state vector is accessible only after the last word of the source text was processed. Although in theory such a vector retains the information about the whole original sentence, in practice the information is poorly preserved. This is because the input is processed sequentially by one recurrent network into a fixed-size output vector, which is then processed by another recurrent network into an output. If the input is long, then the output vector would not be able to contain all relevant information, degrading the output. As evidence, reversing the input sentence improved seq2seq translation.\nThe RNNsearch model introduced an attention mechanism to seq2seq for machine translation to solve the bottleneck problem (of the fixed-size output vector), allowing the model to process long-distance dependencies more easily. The name is because it \"emulates searching through a source sentence during decoding a translation\".\nThe relative performances were compared between global (that of RNNsearch) and local (sliding window) attention model architectures for machine translation, finding that mixed attention had higher quality than global attention, while local attention reduced translation time.\nIn 2016, Google Translate was revamped to Google Neural Machine Translation, which replaced the previous model based on statistical machine translation. The new model was a seq2seq model where the encoder and the decoder were both 8 layers of bidirectional LSTM. It took nine months to develop, and it outperformed the statistical approach, which took ten years to develop.Parallelizing attention\nSeq2seq models with attention (including self-attention) still suffered from the same issue with recurrent networks, which is that they are hard to parallelize, which prevented them from being accelerated on GPUs. In 2016, decomposable attention applied a self-attention mechanism to feedforward networks, which are easy to parallelize, and achieved SOTA result in textual entailment with an order of magnitude fewer parameters than LSTMs. One of its authors, Jakob Uszkoreit, suspected that attention without recurrence is sufficient for language translation, thus the title \"attention is all you need\". That hypothesis was against conventional wisdom at the time, and even his father Hans Uszkoreit, a well-known computational linguist, was skeptical. In the same year, self-attention (called intra-attention or intra-sentence attention) was proposed for LSTMs.\nIn 2017, the original (100M-sized) encoder-decoder transformer model was proposed in the \"Attention is all you need\" paper. At the time, the focus of the research was on improving seq2seq for machine translation, by removing its recurrence to process all tokens in parallel, but preserving its dot-product attention mechanism to keep its text processing performance. This led to the introduction of a multi-head attention model that was easier to parallelize due to the use of independent heads and the lack of recurrence. Its parallelizability was an important factor to its widespread use in large neural networks.AI boom era\nAlready in spring 2017, even before the \"Attention is all you need\" preprint was published, one of the co-authors applied the \"decoder-only\" variation of the architecture to generate fictitious Wikipedia articles. Transformer architecture is now used alongside many generative models that contribute to the ongoing AI boom.\nIn language modelling, ELMo (2018) was a bi-directional LSTM that produces contextualized word embeddings, improving upon the line of research from bag of words and word2vec. It was followed by BERT (2018), an encoder-only Transformer model. In 2019 October, Google started using BERT to process search queries. In 2020, Google Translate replaced the previous RNN-encoder\u2013RNN-decoder model by a Transformer-encoder\u2013RNN-decoder model.\nStarting in 2018, the OpenAI GPT series of decoder-only Transformers became state of the art in natural language generation. In 2022, a chatbot based on GPT-3, ChatGPT, became unexpectedly popular, triggering a boom around large language models.\nSince 2020, Transformers have been applied in modalities beyond text, including the vision transformer, speech recognition, robotics, and multimodal. The vision transformer, in turn, stimulated new developments in convolutional neural networks. Image and video generators like DALL-E (2021), Stable Diffusion 3 (2024), and Sora (2024), use Transformers to analyse input data (like text prompts) by breaking it down into \"tokens\" and then calculating the relevance between each token using self-attention, which helps the model understand the context and relationships within the data.Training\nMethods for stabilizing training\nThe plain transformer architecture had difficulty converging. In the original paper the authors recommended using learning rate warmup. That is, the learning rate should linearly scale up from 0 to maximal value for the first part of the training (usually recommended to be 2% of the total number of training steps), before decaying again.\nA 2020 paper found that using layer normalization before (instead of after) multiheaded attention and feedforward layers stabilizes training, not requiring learning rate warmup.Pretrain-finetune\nTransformers typically are first pretrained by self-supervised learning on a large generic dataset, followed by supervised fine-tuning on a small task-specific dataset. The pretrain dataset is typically an unlabeled large corpus, such as The Pile. Tasks for pretraining and fine-tuning commonly include:\n\nlanguage modeling\nnext-sentence prediction\nquestion answering\nreading comprehension\nsentiment analysis\nparaphrasing\nThe T5 transformer report documents a large number of natural language pretraining tasks. Some examples are:\n\nrestoring or repairing incomplete or corrupted text. For example, the input, \"Thank you\u202f~~\u202fme to your party\u202f~~\u202fweek\", might generate the output, \"Thank you for inviting me to your party last week\".\ntranslation between natural languages (machine translation)\njudging the pragmatic acceptability of natural language. For example, the following sentence might be judged \"not acceptable\", because even though it is syntactically well-formed, it is improbable in ordinary human usage: The course is jumping well.\nNote that while each of these tasks is trivial or obvious for human native speakers of the language (or languages), they have typically proved challenging for previous generations of machine learning architecture.Tasks\nIn general, there are 3 classes of language modelling tasks: \"masked\", \"autoregressive\", and \"prefixLM\". These classes are independent of a specific modeling architecture such as Transformer, but they are often discussed in the context of Transformer.\nIn a masked task, one or more of the tokens is masked out, and the model would produce a probability distribution predicting what the masked-out tokens are based on the context. The loss function for the task is typically sum of log-perplexities for the masked-out tokens: \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          Loss\n        \n        =\n        \u2212\n        \n          \u2211\n          \n            t\n            \u2208\n            \n              masked tokens\n            \n          \n        \n        ln\n        \u2061\n        (\n        \n          probability of \n        \n        t\n        \n           conditional on its context\n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\text{Loss}}=-\\sum _{t\\in {\\text{masked tokens}}}\\ln({\\text{probability of }}t{\\text{ conditional on its context}})}\n  \nand the model is trained to minimize this loss function. The BERT series of models are trained for masked token prediction and another task.\nIn an autoregressive task, the entire sequence is masked at first, and the model produces a probability distribution for the first token. Then the first token is revealed and the model predicts the second token, and so on. The loss function for the task is still typically the same. The GPT series of models are trained by autoregressive tasks.\nIn a prefixLM task, the sequence is divided into two parts. The first part is presented as context, and the model predicts the first token of the second part. Then that would be revealed, and the model predicts the second token, and so on. The loss function for the task is still typically the same. The T5 series of models are trained by prefixLM tasks.\nNote that \"masked\" as in \"masked language modelling\" is not \"masked\" as in \"masked attention\", and \"prefixLM\" (prefix language modeling) is not \"prefixLM\" (prefix language model).Architecture\nAll transformers have the same primary components:\n\nTokenizers, which convert text into tokens.\nEmbedding layer, which converts tokens and positions of the tokens into vector representations.\nTransformer layers, which carry out repeated transformations on the vector representations, extracting more and more linguistic information. These consist of alternating attention and feedforward layers. There are two major types of transformer layers: encoder layers and decoder layers, with further variants.\nUn-embedding layer, which converts the final vector representations back to a probability distribution over the tokens.\nThe following description follows exactly the Transformer as described in the original paper. There are variants, described in the following section.\nBy convention, we write all vectors as row vectors. This, for example, means that pushing a vector through a linear layer means multiplying it by a weight matrix on the right, as \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n        W\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle xW}\n  \n.Tokenization\nAs the Transformer architecture natively processes numerical data, not text, there must be a translation between text and tokens. A token is an integer that represents a character, or a short segment of characters. On the input side, the input text is parsed into a token sequence. Similarly, on the output side, the output tokens are parsed back to text. The module doing the conversion between texts and token sequences is a tokenizer.\nThe set of all tokens is the vocabulary of the tokenizer, and its size is the vocabulary size \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          n\n          \n            vocabulary\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n_{\\text{vocabulary}}}\n  \n. When faced with tokens outside the vocabulary, typically a special token is used, written as \"[UNK]\" for \"unknown\".\nSome commonly used tokenizers are byte pair encoding, WordPiece, and SentencePiece.Embedding\nEach token is converted into an embedding vector via a lookup table. Equivalently stated, it multiplies a one-hot representation of the token by an embedding matrix \n  \n    \n      \n        M\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle M}\n  \n.

This shall induce a bias towards the order of the input sequence, so that, for example, the input sequence \"man bites dog\" is processed differently from \"dog bites man\".\nThe positional encoding is defined as a function of type \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        :\n        \n          R\n        \n        \u2192\n        \n          \n            R\n          \n          \n            d\n          \n        \n        ;\n        d\n        \u2208\n        \n          Z\n        \n        ,\n        d\n        >\n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f:\\mathbb {R} \\to \\mathbb {R} ^{d};d\\in \\mathbb {Z} ,d>0}\n  \n, where \n  \n    \n      \n        d\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle d}\n  \n is a positive even integer.

This allows the transformer to take any encoded position and find a linear sum of the encoded locations of its neighbors. This sum of encoded positions, when fed into the attention mechanism, would create attention weights on its neighbors, much like what happens in a convolutional neural network language model. In the author's words, \"we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by relative position.\"\nIn typical implementations, all operations are done over the real numbers, not the complex numbers, but since complex multiplication can be implemented as real 2-by-2 matrix multiplication, this is a mere notational difference.Encoder-decoder (overview)\nLike earlier seq2seq models, the original transformer model used an encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder consists of encoding layers that process all the input tokens together one layer after another, while the decoder consists of decoding layers that iteratively process the encoder's output and the decoder's output tokens so far.\nThe purpose of each encoder layer is to create contextualized representations of the tokens, where each representation corresponds to a token that \"mixes\" information from other input tokens via self-attention mechanism. Each decoder layer contains two attention sublayers: (1) cross-attention for incorporating the output of encoder (contextualized input token representations), and (2) self-attention for \"mixing\" information among the input tokens to the decoder (i.e. the tokens generated so far during inference time).\nBoth the encoder and decoder layers have a feed-forward neural network for additional processing of their outputs and contain residual connections and layer normalization steps. These feed-forward layers contain most of the parameters in a Transformer model.Feedforward network\nThe feedforward network (FFN) modules in a Transformer are 2-layered multilayer perceptrons:\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          F\n          F\n          N\n        \n        (\n        x\n        )\n        =\n        \u03d5\n        (\n        x\n        \n          W\n          \n            (\n            1\n            )\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          b\n          \n            (\n            1\n            )\n          \n        \n        )\n        \n          W\n          \n            (\n            2\n            )\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          b\n          \n            (\n            2\n            )\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {FFN} (x)=\\phi (xW^{(1)}+b^{(1)})W^{(2)}+b^{(2)}}\n  \nwhere \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          W\n          \n            (\n            1\n            )\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle W^{(1)}}\n  \n and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          W\n          \n            (\n            2\n            )\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle W^{(2)}}\n  \n are weight matrices and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          b\n          \n            (\n            1\n            )\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle b^{(1)}}\n  \n and  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          b\n          \n            (\n            2\n            )\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle b^{(2)}}\n  \n are bias vectors, and \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03d5\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\phi }\n  \n is its activation function.

It is theoretically possible for all three to be different, but that is rarely the case in practice.Multiheaded attention\nOne set of \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          (\n          \n            \n              W\n              \n                Q\n              \n            \n            ,\n            \n              W\n              \n                K\n              \n            \n            ,\n            \n              W\n              \n                V\n              \n            \n          \n          )\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\left(W^{Q},W^{K},W^{V}\\right)}\n  \n matrices is called an attention head, and each layer in a transformer model has multiple attention heads. While each attention head attends to the tokens that are relevant to each token, multiple attention heads allow the model to do this for different definitions of \"relevance\". Specifically, the query and key projection matrices, \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          W\n          \n            Q\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle W^{Q}}\n  \n and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          W\n          \n            K\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle W^{K}}\n  \n , which are involved in the attention score computation, defines the \"relevance\". Meanwhile, the value projection matrix \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          W\n          \n            V\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle W^{V}}\n  \n, in combination with the part of the output projection matrix \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          W\n          \n            O\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle W^{O}}\n  \n, determines how the attended tokens influence what information is passed to subsequent layers and ultimately the output logits. In addition, the scope of attention, or the range of token relationships captured by each attention head, can expand as tokens pass through successive layers. This allows the model to capture more complex and long-range dependencies in deeper layers. Many transformer attention heads encode relevance relations that are meaningful to humans. For example, some attention heads can attend mostly to the next word, while others mainly attend from verbs to their direct objects. The computations for each attention head can be performed in parallel, which allows for fast processing. The outputs for the attention layer are concatenated to pass into the feed-forward neural network layers.\nConcretely, let the multiple attention heads be indexed by \n  \n    \n      \n        i\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i}\n  \n, then we have\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          MultiheadedAttention\n        \n        (\n        Q\n        ,\n        K\n        ,\n        V\n        )\n        =\n        \n          \n            Concat\n          \n          \n            i\n            \u2208\n            [\n            \n              n\n              \n                heads\n              \n            \n            ]\n          \n        \n        (\n        \n          Attention\n        \n        (\n        Q\n        \n          W\n          \n            i\n          \n          \n            Q\n          \n        \n        ,\n        K\n        \n          W\n          \n            i\n          \n          \n            K\n          \n        \n        ,\n        V\n        \n          W\n          \n            i\n          \n          \n            V\n          \n        \n        )\n        )\n        \n          W\n          \n            O\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\text{MultiheadedAttention}}(Q,K,V)={\\text{Concat}}_{i\\in [n_{\\text{heads}}]}({\\text{Attention}}(QW_{i}^{Q},KW_{i}^{K},VW_{i}^{V}))W^{O}}\n  \n where the matrix \n  \n    \n      \n        X\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle X}\n  \n is the concatenation of word embeddings, and the matrices \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          W\n          \n            i\n          \n          \n            Q\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          W\n          \n            i\n          \n          \n            K\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          W\n          \n            i\n          \n          \n            V\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle W_{i}^{Q},W_{i}^{K},W_{i}^{V}}\n  \n are \"projection matrices\" owned by individual attention head \n  \n    \n      \n        i\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i}\n  \n, and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          W\n          \n            O\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle W^{O}}\n  \n is a final projection matrix owned by the whole multi-headed attention head.\nIt is theoretically possible for each attention head to have a different head dimension \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          d\n          \n            head\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle d_{\\text{head}}}\n  \n, but that is rarely the case in practice.\nAs an example, in the smallest GPT-2 model, there are only self-attention mechanisms.

The first encoder layer takes the sequence of input vectors from the embedding layer, producing a sequence of vectors. This sequence of vectors is processed by the second encoder, and so on. The output from the final encoder layer is then used by the decoder.\nAs the encoder processes the entire input all at once, every token can attend to every other token (all-to-all attention), so there is no need for causal masking.Decoder\nA decoder consists of an embedding layer, followed by multiple decoder layers, followed by an un-embedding layer.\nEach decoder consists of three major components: a causally masked self-attention mechanism, a cross-attention mechanism, and a feed-forward neural network. The decoder functions in a similar fashion to the encoder, but an additional attention mechanism is inserted which instead draws relevant information from the encodings generated by the encoders. This mechanism can also be called the encoder-decoder attention.\nLike the first encoder, the first decoder takes positional information and embeddings of the output sequence as its input, rather than encodings. The transformer must not use the current or future output to predict an output, so the output sequence must be partially masked to prevent this reverse information flow. This allows for autoregressive text generation. For decoding, all-to-all attention is inappropriate, because a token cannot attend to tokens not yet generated. Thus, the self-attention module in the decoder is causally masked.\nIn contrast, the cross-attention mechanism attends to the output vectors of the encoder, which is computed before the decoder starts decoding. Consequently, there is no need for masking in the cross-attention mechanism.\nSchematically, we have:\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                \n                  H\n                  \u2032\n                \n              \n              \n                \n                =\n                \n                  MaskedMultiheadedAttention\n                \n                (\n                H\n                ,\n                H\n                ,\n                H\n                )\n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  DecoderLayer\n                \n                (\n                H\n                )\n              \n              \n                \n                =\n                \n                  FFN\n                \n                (\n                \n                  MultiheadedAttention\n                \n                (\n                \n                  H\n                  \u2032\n                \n                ,\n                \n                  H\n                  \n                    E\n                  \n                \n                ,\n                \n                  H\n                  \n                    E\n                  \n                \n                )\n                )\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\begin{aligned}H'&={\\text{MaskedMultiheadedAttention}}(H,H,H)\\\\{\\text{DecoderLayer}}(H)&={\\text{FFN}}({\\text{MultiheadedAttention}}(H',H^{E},H^{E}))\\end{aligned}}}\n  \nwhere \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          H\n          \n            E\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle H^{E}}\n  \n is the matrix with rows being the output vectors from the encoder.\nThe last decoder is followed by a final un-embedding layer. to produce the output probabilities over the vocabulary. Then, one of the tokens is sampled according to the probability, and the decoder can be run again to produce the next token, etc, autoregressively generating output text.Adapted architectures\nMany large language models, since they do not need to predict a whole new sequence from an input sequence, only use the encoder or decoder of the original transformer architecture. Early GPT models are decoder-only models trained to predict the next token in a sequence. BERT, another language model, only makes use of an encoder, and is trained to predict a randomly masked token in a sequence.Full transformer architecture\nSublayers\nEach encoder layer contains 2 sublayers: the self-attention and the feedforward network. Each decoder layer contains 3 sublayers: the causally masked self-attention, the cross-attention, and the feedforward network.\n\nThe final points of detail are the residual connections and layer normalization (LayerNorm, or LN), which while conceptually unnecessary, are necessary for numerical stability and convergence.  \nThe residual connection, which is introduced to avoid vanishing gradient issues and stabilize the training process, can be expressed as follows: y = F(x) + x. The expression indicates that an output y is the sum of the transformation of input x (F(x)) and the input itself (x). Adding the input x can preserve the input information and avoid issues when the gradient of F(x) is close to zero.  \nSimilarly to how the feedforward network modules are applied individually to each vector, the LayerNorm is also applied individually to each vector. \nThere are two common conventions in use: the post-LN and the pre-LN convention.

The pre-LN convention, proposed several times in 2018, was found to be easier to train, requiring no warm-up, leading to faster convergence.Pseudocode\nThe following is the pseudocode for a standard pre-LN encoder-decoder Transformer, adapted from\n\ninput: Encoder input t_e\n       Decoder input t_d\noutput: Array of probability distributions, with shape (decoder vocabulary size x length(decoder output sequence))\n\n/* encoder */\nz_e \u2190 encoder.tokenizer(t_e)\n\nfor each t in 1:length(z_e) do\n    z_e[t] \u2190 encoder.embedding(z_e[t]) + encoder.positional_embedding(t)\n\nfor each l in 1:length(encoder.layers) do\n    layer \u2190 encoder.layers[l]\n\n    /* first sublayer */\n    z_e_copy \u2190 copy(z_e)\n    for each t in 1:length(z_e) do\n        z_e[t] \u2190 layer.layer_norm(z_e[t])\n    z_e \u2190 layer.multiheaded_attention(z_e, z_e, z_e)\n    for each t in 1:length(z_e) do\n        z_e[t] \u2190 z_e[t] + z_e_copy[t]\n\n    /* second sublayer */\n    z_e_copy \u2190 copy(z_e)\n    for each t in 1:length(z_e) do\n        z_e[t] \u2190 layer.layer_norm(z_e[t])\n    z_e \u2190 layer.feedforward(z_e)\n    for each t in 1:length(z_e) do\n        z_e[t] \u2190 z_e[t] + z_e_copy[t]\n\nfor each t in 1:length(z_e) do\n    z_e[t] \u2190 encoder.final_layer_norm(z_e[t])\n\n/* decoder */\nz_d \u2190 decoder.tokenizer(t_d)\n\nfor each t in 1:length(z_d) do\n    z_d[t] \u2190 decoder.embedding(z_d[t]) + decoder.positional_embedding(t)\n\nfor each l in 1:length(decoder.layers) do\n        layer \u2190 decoder.layers[l]\n\n        /* first sublayer */\n        z_d_copy \u2190 copy(z_d)\n        for each t in 1:length(z_d) do\n            z_d[t] \u2190 layer.layer_norm(z_d[t])\n        z_d \u2190 layer.masked_multiheaded_attention(z_d, z_d, z_d)\n        for each t in 1:length(z_d) do\n            z_d[t] \u2190 z_d[t] + z_d_copy[t]\n\n        /* second sublayer */\n        z_d_copy \u2190 copy(z_d)\n        for each t in 1:length(z_d) do\n            z_d[t] \u2190 layer.layer_norm(z_d[t])\n        z_d \u2190 layer.multiheaded_attention(z_d, z_e, z_e) \n        for each i in 1:length(z_d) do\n            z_d[t] \u2190 z_d[t] + z_d_copy[t]\n\n        /* third sublayer */\n        z_d_copy \u2190 copy(z_d)\n        for each t in 1:length(z_d) do\n            z_d[t] \u2190 layer.layer_norm(z_d[t])\n        z_d \u2190 layer.feedforward(z_d)\n        for each t in 1:length(z_d) do\n            z_d[t] \u2190 z_d[t] + z_d_copy[t]\n\nz_d \u2190 decoder.final_layer_norm(z_d)\n\noutput_distributions \u2190 []\nfor each t in 1:length(z_d) do\n    output_distributions.append(decoder.unembed(z_d[t]))\n\nreturn output_distributionsTerminology\nThe Transformer architecture, being modular, allows variations. Several common variations are described here.\nAn \"encoder-only\" Transformer applies the encoder to map an input text into a sequence of vectors that represent the input text. This is usually used for text embedding and representation learning for downstream applications. BERT is encoder-only. They are less often used currently, as they were found to be not significantly better than training an encoder-decoder Transformer, then taking just the encoder.\nA \"decoder-only\" Transformer is not literally decoder-only, since without an encoder, the cross-attention mechanism has nothing to attend to. Thus, the decoder layers in a decoder-only Transformer is composed of just two sublayers: the causally masked self-attention, and the feedforward network. This is usually used for text generation and instruction following. The models in the GPT series and Chinchilla series are decoder-only.\nAn \"encoder-decoder\" Transformer is generally the same as the original Transformer, with 2 sublayers per encoder layer and 3 sublayers per decoder layer, etc. They might have minor architectural improvements, such as alternative activation functions, changing the location of normalization, etc. This is also usually used for text generation and instruction following. The models in the T5 series are encoder-decoder.\nA \"prefixLM\" (prefix language model) is a decoder-only architecture, but with prefix masking, which is different from causal masking. Specifically, it has mask of the form:\u200aFigure 3\u200a\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          M\n          \n            prefixLM\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            [\n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    0\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \u2212\n                  \u221e\n                \n              \n              \n                \n                  \n                    0\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    M\n                    \n                      causal\n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n            ]\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle M_{\\text{prefixLM}}={\\begin{bmatrix}\\mathbf {0} &-\\infty \\\\\\mathbf {0} &M_{\\text{causal}}\\end{bmatrix}}}\n  \nwhere the first columns correspond to the \"prefix\", and the subsequent columns correspond to the autoregressively generated text based on the prefix. They resemble encoder-decoder models, but has less \"sparsity\". Such models are rarely used, though they are cited as theoretical possibilities and benchmarked comparisons.\nThere are also mixed seq2seq models. For example, in 2020, Google Translate replaced the previous RNN-encoder\u2013RNN-decoder model by a Transformer-encoder\u2013RNN-decoder model, on the argument that an RNN-decoder runs much faster than Transformer-decoder when run autoregressively.Subsequent work\nAlternative activation functions\nThe original transformer uses ReLU activation function. Other activation functions were developed. The Llama series and PaLM used SwiGLU; both GPT-1 and BERT used GELU. \nAlternative activation functions are often used in combination with Gated Linear Units in the feedforward module.Alternative normalizations\nThe normalization used in the Transformer can be different from LayerNorm. One example is RMSNorm which is used in the Llama series. Other examples include CapsuleNorm ScaleNorm, or FixNorm.Alternative positional encodings\nTransformers may use other positional encoding methods than sinusoidal. \nThe original Transformer paper reported using a learned positional encoding, but finding it not superior to the sinusoidal one. Later,  found that causal masking itself provides enough signal to a Transformer decoder that it can learn to implicitly perform absolute positional encoding without the positional encoding module.RoPE\nRoPE (rotary positional embedding), is best explained by considering a list of 2-dimensional vectors \n  \n    \n      \n        [\n        (\n        \n          x\n          \n            1\n          \n          \n            (\n            1\n            )\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          x\n          \n            1\n          \n          \n            (\n            2\n            )\n          \n        \n        )\n        ,\n        (\n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n          \n            (\n            1\n            )\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n          \n            (\n            2\n            )\n          \n        \n        )\n        ,\n        (\n        \n          x\n          \n            3\n          \n          \n            (\n            1\n            )\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          x\n          \n            3\n          \n          \n            (\n            2\n            )\n          \n        \n        )\n        ,\n        .\n        .\n        .\n        ]\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle [(x_{1}^{(1)},x_{1}^{(2)}),(x_{2}^{(1)},x_{2}^{(2)}),(x_{3}^{(1)},x_{3}^{(2)}),...]}\n  \n.

Since it is directly plugged into the attention mechanism, it can be combined with any positional encoder that is plugged into the \"bottom\" of the entire network (which is where the sinusoidal encoder on the original transformer, as well as RoPE and many others, are located).Relative Position Encodings\nRelative Position Encodings is similar to ALiBi, but more generic:\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                \n                  Attention\n                \n                (\n                Q\n                ,\n                K\n                ,\n                V\n                )\n                =\n                \n                  softmax\n                \n                \n                  (\n                  \n                    \n                      \n                        \n                          Q\n                          \n                            K\n                            \n                              \n                                T\n                              \n                            \n                          \n                        \n                        \n                          \n                            d\n                            \n                              k\n                            \n                          \n                        \n                      \n                    \n                    +\n                    B\n                  \n                  )\n                \n                V\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\begin{aligned}{\\text{Attention}}(Q,K,V)={\\text{softmax}}\\left({\\frac {QK^{\\mathrm {T} }}{\\sqrt {d_{k}}}}+B\\right)V\\end{aligned}}}\n  \nwhere \n  \n    \n      \n        B\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle B}\n  \n is a Toeplitz matrix, that is, \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          B\n          \n            i\n            ,\n            j\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          B\n          \n            \n              i\n              \u2032\n            \n            ,\n            \n              j\n              \u2032\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle B_{i,j}=B_{i',j'}}\n  \n whenever \n  \n    \n      \n        i\n        \u2212\n        j\n        =\n        \n          i\n          \u2032\n        \n        \u2212\n        \n          j\n          \u2032\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i-j=i'-j'}\n  \n. This is contrasted with the original sinusoidal positional encoding, which is an \"absolute positional encoding\".Efficient implementation\nThe transformer model has been implemented in standard deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch. Transformers is a library produced by Hugging Face that supplies transformer-based architectures and pretrained models.KV caching\nWhen an autoregressive transformer is used for inference, such as generating text, the query vector is different at each step, but the already-computed key and value vectors are always the same. The KV caching method saves the computed key and value vectors at each attention block, so that they are not recomputed at each new token. PagedAttention applies memory paging to KV caching.\nIf a transformer is used with a baked-in prompt, such as [\"You are a customer support agent...\"], then the key and value vectors can be computed for the prompt, and saved on disk. The saving in compute is significant when the model is used for many short interactions, such as in online chatbots.FlashAttention\nFlashAttention is an algorithm that implements the transformer attention mechanism efficiently on a GPU. It is a communication-avoiding algorithm that performs matrix multiplications in blocks, such that each block fits within the cache of a GPU, and by careful management of the blocks it minimizes data copying between GPU caches (as data movement is slow). See the page on softmax for details.\nAn improved version, FlashAttention-2, was developed to cater to the rising demand for language models capable of handling longer context lengths. It offers enhancements in work partitioning and parallelism, enabling it to achieve up to 230 TFLOPs/s on A100 GPUs (FP16/BF16), a 2x speed increase over the original FlashAttention.\nKey advancements in FlashAttention-2 include the reduction of non-matmul FLOPs, improved parallelism over the sequence length dimension, better work partitioning between GPU warps, and added support for head dimensions up to 256 and multi-query attention (MQA) and grouped-query attention (GQA).\nBenchmarks revealed FlashAttention-2 to be up to 2x faster than FlashAttention and up to 9x faster than a standard attention implementation in PyTorch. Future developments include optimization for new hardware like H100 GPUs and new data types like FP8.Multi-Query Attention\nMulti-Query Attention changes the multiheaded attention mechanism.

MQA is GQA with one group, while standard multiheaded attention is GQA with the maximal number of groups.\n\nMultihead Latent Attention (MLA) is a low-rank approximation to standard MHA. Specifically, each hidden vector, before entering the attention mechanism, is first projected to two low-dimensional spaces (\"latent space\"), one for query and one for key-value (KV vector). This design minimizes the KV cache, as only the low-dimensional KV vector needs to be cached.Speculative decoding\nSpeculative decoding is a method to accelerate token decoding. Similarly to speculative execution in CPUs, future tokens are computed quickly, then verified. If the quickly computed tokens are incorrect, they are discarded and computed slowly.\nThe key factor in speculative decoding is that a Transformer decoder can verify faster than it can decode, in the following sense.\nSuppose we have two transformer models like GPT-3 and GPT-3-small, both with a context window size of 512. To generate an entire context window autoregressively with greedy decoding with GPT-3, it must be run for 512 times, each time generating a token \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          x\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        ,\n        .\n        .\n        .\n        ,\n        \n          x\n          \n            512\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{512}}\n  \n, taking time \n  \n    \n      \n        512\n        \n          T\n          \n            GPT-3\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 512T_{\\text{GPT-3}}}\n  \n. However, if we had some educated guess for the values of these tokens, we could verify all of them in parallel, in one run of the model, by checking that each \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          x\n          \n            t\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x_{t}}\n  \n is indeed the token with the largest log-likelihood in the \n  \n    \n      \n        t\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle t}\n  \n-th output.\nIn speculative decoding, a smaller model or some other simple heuristic is used to generate a few speculative tokens that are subsequently verified by the larger model. For example, suppose we use GPT-3-small to generate four speculative tokens: \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                x\n                ~\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          \n            \n              \n                x\n                ~\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          \n            \n              \n                x\n                ~\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            3\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          \n            \n              \n                x\n                ~\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            4\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\tilde {x}}_{1},{\\tilde {x}}_{2},{\\tilde {x}}_{3},{\\tilde {x}}_{4}}\n  \n.

However, that vector can then be further processed by another Transformer block to predict the next token, and so on for arbitrarily many steps into the future. This trades off accuracy for speed, since each new token costs just one more Transformer block, rather than the entire stack.Sub-quadratic transformers\nTraining transformer-based architectures can be expensive, especially for long inputs. Many methods have been developed to attempt to address the issue. In the image domain, Swin Transformer is an efficient architecture that performs attention inside shifting windows. In the audio domain, SepTr decouples the attention in time and frequency domains. Long Range Arena (2020) is a standard benchmark for comparing the behavior of transformer architectures over long inputs.Alternative attention graphs\nThe standard attention graph is either all-to-all or causal, both of which scales as \n  \n    \n      \n        O\n        (\n        \n          N\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle O(N^{2})}\n  \n where \n  \n    \n      \n        N\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle N}\n  \n is the number of tokens in a sequence.\nReformer (2020) reduces the computational load from \n  \n    \n      \n        O\n        (\n        \n          N\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle O(N^{2})}\n  \n to \n  \n    \n      \n        O\n        (\n        N\n        ln\n        \u2061\n        N\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle O(N\\ln N)}\n  \n by using locality-sensitive hashing and reversible layers. \nSparse attention uses attention graphs that grows slower than \n  \n    \n      \n        O\n        (\n        \n          N\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle O(N^{2})}\n  \n. For example, BigBird (2020) uses random small-world networks which grows as \n  \n    \n      \n        O\n        (\n        N\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle O(N)}\n  \n.\nOrdinary transformers require a memory size that is quadratic in the size of the context window. Attention-free transformers reduce this to a linear dependence while still retaining the advantages of a transformer by linking the key to the value.Random Feature Attention\nRandom Feature Attention (2021) uses Fourier random features:\n  \n    \n      \n        \u03c6\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        =\n        \n          \n            1\n            \n              D\n            \n          \n        \n        [\n        cos\n        \u2061\n        \u27e8\n        \n          w\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        x\n        \u27e9\n        ,\n        sin\n        \u2061\n        \u27e8\n        \n          w\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        x\n        \u27e9\n        ,\n        \u22ef\n        cos\n        \u2061\n        \u27e8\n        \n          w\n          \n            D\n          \n        \n        ,\n        x\n        \u27e9\n        ,\n        sin\n        \u2061\n        \u27e8\n        \n          w\n          \n            D\n          \n        \n        ,\n        x\n        \u27e9\n        \n          ]\n          \n            T\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\varphi (x)={\\frac {1}{\\sqrt {D}}}[\\cos \\langle w_{1},x\\rangle ,\\sin \\langle w_{1},x\\rangle ,\\cdots \\cos \\langle w_{D},x\\rangle ,\\sin \\langle w_{D},x\\rangle ]^{T}}\n  \nwhere \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          w\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        .\n        .\n        .\n        ,\n        \n          w\n          \n            D\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle w_{1},...,w_{D}}\n  \n are independent samples from the normal distribution \n  \n    \n      \n        N\n        (\n        0\n        ,\n        \n          \u03c3\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        I\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle N(0,\\sigma ^{2}I)}\n  \n.

A 2022 study found that Transformers pretrained only on natural language can be finetuned on only 0.03% of parameters and become competitive with LSTMs on a variety of logical and visual tasks, demonstrating transfer learning. The LLaVA was a vision-language model composed of a language model (Vicuna-13B) and a vision model (ViT-L/14), connected by a linear layer. Only the linear layer is finetuned.\nVision transformers adapt the transformer to computer vision by breaking down input images as a series of patches, turning them into vectors, and treating them like tokens in a standard transformer.\nConformer and later Whisper follow the same pattern for speech recognition, first turning the speech signal into a spectrogram, which is then treated like an image, i.e. broken down into a series of patches, turned into vectors and treated like tokens in a standard transformer.\nPerceivers are a variant of Transformers designed for multimodality.\nFor image generation, notable architectures are DALL-E 1 (2021), Parti (2022), Phenaki (2023), and Muse (2023). Unlike later models, DALL-E is not a diffusion model. Instead, it uses a decoder-only Transformer that autoregressively generates a text, followed by the token representation of an image, which is then converted by a variational autoencoder to an image. Parti is an encoder-decoder Transformer, where the encoder processes a text prompt, and the decoder generates a token representation of an image. Muse is an encoder-only Transformer that is trained to predict masked image tokens from unmasked image tokens. During generation, all input tokens are masked, and the highest-confidence predictions are included for the next iteration, until all tokens are predicted. Phenaki is a text-to-video model. It is a bidirectional masked transformer conditioned on pre-computed text tokens. The generated tokens are then decoded to a video.Applications\nThe transformer has had great success in natural language processing (NLP). Many large language models such as GPT-2, GPT-3, GPT-4, Gemini, AlbertAGPT, Claude, BERT, Grok, XLNet, RoBERTa and ChatGPT demonstrate the ability of transformers to perform a wide variety of NLP-related subtasks and their related real-world applications, including:\n\nmachine translation\ntime series prediction\ndocument summarization\ndocument generation\nnamed entity recognition (NER)\nwriting computer code based on requirements expressed in natural language.\nspeech-to-text\nBeyond traditional NLP, the transformer architecture has had success in other applications, such as:\n\nbiological sequence analysis\nvideo understanding\nprotein folding (such as AlphaFold)\nevaluating chess board positions. Using static evaluation alone (that is, with no Minimax search) transformer achieved an Elo of 2895, putting it at grandmaster level.See also\nseq2seq \u2013 Family of machine learning approaches\nPerceiver \u2013 Variant of Transformer designed for multimodal data\nVision transformer \u2013 Machine learning model for vision processing\nLarge language model \u2013 Type of machine learning model\nBERT (language model) \u2013 Series of language models developed by Google AI\nGenerative pre-trained transformer \u2013 Type of large language model\nT5 (language model) \u2013 Series of large language models developed by Google AINotes\nReferences\n== Further reading ==", "result": "# Transformer (deep learning architecture)\n\nIn deep learning, the transformer is an architecture for sequence modeling that relies on self-attention to compute context-dependent representations of its input.

This paper won the Best Paper Award at NeurIPS 2017. The transformer model was introduced as an alternative to recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which had previously dominated the field of natural language processing. The paper was motivated by the desire to develop a model that could handle longer sequences than RNNs and CNNs, while still maintaining the ability to capture long-range dependencies in the input sequence. The transformer model was originally developed for processing free-form text. It has since been generalized to other sequence data, such as time series data and speech data.\n\nThe Transformer model has since become one of the most widely used models for natural language processing tasks. It has been used to develop a variety of large language models, such as GPT-3, which are used for a variety of natural language processing tasks, such as language translation and question answering. The Transformer model has also been used in a variety of other domains, such as computer vision and speech recognition.\n\n--- Predecessors\n\nBefore the transformer architecture, there were many different approaches to sequence modeling. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) were one of the earliest approaches to sequence modeling. They were able to capture long-range dependencies in the input sequence, but they suffered from the vanishing gradient problem, which made it difficult to train them on long sequences. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks were later introduced as a way to address the vanishing gradient problem in RNNs. LSTMs were able to capture long-range dependencies in the input sequence, but they were still limited by the fact that they processed the input sequence sequentially, which made them slow to train and test. In addition, LSTMs were only able to capture dependencies within a single sequence, and were not able to capture dependencies between sequences.\n\nConvolutional neural networks (CNNs) were another approach to sequence modeling. CNNs were originally developed for image processing, but they were later adapted for sequence modeling. CNNs were able to capture local dependencies in the input sequence, but they were not able to capture long-range dependencies. In addition, CNNs were limited by the fact that they were only able to capture dependencies within a single sequence, and were not able to capture dependencies between sequences.\n\n--- Attention with seq2seq\n\nPrior to the transformer, encoder-decoder sequence transduction models were typically implemented as recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Encoder-decoder models were originally proposed by Luong et al.\u00a0<cit.> in 2015. The attention mechanism was originally proposed by Bahdanau et al.\u00a0<cit.> in 2015. The attention mechanism was first applied to encoder-decoder models by Cho et al.\u00a0<cit.> in 2014. The attention mechanism was then further refined by Luong et al.\u00a0<cit.> in 2015. The attention mechanism was originally proposed as a way to improve the performance of encoder-decoder models.
