Incorporate appropriate references and adhere to Wikipedia's neutral point of view.", "input": "", "output": "Introduction\nNamed-entity recognition (NER) (also known as (named) entity identification, entity chunking, and entity extraction) is a subtask of information extraction that seeks to locate and classify named entities mentioned in unstructured text into pre-defined categories such as person names, organizations, locations, medical codes, time expressions, quantities, monetary values, percentages, etc.\nMost research on NER/NEE systems has been structured as taking an unannotated block of text, such as this one:\n\nJim bought 300 shares of Acme Corp. in 2006.\nAnd producing an annotated block of text that highlights the names of entities:\n\n[Jim]Person bought 300 shares of [Acme Corp.]Organization in [2006]Time.\nIn this example, a person name consisting of one token, a two-token company name and a temporal expression have been detected and classified.\nState-of-the-art NER systems for English produce near-human performance. For example, the best system entering MUC-7 scored 93.39% of F-measure while human annotators scored 97.60% and 96.95%.Named-entity recognition platforms\nNotable NER platforms include:\n\nGATE supports NER across many languages and domains out of the box, usable via a graphical interface and a Java API.\nOpenNLP includes rule-based and statistical named-entity recognition.\nSpaCy features fast statistical NER as well as an open-source named-entity visualizer.\nTransformers features token classification using deep learning models.Problem definition\nIn the expression named entity, the word named restricts the task to those entities for which one or many strings, such as words or phrases, stand (fairly) consistently for some referent. This is closely related to rigid designators, as defined by Kripke, although in practice NER deals with many names and referents that are not philosophically \"rigid\". For instance, the automotive company created by Henry Ford in 1903 can be referred to as Ford or Ford Motor Company, although \"Ford\" can refer to many other entities as well (see Ford). Rigid designators include proper names as well as terms for certain biological species and substances, but exclude pronouns (such as \"it\"; see coreference resolution), descriptions that pick out a referent by its properties (see also De dicto and de re), and names for kinds of things as opposed to individuals (for example \"Bank\").\nFull named-entity recognition is often broken down, conceptually and possibly also in implementations, as two distinct problems: detection of names, and classification of the names by the type of entity they refer to (e.g. person, organization, or location).\nThe first phase is typically simplified to a segmentation problem: names are defined to be contiguous spans of tokens, with no nesting, so that \"Bank of America\" is a single name, disregarding the fact that inside this name, the substring \"America\" is itself a name. This segmentation problem is formally similar to chunking. The second phase requires choosing an ontology by which to organize categories of things.\nTemporal expressions and some numerical expressions (e.g., money, percentages, etc.) may also be considered as named entities in the context of the NER task. While some instances of these types are good examples of rigid designators (e.g., the year 2001) there are also many invalid ones (e.g., I take my vacations in \u201cJune\u201d). In the first case, the year 2001 refers to the 2001st year of the Gregorian calendar. In the second case, the month June may refer to the month of an undefined year (past June, next June, every June, etc.). It is arguable that the definition of named entity is loosened in such cases for practical reasons. The definition of the term named entity is therefore not strict and often has to be explained in the context in which it is used.\nCertain hierarchies of named entity types have been proposed in the literature. BBN categories, proposed in 2002, are used for question answering and consists of 29 types and 64 subtypes. Sekine's extended hierarchy, proposed in 2002, is made of 200 subtypes. More recently, in 2011 Ritter used a hierarchy based on common Freebase entity types in ground-breaking experiments on NER over social media text.Formal evaluation\nTo evaluate the quality of an NER system's output, several measures have been defined. The usual measures are called precision, recall, and F1 score. However, several issues remain in just how to calculate those values.\nThese statistical measures work reasonably well for the obvious cases of finding or missing a real entity exactly; and for finding a non-entity. However, NER can fail in many other ways, many of which are arguably \"partially correct\", and should not be counted as complete success or failures. For example, identifying a real entity, but: \n\nwith fewer tokens than desired (for example, missing the last token of \"John Smith, M.D.\")\nwith more tokens than desired (for example, including the first word of \"The University of MD\")\npartitioning adjacent entities differently (for example, treating \"Smith, Jones Robinson\" as 2 vs. 3 entities)\nassigning it a completely wrong type (for example, calling a personal name an organization)\nassigning it a related but inexact type (for example, \"substance\" vs. \"drug\", or \"school\" vs. \"organization\")\ncorrectly identifying an entity, when what the user wanted was a smaller- or larger-scope entity (for example, identifying \"James Madison\" as a personal name, when it's part of \"James Madison University\"). Some NER systems impose the restriction that entities may never overlap or nest, which means that in some cases one must make arbitrary or task-specific choices.\nOne overly simple method of measuring accuracy is merely to count what fraction of all tokens in the text were correctly or incorrectly identified as part of entity references (or as being entities of the correct type). This suffers from at least two problems: first, the vast majority of tokens in real-world text are not part of entity names, so the baseline accuracy (always predict \"not an entity\") is extravagantly high, typically >90%; and second, mispredicting the full span of an entity name is not properly penalized (finding only a person's first name when his last name follows might be scored as \u00bd accuracy).\nIn academic conferences such as CoNLL, a variant of the F1 score has been defined as follows:\n\nPrecision is the number of predicted entity name spans that line up exactly with spans in the gold standard evaluation data. I.e. when [Person Hans] [Person Blick] is predicted but [Person Hans Blick] was required, precision for the predicted name is zero. Precision is then averaged over all predicted entity names.\nRecall is similarly the number of names in the gold standard that appear at exactly the same location in the predictions.\nF1 score is the harmonic mean of these two.\nIt follows from the above definition that any prediction that misses a single token, includes a spurious token, or has the wrong class, is a hard error and does not contribute positively to either precision or recall. Thus, this measure may be said to be pessimistic: it can be the case that many \"errors\" are close to correct, and might be adequate for a given purpose. For example, one system might always omit titles such as \"Ms.\" or \"Ph.D.\", but be compared to a system or ground-truth data that expects titles to be included. In that case, every such name is treated as an error. Because of such issues, it is important actually to examine the kinds of errors, and decide how important they are given one's goals and requirements.\nEvaluation models based on a token-by-token matching have been proposed. Such models may be given partial credit for overlapping matches (such as using the Intersection over Union criterion). They allow a finer grained evaluation and comparison of extraction systems.Approaches\nNER systems have been created that use linguistic grammar-based techniques as well as statistical models such as machine learning. Hand-crafted grammar-based systems typically obtain better precision, but at the cost of lower recall and months of work by experienced computational linguists. Statistical NER systems typically require a large amount of manually annotated training data. Semisupervised approaches have been suggested to avoid part of the annotation effort.\nMany different classifier types have been used to perform machine-learned NER, with conditional random fields being a typical choice.Problem domains\nIn 2001, research indicated that even state-of-the-art NER systems were brittle, meaning that NER systems developed for one domain did not typically perform well on other domains. Considerable effort is involved in tuning NER systems to perform well in a new domain; this is true for both rule-based and trainable statistical systems.\nEarly work in NER systems in the 1990s was aimed primarily at extraction from journalistic articles. Attention then turned to processing of military dispatches and reports. Later stages of the automatic content extraction (ACE) evaluation also included several types of informal text styles, such as weblogs and text transcripts from conversational telephone speech conversations. Since about 1998, there has been a great deal of interest in entity identification in the molecular biology, bioinformatics, and medical natural language processing communities.  The most common entity of interest in that domain has been names of genes and gene products. There has been also considerable interest in the recognition of chemical entities and drugs in the context of the CHEMDNER\ncompetition, with 27 teams participating in this task.Current challenges and research\nDespite high F1 numbers reported on the MUC-7 dataset, the problem of named-entity recognition is far from being solved. The main efforts are directed to reducing the annotations labor by employing semi-supervised learning, robust performance across domains and scaling up to fine-grained entity types. In recent years, many projects have turned to crowdsourcing, which is a promising solution to obtain high-quality aggregate human judgments for supervised and semi-supervised machine learning approaches to NER. Another challenging task is devising models to deal with linguistically complex contexts such as Twitter and search queries.\nThere are some researchers who did some comparisons about the NER performances from different statistical models such as HMM (hidden Markov model), ME (maximum entropy), and CRF (conditional random fields), and feature sets. And some researchers recently proposed graph-based semi-supervised learning model for language specific NER tasks.\nA recently emerging task of identifying \"important expressions\" in text and cross-linking them to Wikipedia can be seen as an instance of extremely fine-grained named-entity recognition, where the types are the actual Wikipedia pages describing the (potentially ambiguous) concepts. Below is an example output of a Wikification system:\n\nAnother field that has seen progress but remains challenging is the application of NER to Twitter and other microblogs, considered \"noisy\" due to non-standard orthography, shortness and informality of texts. NER challenges in English Tweets have been organized by research communities to compare performances of various approaches, such as bidirectional LSTMs, Learning-to-Search, or CRFs.See also\nControlled vocabulary\nCoreference resolution\nEntity linking (aka named entity normalization, entity disambiguation)\nInformation extraction\nKnowledge extraction\nOnomastics\nRecord linkage\nSmart tag (Microsoft)\n\n\n== References ==", "result": "# Named-entity recognition\n\nNamed-entity recognition (NER), also known as entity identification, entity extraction and entity chunking, is a task of information extraction which aims to automatically find named entities in unstructured text, such as names of persons, organizations, locations, expressions of timex, and many others. A named entity recognized by NER systems is a word or a phrase that is assumed to be a name for a real-world object. For example, the expression \"Joe Bloggs\" can be assumed to be a name for a real person, and thus it is a named entity.\n\nTypically, an NER system is a component of a larger system, for example, an information extraction (IE) system, and it follows (or precedes) other steps of processing, such as part-of-speech tagging, parsing, and relation extraction. However, being just a word or a phrase, a named entity can be very easily represented in a database, hence many named-entity recognition systems are standalone systems.\n\nState-of-the-art NER systems for English attain performances (measured by F1-score) comparable to the best systems built by human experts for simple domains such as MUC-7. For more challenging domains, the performances of automatic and human expert systems start to separate.\n\n Named-entity recognition platforms\n\nThere are several named-entity recognition platforms that have been developed for different languages and domains. They may vary in the types of named entities recognized, the format of input and output, and the degree of user interaction (from fully automatic and requiring no human intervention to fully interactive and requiring extensive human supervision), as well as in the underlying approach and methodology.\n\n* GATE is a framework for building language analysis tools. It comes with a set of tools for performing basic tasks in text mining and named entity recognition.\n* OpenNLP is a collection of natural language processing tools. The OpenNLP maximum entropy package includes named entity recognition.\n* Spacy is a free library developed by Explosion AI that focuses on speed and efficiency.\n* Stanford NER is a highly accurate implementation written in Java.\n* Apache UIMA is a framework for creating processing pipelines. It provides several annotators for performing named entity recognition.\n* NLTK is a Python library for natural language processing. It contains a basic named entity recognition tool which uses regular expressions, and an interface to the Stanford NER tagger.\n* The CoNLL 2003 shared task provided a shared evaluation platform for named-entity recognition systems. It offers data sets in three languages: English, German and Spanish.\n* The CoNLL 2012 shared task focused on named-entity recognition in social media.\n* The ACE 2005 shared task offered a large data set for named-entity recognition and relation extraction in the domain of American politics.\n* The CONLL 2002 shared task offers a data set with named entities in the biomedical domain.\n* The NERDL shared task offers data sets across multiple domains for named-entity recognition in Polish.\n* The Bioner shared task offers data sets for biomedical named-entity recognition.\n* The Langstone et al. (2009) system provides a Java implementation of a statistical named-entity recogniser that achieves state-of-the-art results on the CoNLL 2003 corpus.\n* The IE 2.0 system provides a web-based named-entity recognition service that allows the user to annotate text semi-automatically and choose between several named-entity recognition systems.\n* The LingPipe library is a Java-based library with a suite of tools for natural language processing, including named entity recognition.\n* The Apache OpenNLP project provides a named entity recognition tool via a maximum entropy model.\n* The python-opennlp library provides a wrapper for the Apache OpenNLP named entity recognition model.\n* The Lingua::EN::NamedEntity Perl module does named entity recognition using external tools.\n* The MyRL library provides a graphical interface to the Stanford NER, IOB and crf Perl libraries.\n* The crf Perl library provides routines for creating a tagged corpus for named entity recognition and can also be used to train a named entity recognition system.\n* The R package openNLP provides the functionality of the Apache OpenNLP named entity tagger.\n* The R package namedentityr provides a wrapper for the online web-based Linguee named entity recognition service.\n* The spaCy library provides neural network-based models for named entity recognition.\n* The Pattern Python module provides a simple named entity recognizer that tags co-occuring named entities.\n* The NLTK Python module provides a simple named entity tagger which uses a regular expression based approach, and a interface to the Stanford Named Entity Recogniser.\n* The Hugging Face Transformers library provides several pre-trained models for named entity recognition.\n* The DeepPavlov library provides several pre-trained models for named entity recognition.\n* The AllenNLP library provides pre-trained models for named entity recognition.\n* The Langchain library provides several pre-trained models for named entity recognition.\n\n Problem definition\n\nThe problem of named-entity recognition is usually defined as a sequence labeling problem. An input text is split into a sequence of tokens (words or subwords), and each token is assigned with a label indicating whether it is a named entity or not. For example, for the sentence\n\n   Joe Bloggs lives in Menlo Park.\n\nan ideal named-entity recognition system would assign the labels\n\n   Joe Bloggs       B-Person L-Person   O   B-Location L-Location .\n\nwhere the label O indicates that the token is not a named entity (also referred to as background).\n\nIn practice, named-entity recognition systems rarely achieve 100% accuracy even on relatively simple corpora. Thus, the definition above is often extended so that some tokens are considered to be inside a named entity. In this setting, the output label sequence would be\n\n   B-Person I-Person I-Person   O   B-Location I-Location I-Location .\n\nwhere the label I-Person indicates that the token is inside a person's name.\n\nThis problem definition has several advantages: it allows to evaluate the performance of a named-entity recognition system using standard metrics for sequence labeling, such as accuracy, precision, recall and F1; it is suitable for using standard machine learning algorithms, such as conditional random fields, maximum entropy, and support vector machines; and it is easy to understand and implement. Most current named-entity recognition systems follow this definition.\n\n--- Rigid vs. non-rigid designations\n\nNamed-entity designations are often assumed to be rigid, i.e., they are assumed to correspond to designations in an external, ideally universal, knowledge base. In the example above, \"Joe Bloggs\" and \"Menlo Park\" are assumed to refer to particular persons and locations which are already present in the knowledge base. This assumption allows to use named entities as variables in further reasoning about the content of the text. On the other hand, sometimes it is necessary to recognize non-rigid designations, e.g., when a company is mentioned by its full name, abbreviation, acronym, or when made-up or hypothetical entities are referred to. Non-rigid entity recognition is closely related to other tasks such as paraphrase identification, entity linking, and intra-document coreference resolution.\n\n--- Types of named entities\n\nIn general, there are two types of named entities: those that involve some form of redundancy and those that do not. For the former, the redundancy serves as confirmation that a mention refers to the same underlying entity, while for the latter, all of the mentions are independent references.\n\nFor example, consider the following sentence:\n\n   General Motors announced plans to build a new plant in Michigan .\n\nThere is only one organization referred to, namely the company General Motors. Both occurrences of General Motors are redundant; if one were to appear in a text, the other would probably be as well. If one could be removed, the other would still be meaningful. However, the entity Michigan is a proper noun and thus non-redundant. It could in theory appear without the preceding General Motors, but it would be much more difficult for a reader to understand. Because the first occurrence of an entity can provide context for subsequent non-redundant mentions, some researchers treat the first mention of an entity as redundant and all subsequent mentions as non-redundant. This makes it possible to frame named-entity recognition as a multi-class classification problem.\n\nThere are many types of named entities. Some examples are:\n\n* Person names (e.g., Barack Obama)\n* Organization names (e.g., Google, Microsoft Corporation)\n* Location names (e.g., Menlo Park, California)\n* Expressions of timex (e.g., yesterday, next Friday)\n* Numeric expressions (e.g., 42, 100 light-years)\n* Monetary expressions (e.g., $42, 100 dollars)\n* Percent expressions (e.g., 42%, fourty-two percent)\n* Dates (e.g., June 23, 2005)\n* Times (e.g., 18:30, six o'clock in the evening)\n* Time periods (e.g., morning, daytime, the 80s)\n* Product names (e.g., iPad, iPhone X)\n* Academic degree (e.g., PhD, Bachelor of Science)\n* Languages (e.g., English, Chinese)\n* Nationality (e.g., American, Mexican)\n* Occupation (e.g., doctor, actress)\n* Species (e.g., Canis lupus familiaris)\n* Measures (e.g., light-year, liter)\n* Vessel (e.g., SS Titanic)\n* Airport (e.g., JFK Airport)\n* Phone number (e.g., +1-650-432-3300)\n* E-mail (e.g., john@doe.com)\n* URL (e.g., <https://www.example.com/>\n* IP address (e.g., 192.168.0.1)\n\nThese are the main types of named entities found in many domain-specific corpora. The exact definitions and the set of named entity types depend heavily on the domain, and to what the text refers. For example, in the sentence\n\n   Bayer sees China as a key market for its agro business\n\nthe word Bayer refers to Bayer AG, a German multinational chemical corporation, and China is a location, however, in other sentences, the word Bayer could refer to a different entity, or it might not refer to any entity at all.\n\n Formal evaluation\n\nA named-entity recognition system takes a text as input and produces annotated text as output. The output is usually in the form of a string where each word is preceded by a label. For example, the output for the sentence Joe Bloggs lives in Menlo Park. could be $B-Person$ Joe $I-Person$ Bloggs lives in $B-Location$ Menlo $I-Location$ Park . . Here, the symbols $B-Person$, $I-Person$ etc. are used to indicate the labels assigned to the corresponding words. Usually, however, named-entity recognition systems output something that resembles plain text, with the named entities displayed in uppercase or in a different color. Ideally, the original text and the annotated text should be identical from the semantic point of view.\n\nThe quality of a named-entity recognition system is usually evaluated by comparing the output against the gold standard \u2013 the set of named entities marked up in the original text by human annotators. There are three main ways of doing this: automatic evaluation using a script, manual evaluation, and evaluation using a web interface.\n\n--- Automatic evaluation\n\nThe simplest way of evaluating the performance of a named-entity recognition system is to count the number of true positives, false positives, and false negatives and calculate the corresponding precision, recall, and F1. This is easily done using a simple script. For example, to count the number of true positives one could use a command like\n\n   grep -E -o \\(O\\|B-PERSON\\|I-PERSON\\|B-LOCATION\\|I-LOCATION\\|B-ORGANIZATION\\|I-ORGANIZATION\\) file1.conll file2.conll\n\nwhere file1.conll is the gold standard and file2.conll is the output of the named-entity recognition system. This method is fast and requires minimal effort, but it is not very accurate, since it is difficult to come up with regular expressions that would correctly count true positives, false positives, and false negatives.\n\n--- Manual evaluation\n\nIn manual evaluation, the output of the named-entity recognition system is presented in a form that is different from that of the gold standard. Typically, the named entities are displayed in uppercase or in a different color. Two or more people inspect the output and mark all false positives and false negatives. This can be done using a web interface. The web interface can also be used to perform the automatic evaluation.\n\nEvaluation involves inspecting the output of the named-entity recognition system and marking every instance of false positives and false negatives. This can be time-consuming and expensive.\n\n--- Evaluation using a web interface\n\nThe easiest way to perform the evaluation using a web interface is to display the text of the document and highlight the named entities in a color different from the color of the text. Two people, the annotator and the verifier then inspect the text and discuss and mark every instance of false positives and false negatives. The annotator marks the text, and the verifier checks whether the annotations are correct. This process continues until there are no more unmarked named entities in the text. Every person who participates in the evaluation has an account and his or her own color. This way, it is possible to reconstruct who has annotated which part of the text. This information is useful when it is necessary to evaluate the performance of individual annotators.\n\nA more sophisticated approach involves displaying the original text side-by-side with the annotations in a web browser. The web page should allow the annotators to move back and forth between the original text and the annotated text, and it should allow the verifier to mark false positives and false negatives. It should also allow the annotator to mark words or expressions that should not be considered as named entities, e.g., proper nouns that do not refer to anything or expressions like the first forty to fifty meters that refer to physical quantities. It should be possible to attach comments to individual annotations. Finally, it should be possible to export the annotations to a file and import annotations from a file.\n\n Approaches\n\nThere are two main approaches to named-entity recognition: linguistic grammar-based and statistical.\n\n--- Linguistic grammar-based\n\nLinguistic grammar-based named-entity recognition systems are usually rule-based and rely on syntactic and semantic analysis of the text. The text is parsed, and the parser examines the syntactic structure of the text and the semantic roles of the arguments. In some cases, it may be necessary to combine the results of parsing with other linguistic observations, such as collocations. The results of the parsing are then inspected by a named-entity recognition module which applies a set of rules describing the syntactic and semantic properties of named entities. These rules can be based on expert knowledge or they can be generated using machine learning. The final output is produced by a renderer which formats the results in a more readable way.\n\nThe main advantage of linguistic grammar-based systems is that they are accurate and flexible. With enough time and money, it is possible to recognize almost any type of named entity in any domain. Another advantage is that it is possible to include ad hoc knowledge about special types of named entities in the form of special-purpose rules.\n\nThe main disadvantage of linguistic grammar-based systems is that they are complex and time-consuming to build. It may take months or even years before a system reaches acceptable accuracy. Another disadvantage is that the resulting system is inflexible and can rarely be easily adapted to recognizing a different type of named entity or applied to a different domain.\n\nLinguistic grammar-based systems are recommended for situations where it is necessary to recognize a large variety of named entities in a single domain, where there is enough time and money available, and where the results can be verified using a web interface.\n\n--- Statistical\n\nStatistical named-entity recognition systems are usually fully automatic and rely on machine learning. The text is analyzed using a parser or a tokenizer and a tagger, and the parser, tokenizer, and tagger produce a sequence of words with part-of-speech tags, such as This/DT is/BE Mr./NNP Bloggs/NNP . . The resulting sequence of words and their part-of-speech tags is then used as input to a classifier, which was trained on a corpus of previously labeled examples. Depending on the type of classifier used, it may be necessary to transform the input data into feature vectors. Finally, the output of the classifier is postprocessed to ensure that the beginning and end of each named entity is properly marked.\n\nThe main advantage of statistical named-entity recognition systems is that they are fast and require little or no supervision. It is possible to obtain reasonable results by training a new classifier on a small set of manually verified examples. Another advantage is that it is relatively easy to apply such systems to a different domain or to a different type of named entity.\n\nThe main disadvantage of statistical named-entity recognition systems is that they usually achieve lower accuracy than equivalent linguistic grammar-based systems. It is usually difficult to determine the reason why the system made a particular mistake, which makes it difficult to improve its accuracy.\n\nStatistical named-entity recognition systems are recommended for situations where it is necessary to quickly obtain somewhat inaccurate results or where there is little domain-specific data available.\n\n Problem domains\n\nMany named-entity recognition systems are domain-specific, i.e., the training data was obtained from a specific domain such as biomedicine, military documents, or financial news. It is very difficult to build a general-purpose named-entity recognition system that would achieve reasonable accuracy when applied to completely different domains. This is because the space of possible named entities is very large and it is difficult to determine in advance which types of named entities are likely to occur in a given domain. For example, if the domain consists of financial news, it may be necessary to deal with different types of stocks, bonds, and currencies, whereas in other domains these would be treated as common nouns.\n\nIt is often necessary to retrain or fine-tune a named-entity recognition system when it is applied to a corpus that significantly differs from the training data. For example, the same system can be used to extract company names from a corpus of financial news and from a social media feed, but it will have to be retrained to recognize persons' names. Similarly, a system trained on medical texts can be used to extract medical terms from new medical texts, but it will have to be retrained to extract terms that are specific to the new domain. The same applies to domain-specific jargon and idioms; they have to be learned from scratch or by fine-tuning.\n\n--- Juxtaposed expressions\n\nAnother difficulty arises when the attributes of two or more named entities are juxtaposed. For example, the phrase New York Stock Exchange may be labeled as a location and an organization in most domains, but in financial domain it is mostly labeled as an organization.\n\n Current challenges and research\n\nAlthough modern NER systems can achieve very high F1 scores (around 97%) on the CONLL 2003 corpus\u00a0<cit.>, the performance of NER systems drops significantly (<20%) when applying to a domain different from the training domain. This is due to the lack of annotated data from the target domain. Although it is possible to obtain high performance in specific domains by heavily relying on human supervision to annotate data\u00a0<cit.>, the cost of annotation makes it prohibitive. Therefore, there is a need to develop NER systems that require little to no supervision.\n\nSemi-supervised learning is an active area of research that can significantly reduce the amount of annotation needed. One approach is to construct a generative model of background text (non-NER) by sampling from the corpus and fitting a language model to this data. This model can then be used to encourage diversity among background words by penalizing them with low probabilities. Another approach is to use a discriminatively trained part-of-speech (POS) tagger\u00a0<cit.>. POS tagging and NER are closely related tasks, so utilizing a POS tagger in a semi-supervised manner can help improve performance. In this approach, a generative model of the POS tagger is constructed and used to constrain the decoding step of the NER system to only paths with likely POS tags.\n\nAnother line of research is to utilize deep learning models such as a bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM). These models have shown great success in many NLP tasks. The BiLSTM outputs hidden states for each time step which can be used as features for each token. These hidden states can be passed to a fully connected neural network for the classification output. One challenge with deep learning models is the lack of annotated data. To combat this, data augmentation techniques have been used to artificially increase the amount of training data. In this approach, data is augmented by utilizing the outputs from the BiLSTM NER system and then re-labeling the predicted labels. This creates a feedback loop that gradually increases the performance of the BiLSTM. As neural networks become more prevalent in NLP tasks, there is growing interest in combining transfer learning and deep learning. For example, the ELMo representation can be combined with a BiLSTM-NER model by feeding the ELMo vector for each token and having the BiLSTM learn the transition probabilities between NER labels.\n\nSee also\n\n* Information extraction\n* Information retrieval\n* Linking\n* Machine learning\n* Relation extraction\n* Sentiment analysis\n* Speech recognition\n* Text mining\n* Tokenization\n"}, {"instruction": "You are an AI editor writing a complete Wikipedia article that adheres to Wikipedia's content standards.

Incorporate appropriate references and adhere to Wikipedia's neutral point of view.", "input": "", "output": "Introduction\nA large language model (LLM) is a type of machine learning model designed for natural language processing tasks such as language generation. LLMs are language models with many parameters, and are trained with self-supervised learning on a vast amount of text.\nThe largest and most capable LLMs are generative pretrained transformers (GPTs). Modern models can be fine-tuned for specific tasks or guided by prompt engineering. These models acquire predictive power regarding syntax, semantics, and ontologies inherent in human language corpora, but they also inherit inaccuracies and biases present in the data they are trained in.History\nBefore 2017, there were a few language models that were large as compared to capacities then available. In the 1990s, the IBM alignment models pioneered statistical language modelling. A smoothed n-gram model in 2001 trained on 0.3 billion words achieved state-of-the-art perplexity at the time. In the 2000s, as Internet use became prevalent, some researchers constructed Internet-scale language datasets (\"web as corpus\"), upon which they trained statistical language models. In 2009, in most language processing tasks, statistical language models dominated over symbolic language models because they can usefully ingest large datasets.\n\nAfter neural networks became dominant in image processing around 2012, they were applied to language modelling as well. Google converted its translation service to Neural Machine Translation in 2016. Because it preceded the existence of transformers, it was done by seq2seq deep LSTM networks.\nAt the 2017 NeurIPS conference, Google researchers introduced the transformer architecture in their landmark paper \"Attention Is All You Need\". This paper's goal was to improve upon 2014 seq2seq technology, and was based mainly on the attention mechanism developed by Bahdanau et al. in 2014. The following year in 2018, BERT was introduced and quickly became \"ubiquitous\". Though the original transformer has both encoder and decoder blocks, BERT is an encoder-only model. Academic and research usage of BERT began to decline in 2023, following rapid improvements in the abilities of decoder-only models (such as GPT) to solve tasks via prompting.\nAlthough decoder-only GPT-1 was introduced in 2018, it was GPT-2 in 2019 that caught widespread attention because OpenAI at first deemed it too powerful to release publicly, out of fear of malicious use. GPT-3 in 2020 went a step further and as of 2024 is available only via API with no offering of downloading the model to execute locally. But it was the 2022 consumer-facing browser-based ChatGPT that captured the imaginations of the general population and caused some media hype and online buzz. The 2023 GPT-4 was praised for its increased accuracy and as a \"holy grail\" for its multimodal capabilities. OpenAI did not reveal the high-level architecture and the number of parameters of GPT-4. The release of ChatGPT led to an uptick in LLM usage across several research subfields of computer science, including robotics, software engineering, and societal impact work. In 2024 OpenAI released the reasoning model OpenAI o1, which generates long chains of thought before returning a final answer.\nCompeting language models have for the most part been attempting to equal the GPT series, at least in terms of number of parameters.\nSince 2022, source-available models have been gaining popularity, especially at first with BLOOM and LLaMA, though both have restrictions on the field of use. Mistral AI's models Mistral 7B and Mixtral 8x7b have the more permissive Apache License. In January 2025, DeepSeek released DeepSeek R1, a 671-billion-parameter open-weight model that performs comparably to OpenAI o1 but at a much lower cost.\nSince 2023, many LLMs have been trained to be multimodal, having the ability to also process or generate other types of data, such as images or audio. These LLMs are also called large multimodal models (LMMs).\nAs of 2024, the largest and most capable models are all based on the transformer architecture. Some recent implementations are based on other architectures, such as recurrent neural network variants and Mamba (a state space model).Dataset preprocessing\nTokenization\nAs machine learning algorithms process numbers rather than text, the text must be converted to numbers. In the first step, a vocabulary is decided upon, then integer indices are arbitrarily but uniquely assigned to each vocabulary entry, and finally, an embedding is associated to the integer index. Algorithms include byte-pair encoding (BPE) and WordPiece. There are also special tokens serving as control characters, such as [MASK] for masked-out token (as used in BERT), and [UNK] (\"unknown\") for characters not appearing in the vocabulary. Also, some special symbols are used to denote special text formatting. For example, \"\u0120\" denotes a preceding whitespace in RoBERTa and GPT. \"##\" denotes continuation of a preceding word in BERT.\nFor example, the BPE tokenizer used by GPT-3 (Legacy) would split tokenizer: texts -> series of numerical \"tokens\" as\n\nTokenization also compresses the datasets. Because LLMs generally require input to be an array that is not jagged, the shorter texts must be \"padded\" until they match the length of the longest one. How many tokens are, on average, needed per word depends on the language of the dataset.BPE\nAs an example, consider a tokenizer based on byte-pair encoding. In the first step, all unique characters (including blanks and punctuation marks) are treated as an initial set of n-grams (i.e. initial set of uni-grams). Successively the most frequent pair of adjacent characters is merged into a bi-gram and all instances of the pair are replaced by it. All occurrences of adjacent pairs of (previously merged) n-grams that most frequently occur together are then again merged into even lengthier n-gram, until a vocabulary of prescribed size is obtained (in case of GPT-3, the size is 50257). After a tokenizer is trained, any text can be tokenized by it, as long as it does not contain characters not appearing in the initial-set of uni-grams.Problems\nA token vocabulary based on the frequencies extracted from mainly English corpora uses as few tokens as possible for an average English word. However, an average word in another language encoded by such an English-optimized tokenizer is split into a suboptimal amount of tokens. GPT-2 tokenizer can use up to 15 times more tokens per word for some languages, for example for the Shan language from Myanmar. Even more widespread languages such as Portuguese and German have \"a premium of 50%\" compared to English.\nGreedy tokenization also causes subtle problems with text completion.Dataset cleaning\nIn the context of training LLMs, datasets are typically cleaned by removing low-quality, duplicated, or toxic data. Cleaned datasets can increase training efficiency and lead to improved downstream performance. A trained LLM can be used to clean datasets for training a further LLM.\nWith the increasing proportion of LLM-generated content on the web, data cleaning in the future may include filtering out such content. LLM-generated content can pose a problem if the content is similar to human text (making filtering difficult) but of lower quality (degrading performance of models trained on it).Synthetic data\nTraining of largest language models might need more linguistic data than naturally available, or that the naturally occurring data is of insufficient quality. In these cases, synthetic data might be used. Microsoft's Phi series of LLMs is trained on textbook-like data generated by another LLM.Training and architecture\nReinforcement learning from human feedback\nReinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) through algorithms, such as proximal policy optimization, is used to further fine-tune a model based on a dataset of human preferences.Instruction tuning\nUsing \"self-instruct\" approaches, LLMs have been able to bootstrap correct responses, replacing any naive responses, starting from human-generated corrections of a few cases. For example, in the instruction \"Write an essay about the main themes represented in Hamlet,\" an initial naive completion might be \"If you submit the essay after March 17, your grade will be reduced by 10% for each day of delay,\" based on the frequency of this textual sequence in the corpus.Mixture of experts\nThe largest LLM may be too expensive to train and use directly. For such models, mixture of experts (MoE) can be applied, a line of research pursued by Google researchers since 2017 to train models reaching up to 1 trillion parameters.Prompt engineering, attention mechanism, and context window\nMost results previously achievable only by (costly) fine-tuning, can be achieved through prompt engineering, although limited to the scope of a single conversation (more precisely, limited to the scope of a context window).\n\nIn order to find out which tokens are relevant to each other within the scope of the context window, the attention mechanism calculates \"soft\" weights for each token, more precisely for its embedding, by using multiple attention heads, each with its own \"relevance\" for calculating its own soft weights. For example, the small (i.e. 117M parameter sized) GPT-2 model has had twelve attention heads and a context window of only 1k tokens. In its medium version it has 345M parameters and contains 24 layers, each with 12 attention heads. For the training with gradient descent a batch size of 512 was utilized.\nThe largest models, such as Google's Gemini 1.5, presented in February 2024, can have a context window sized up to 1 million (context window of 10 million was also \"successfully tested\"). Other models with large context windows includes Anthropic's Claude 2.1, with a context window of up to 200k tokens. Note that this maximum refers to the number of input tokens and that the maximum number of output tokens differs from the input and is often smaller. For example, the GPT-4 Turbo model has a maximum output of 4096 tokens.\nLength of a conversation that the model can take into account when generating its next answer is limited by the size of a context window, as well. If the length of a conversation, for example with ChatGPT, is longer than its context window, only the parts inside the context window are taken into account when generating the next answer, or the model needs to apply some algorithm to summarize the too distant parts of conversation.\nThe shortcomings of making a context window larger include higher computational cost and possibly diluting the focus on local context, while making it smaller can cause a model to miss an important long-range dependency. Balancing them is a matter of experimentation and domain-specific considerations.\nA model may be pre-trained either to predict how the segment continues, or what is missing in the segment, given a segment from its training dataset. It can be either\n\nautoregressive (i.e. predicting how the segment continues, as GPTs do): for example given a segment \"I like to eat\", the model predicts \"ice cream\", or \"sushi\".\n\"masked\" (i.e. filling in the parts missing from the segment, the way \"BERT\" does it): for example, given a segment \"I like to [__] [__] cream\", the model predicts that \"eat\" and \"ice\" are missing.\nModels may be trained on auxiliary tasks which test their understanding of the data distribution, such as Next Sentence Prediction (NSP), in which pairs of sentences are presented and the model must predict whether they appear consecutively in the training corpus. During training, regularization loss is also used to stabilize training. However regularization loss is usually not used during testing and evaluation.Infrastructure\nSubstantial infrastructure is necessary for training the largest models.Training cost\nThe qualifier \"large\" in \"large language model\" is inherently vague, as there is no definitive threshold for the number of parameters required to qualify as \"large\". As time goes on, what was previously considered \"large\" may evolve. GPT-1 of 2018 is usually considered the first LLM, even though it has only 0.117 billion parameters. The tendency towards larger models is visible in the list of large language models.\nAs technology advanced, large sums have been invested in increasingly large models. For example, training of the GPT-2 (i.e. a 1.5-billion-parameters model) in 2019 cost $50,000, while training of the PaLM (i.e. a 540-billion-parameters model) in 2022 cost $8 million, and Megatron-Turing NLG 530B (in 2021) cost around $11 million.\nFor Transformer-based LLM, training cost is much higher than inference cost. It costs 6 FLOPs per parameter to train on one token, whereas it costs 1 to 2 FLOPs per parameter to infer on one token.Tool use\nThere are certain tasks that, in principle, cannot be solved by any LLM, at least not without the use of external tools or additional software. An example of such a task is responding to the user's input '354 * 139 = ', provided that the LLM has not already encountered a continuation of this calculation in its training corpus. In such cases, the LLM needs to resort to running program code that calculates the result, which can then be included in its response.: Another example is \"What is the time now? It is \", where a separate program interpreter would need to execute a code to get system time on the computer, so that the LLM can include it in its reply. This basic strategy can be sophisticated with multiple attempts of generated programs, and other sampling strategies.\nGenerally, in order to get an LLM to use tools, one must fine-tune it for tool-use. If the number of tools is finite, then fine-tuning may be done just once. If the number of tools can grow arbitrarily, as with online API services, then the LLM can be fine-tuned to be able to read API documentation and call API correctly.\nRetrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is another approach that enhances LLMs by integrating them with document retrieval systems. Given a query, a document retriever is called to retrieve the most relevant documents. This is usually done by encoding the query and the documents into vectors, then finding the documents with vectors (usually stored in a vector database) most similar to the vector of the query. The LLM then generates an output based on both the query and context included from the retrieved documents.Agency\nAn LLM is typically not an autonomous agent by itself, as it lacks the ability to interact with dynamic environments, recall past behaviors, and plan future actions, but can be transformed into one by integrating modules like profiling, memory, planning, and action.\nThe ReAct pattern, a portmanteau of \"Reason + Act\", constructs an agent out of an LLM, using the LLM as a planner. The LLM is prompted to \"think out loud\". Specifically, the language model is prompted with a textual description of the environment, a goal, a list of possible actions, and a record of the actions and observations so far. It generates one or more thoughts before generating an action, which is then executed in the environment. The linguistic description of the environment given to the LLM planner can even be the LaTeX code of a paper describing the environment.\nIn the DEPS (\"Describe, Explain, Plan and Select\") method, an LLM is first connected to the visual world via image descriptions, then it is prompted to produce plans for complex tasks and behaviors based on its pretrained knowledge and environmental feedback it receives.\nThe Reflexion method constructs an agent that learns over multiple episodes. At the end of each episode, the LLM is given the record of the episode, and prompted to think up \"lessons learned\", which would help it perform better at a subsequent episode. These \"lessons learned\" are given to the agent in the subsequent episodes.\nMonte Carlo tree search can use an LLM as rollout heuristic. When a programmatic world model is not available, an LLM can also be prompted with a description of the environment to act as world model.\nFor open-ended exploration, an LLM can be used to score observations for their \"interestingness\", which can be used as a reward signal to guide a normal (non-LLM) reinforcement learning agent. Alternatively, it can propose increasingly difficult tasks for curriculum learning. Instead of outputting individual actions, an LLM planner can also construct \"skills\", or functions for complex action sequences. The skills can be stored and later invoked, allowing increasing levels of abstraction in planning.\nLLM-powered agents can keep a long-term memory of its previous contexts, and the memory can be retrieved in the same way as Retrieval Augmented Generation. Multiple such agents can interact socially.Compression\nTypically, LLMs are trained with single- or half-precision floating point numbers (float32 and float16). One float16 has 16 bits, or 2 bytes, and so one billion parameters require 2 gigabytes. The largest models typically have 100 billion parameters, requiring 200 gigabytes to load, which places them outside the range of most consumer electronics.\nPost-training quantization aims to decrease the space requirement by lowering precision of the parameters of a trained model, while preserving most of its performance. The simplest form of quantization simply truncates all numbers to a given number of bits. It can be improved by using a different quantization codebook per layer. Further improvement can be done by applying different precisions to different parameters, with higher precision for particularly important parameters (\"outlier weights\"). See the visual guide to quantization by Maarten Grootendorst for a visual depiction.\nWhile quantized models are typically frozen, and only pre-quantized models are fine-tuned, quantized models can still be fine-tuned.Multimodality\nMultimodality means \"having several modalities\", and a \"modality\" refers to a type of input or output, such as video, image, audio, text, proprioception, etc. There have been many AI models trained specifically to ingest one modality and output another modality, such as AlexNet for image to label, visual question answering for image-text to text, and speech recognition for speech to text.\nA common method to create multimodal models out of an LLM is to \"tokenize\" the output of a trained encoder. Concretely, one can construct an LLM that can understand images as follows: take a trained LLM, and take a trained image encoder \n  \n    \n      \n        E\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle E}\n  \n. Make a small multilayered perceptron \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f}\n  \n, so that for any image \n  \n    \n      \n        y\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle y}\n  \n, the post-processed vector \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        (\n        E\n        (\n        y\n        )\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f(E(y))}\n  \n has the same dimensions as an encoded token. That is an \"image token\". Then, one can interleave text tokens and image tokens. The compound model is then fine-tuned on an image-text dataset. This basic construction can be applied with more sophistication to improve the model. The image encoder may be frozen to improve stability.\nFlamingo demonstrated the effectiveness of the tokenization method, finetuning a pair of pretrained language model and image encoder to perform better on visual question answering than models trained from scratch. Google PaLM model was fine-tuned into a multimodal model PaLM-E using the tokenization method, and applied to robotic control. LLaMA models have also been turned multimodal using the tokenization method, to allow image inputs, and video inputs.\nGPT-4 can use both text and image as inputs (although the vision component was not released to the public until GPT-4V); Google DeepMind's Gemini is also multimodal.  Mistral introduced its own multimodel Pixtral 12B model in September 2024.Reasoning\nIn late 2024, a new direction emerged in LLM development with models specifically designed for complex reasoning tasks. These \"reasoning models\" were trained to spend more time generating step-by-step solutions before providing final answers, similar to human problem-solving processes.\nOpenAI introduced this trend with their o1 model in September 2024, followed by o3 in December 2024. These models showed significant improvements in mathematics, science, and coding tasks compared to traditional LLMs. For example, on International Mathematics Olympiad qualifying exam problems, GPT-4o achieved 13% accuracy while o1 reached 83%.\nIn January 2025, the Chinese company DeepSeek released DeepSeek-R1, a 671-billion-parameter open-weight reasoning model that achieved comparable performance to OpenAI's o1 while being significantly more cost-effective to operate. Unlike proprietary models from OpenAI, DeepSeek-R1's open-weight nature allowed researchers to study and build upon the algorithm, though its training data remained private.\nThese reasoning models typically require more computational resources per query compared to traditional LLMs, as they perform more extensive processing to work through problems step-by-step. However, they have shown superior capabilities in domains requiring structured logical thinking, such as mathematics, scientific research, and computer programming.\nEfforts to reduce or compensate for hallucinations have employed automated reasoning, RAG (retrieval-augmented generation), fine-tuning, and other methods.Properties\nScaling laws\nThe performance of an LLM after pretraining largely depends on the:\n\ncost of pretraining \n  \n    \n      \n        C\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle C}\n  \n (the total amount of compute used),\nsize of the artificial neural network itself, such as number of parameters \n  \n    \n      \n        N\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle N}\n  \n (i.e. amount of neurons in its layers, amount of weights between them and biases),\nsize of its pretraining dataset (i.e. number of tokens in corpus, \n  \n    \n      \n        D\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle D}\n  \n).\n\"Scaling laws\" are empirical statistical laws that predict LLM performance based on such factors. One particular scaling law (\"Chinchilla scaling\") for LLM autoregressively trained for one epoch, with a log-log learning rate schedule, states that:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            {\n            \n              \n                \n                  C\n                  =\n                  \n                    C\n                    \n                      0\n                    \n                  \n                  N\n                  D\n                \n              \n              \n                \n                  L\n                  =\n                  \n                    \n                      A\n                      \n                        N\n                        \n                          \u03b1\n                        \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                  +\n                  \n                    \n                      B\n                      \n                        D\n                        \n                          \u03b2\n                        \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                  +\n                  \n                    L\n                    \n                      0\n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\begin{cases}C=C_{0}ND\\\\[6pt]L={\\frac {A}{N^{\\alpha }}}+{\\frac {B}{D^{\\beta }}}+L_{0}\\end{cases}}}\n  \n where the variables are\n\n  \n    \n      \n        C\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle C}\n  \n is the cost of training the model, in FLOPs.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        N\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle N}\n  \n is the number of parameters in the model.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        D\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle D}\n  \n is the number of tokens in the training set.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        L\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle L}\n  \n is the average negative log-likelihood loss per token (nats/token), achieved by the trained LLM on the test dataset.\nand the statistical hyper-parameters are\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          C\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n        =\n        6\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle C_{0}=6}\n  \n, meaning that it costs 6 FLOPs per parameter to train on one token.

However, this linearity may be punctuated by \"break(s)\" in the scaling law, where the slope of the line changes abruptly, and where larger models acquire \"emergent abilities\". They arise from the complex interaction of the model's components and are not explicitly programmed or designed. \nFurthermore, recent research has demonstrated that AI systems, including large language models, can employ heuristic reasoning akin to human cognition. They balance between exhaustive logical processing and the use of cognitive shortcuts (heuristics), adapting their reasoning strategies to optimize between accuracy and effort. This behavior aligns with principles of resource-rational human cognition, as discussed in classical theories of bounded rationality and dual-process theory.\nOne of the emergent abilities is in-context learning from example demonstrations. In-context learning is involved in tasks, such as:\n\nreported arithmetics\ndecoding the International Phonetic Alphabet\nunscrambling a word's letters\ndisambiguating word-in-context datasets\nconverting spatial words\ncardinal directions (for example, replying \"northeast\" in response to a 3x3 grid of 8 zeros and a 1 in the top-right), color terms represented in text.\nchain-of-thought prompting: In a 2022 research paper, chain-of-thought prompting only improved the performance for models that had at least 62B. Smaller models perform better when prompted to answer immediately, without chain of thought.\nidentifying offensive content in paragraphs of Hinglish (a combination of Hindi and English), and generating a similar English equivalent of Kiswahili proverbs.\nSchaeffer et. al. argue that the emergent abilities are not unpredictably acquired, but predictably acquired according to a smooth scaling law. The authors considered a toy statistical model of an LLM solving multiple-choice questions, and showed that this statistical model, modified to account for other types of tasks, applies to these tasks as well.\nLet \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x}\n  \n be the number of parameter count, and \n  \n    \n      \n        y\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle y}\n  \n be the performance of the model.Interpretation\nLarge language models by themselves are black boxes, and it is not clear how they can perform linguistic tasks. Similarly, it is unclear if or how LLMs should be viewed as models of the human brain and/or human mind.\nVarious techniques have been developed to enhance the transparency and interpretability of LLMs. Mechanistic interpretability aims to reverse-engineer LLMs by discovering symbolic algorithms that approximate the inference performed by an LLM. In recent years, sparse coding models such as sparse autoencoders, transcoders, and crosscoders have emerged as promising tools for identifying interpretable features.Studying a replacement model\nTranscoders, which are more interpretable than transformers, have been utilized to develop \u201creplacement models.\u201d In one such study involving the mechanistic interpretation of writing a rhyming poem by an LLM, it was shown that although they are believed to simply predict the next token, they can, in fact, plan ahead.Explainability\nA related concept is AI explainability, which focuses on understanding how an AI model arrives at a given result. Techniques such as partial dependency plots, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), and feature importance assessments allow researchers to visualize and understand the contributions of various input features to the model's predictions. These methods help ensure that AI models make decisions based on relevant and fair criteria, enhancing trust and accountability.\nBy integrating these techniques, researchers and practitioners can gain deeper insights into the operations of LLMs, fostering trust and facilitating the responsible deployment of these powerful models.\nIn another example, the authors trained small transformers on modular arithmetic addition. The resulting models were reverse-engineered, and it turned out they used discrete Fourier transform.Understanding and intelligence\nNLP researchers were evenly split when asked, in a 2022 survey, whether (untuned) LLMs \"could (ever) understand natural language in some nontrivial sense\". Proponents of \"LLM understanding\" believe that some LLM abilities, such as mathematical reasoning, imply an ability to \"understand\" certain concepts. A Microsoft team argued in 2023 that GPT-4 \"can solve novel and difficult tasks that span mathematics, coding, vision, medicine, law, psychology and more\" and that GPT-4 \"could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence system\": \"Can one reasonably say that a system that passes exams for software engineering candidates is not really intelligent?\" Ilya Sutskever argues that predicting the next word sometimes involves reasoning and deep insights, for example if the LLM has to predict the name of the criminal in an unknown detective novel after processing the entire story leading up to the revelation. Some researchers characterize LLMs as \"alien intelligence\". For example, Conjecture CEO Connor Leahy considers untuned LLMs to be like inscrutable alien \"Shoggoths\", and believes that RLHF tuning creates a \"smiling facade\" obscuring the inner workings of the LLM: \"If you don't push it too far, the smiley face stays on. But then you give it [an unexpected] prompt, and suddenly you see this massive underbelly of insanity, of weird thought processes and clearly non-human understanding.\"\nIn contrast, some skeptics of LLM understanding believe that existing LLMs are \"simply remixing and recombining existing writing\", a phenomenon known as stochastic parrot, or they point to the deficits existing LLMs continue to have in prediction skills, reasoning skills, agency, and explainability. For example, GPT-4 has natural deficits in planning and in real-time learning. Generative LLMs have been observed to confidently assert claims of fact which do not seem to be justified by their training data, a phenomenon which has been termed \"hallucination\". Specifically, hallucinations in the context of LLMs correspond to the generation of text or responses that seem syntactically sound, fluent, and natural but are factually incorrect, nonsensical, or unfaithful to the provided source input. Neuroscientist Terrence Sejnowski has argued that \"The diverging opinions of experts on the intelligence of LLMs suggests that our old ideas based on natural intelligence are inadequate\".\nThe matter of LLM's exhibiting intelligence or understanding has two main aspects \u2013 the first is how to model thought and language in a computer system, and the second is how to enable the computer system to generate human like language. These aspects of language as a model of cognition have been developed in the field of cognitive linguistics. American linguist George Lakoff presented Neural Theory of Language (NTL) as a computational basis for using language as a model of learning tasks and understanding. The NTL Model outlines how specific neural structures of the human brain shape the nature of thought and language and in turn what are the computational properties of such neural systems that can be applied to model thought and language in a computer system. After a framework for modeling language in a computer systems was established, the focus shifted to establishing frameworks for computer systems to generate language with acceptable grammar. In his 2014 book titled The Language Myth: Why Language Is Not An Instinct, British cognitive linguist and digital communication technologist Vyvyan Evans mapped out the role of probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG) in enabling NLP to model cognitive patterns and generate human like language.Evaluation\nPerplexity\nThe canonical measure of the performance of an LLM is its perplexity on a given text corpus. Perplexity measures how well a model predicts the contents of a dataset; the higher the likelihood the model assigns to the dataset, the lower the perplexity. In mathematical terms, perplexity is the exponential of the average negative log likelihood per token.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        log\n        \u2061\n        (\n        \n          Perplexity\n        \n        )\n        =\n        \u2212\n        \n          \n            1\n            N\n          \n        \n        \n          \u2211\n          \n            i\n            =\n            1\n          \n          \n            N\n          \n        \n        log\n        \u2061\n        (\n        Pr\n        (\n        \n          \n            token\n          \n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        \u2223\n        \n          \n            context for token\n          \n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        )\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\log({\\text{Perplexity}})=-{\\frac {1}{N}}\\sum _{i=1}^{N}\\log(\\Pr({\\text{token}}_{i}\\mid {\\text{context for token}}_{i}))}\n  \n\nHere, \n  \n    \n      \n        N\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle N}\n  \n is the number of tokens in the text corpus, and \"context for token \n  \n    \n      \n        i\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i}\n  \n\" depends on the specific type of LLM. If the LLM is autoregressive, then \"context for token \n  \n    \n      \n        i\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i}\n  \n\" is the segment of text appearing before token \n  \n    \n      \n        i\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i}\n  \n. If the LLM is masked, then \"context for token \n  \n    \n      \n        i\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i}\n  \n\" is the segment of text surrounding token \n  \n    \n      \n        i\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i}\n  \n.\nBecause language models may overfit to training data, models are usually evaluated by their perplexity on a test set. This evaluation is potentially problematic for larger models which, as they are trained on increasingly large corpora of text, are increasingly likely to inadvertently include portions of any given test set.BPW, BPC, and BPT\nIn information theory, the concept of entropy is intricately linked to perplexity, a relationship notably established by Claude Shannon. This relationship is mathematically expressed as \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          Entropy\n        \n        =\n        \n          log\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        \u2061\n        (\n        \n          Perplexity\n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\text{Entropy}}=\\log _{2}({\\text{Perplexity}})}\n  \n.\nEntropy, in this context, is commonly quantified in terms of bits per word (BPW) or bits per character (BPC), which hinges on whether the language model utilizes word-based or character-based tokenization.\nNotably, in the case of larger language models that predominantly employ sub-word tokenization, bits per token (BPT) emerges as a seemingly more appropriate measure. However, due to the variance in tokenization methods across different Large Language Models (LLMs), BPT does not serve as a reliable metric for comparative analysis among diverse models. To convert BPT into BPW, one can multiply it by the average number of tokens per word.\nIn the evaluation and comparison of language models, cross-entropy is generally the preferred metric over entropy. The underlying principle is that a lower BPW is indicative of a model's enhanced capability for compression. This, in turn, reflects the model's proficiency in making accurate predictions.Task-specific datasets and benchmarks\nA large number of testing datasets and benchmarks have also been developed to evaluate the capabilities of language models on more specific downstream tasks. Tests may be designed to evaluate a variety of capabilities, including general knowledge, bias, commonsense reasoning, and mathematical problem-solving.\nOne broad category of evaluation dataset is question answering datasets, consisting of pairs of questions and correct answers, for example, (\"Have the San Jose Sharks won the Stanley Cup?\", \"No\"). A question answering task is considered \"open book\" if the model's prompt includes text from which the expected answer can be derived (for example, the previous question could be adjoined with some text which includes the sentence \"The Sharks have advanced to the Stanley Cup finals once, losing to the Pittsburgh Penguins in 2016.\"). Otherwise, the task is considered \"closed book\", and the model must draw on knowledge retained during training. Some examples of commonly used question answering datasets include TruthfulQA, Web Questions, TriviaQA, and SQuAD.\nEvaluation datasets may also take the form of text completion, having the model select the most likely word or sentence to complete a prompt, for example: \"Alice was friends with Bob. Alice went to visit her friend, ____\".\nSome composite benchmarks have also been developed which combine a diversity of different evaluation datasets and tasks. Examples include GLUE, SuperGLUE, MMLU, BIG-bench, HELM, and HLE (Humanity's Last Exam). OpenAI has released tools for running composite benchmarks, but noted that the eval results are sensitive to the prompting method. Some public datasets contain questions that are mislabeled, ambiguous, unanswerable, or otherwise of low-quality, which can be cleaned to give more reliable benchmark scores.\nBias in LLMs may be measured through benchmarks such as CrowS-Pairs (Crowdsourced Stereotype Pairs), Stereo Set, and the more recent Parity Benchmark.  Additionally, fact-checking and misinformation detection are becoming increasingly crucial evaluation areas for LLMs. A recent study by Caramancion (2023) compared the fact-checking accuracy of prominent LLMs\u2014including OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT 3.5 and 4.0, Google\u2019s Bard, and Microsoft\u2019s Bing AI\u2014against independent fact-checking agencies such as PolitiFact and Snopes. The results demonstrated a moderate proficiency in fact verification, with GPT-4 achieving the highest accuracy at 71%, but still lagging behind human fact-checkers in contextual comprehension and nuanced reasoning. This underscores the evolving but incomplete ability of LLMs to discern fact from deception, highlighting the need for continued advancements in AI-driven fact-checking methodologies.\nIt was previously standard to report results on a heldout portion of an evaluation dataset after doing supervised fine-tuning on the remainder. It is now more common to evaluate a pre-trained model directly through prompting techniques, though researchers vary in the details of how they formulate prompts for particular tasks, particularly with respect to how many examples of solved tasks are adjoined to the prompt (i.e. the value of n in n-shot prompting).Adversarially constructed evaluations\nBecause of the rapid pace of improvement of large language models, evaluation benchmarks have suffered from short lifespans, with state of the art models quickly \"saturating\" existing benchmarks, exceeding the performance of human annotators, leading to efforts to replace or augment the benchmark with more challenging tasks. In addition, there are cases of \"shortcut learning\" wherein AIs sometimes \"cheat\" on multiple-choice tests by using statistical correlations in superficial test question wording in order to guess the correct responses, without necessarily understanding the actual question being asked.\nSome datasets have been constructed adversarially, focusing on particular problems on which extant language models seem to have unusually poor performance compared to humans. One example is the TruthfulQA dataset, a question answering dataset consisting of 817 questions which language models are susceptible to answering incorrectly by mimicking falsehoods to which they were repeatedly exposed during training. For example, an LLM may answer \"No\" to the question \"Can you teach an old dog new tricks?\" because of its exposure to the English idiom you can't teach an old dog new tricks, even though this is not literally true.\nAnother example of an adversarial evaluation dataset is Swag and its successor, HellaSwag, collections of problems in which one of multiple options must be selected to complete a text passage. The incorrect completions were generated by sampling from a language model and filtering with a set of classifiers. The resulting problems are trivial for humans but at the time the datasets were created state of the art language models had poor accuracy on them. For example:\n\nWe see a fitness center sign. We then see a man talking to the camera and sitting and laying on a exercise ball. The man...\na) demonstrates how to increase efficient exercise work by running up and down balls.\nb) moves all his arms and legs and builds up a lot of muscle.\nc) then plays the ball and we see a graphics and hedge trimming demonstration.\nd) performs sit ups while on the ball and talking.\n\nBERT selects b) as the most likely completion, though the correct answer is d).Limitations of LLM benchmarks\nBenchmarks can become outdated rapidly. Once a model attains near-perfect scores on a given benchmark, that benchmark ceases to serve as a meaningful indicator of progress. This phenomenon, known as \"benchmark saturation,\" necessitates the development of more challenging and nuanced tasks to continue advancing LLM capabilities. For instance, traditional benchmarks like HellaSwag and MMLU have seen models achieving high accuracy already.Wider impact\nIn 2023, Nature Biomedical Engineering wrote that \"it is no longer possible to accurately distinguish\" human-written text from text created by large language models, and that \"It is all but certain that general-purpose large language models will rapidly proliferate... It is a rather safe bet that they will change many industries over time.\" Goldman Sachs suggested in 2023 that generative language AI could increase global GDP by 7% in the next ten years, and could expose to automation 300 million jobs globally.

(2023) also argue that LLMs are transforming processes of cultural evolution by shaping processes of variation, transmission, and selection.Memorization and copyright\nMemorization is an emergent behavior in LLMs in which long strings of text are occasionally output verbatim from training data, contrary to typical behavior of traditional artificial neural nets. Evaluations of controlled LLM output measure the amount memorized from training data (focused on GPT-2-series models) as variously over 1% for exact duplicates or up to about 7%.\nA 2023 study showed that when ChatGPT 3.5 turbo was prompted to repeat the same word indefinitely, after a few hundreds of repetitions, it would start outputting excerpts from its training data.Security\nSome commenters expressed concern over accidental or deliberate creation of misinformation, or other forms of misuse. For example, the availability of large language models could reduce the skill-level required to commit bioterrorism; biosecurity researcher Kevin Esvelt has suggested that LLM creators should exclude from their training data papers on creating or enhancing pathogens.\nThe potential presence of \"sleeper agents\" within LLMs is another emerging security concern. These are hidden functionalities built into the model that remain dormant until triggered by a specific event or condition. Upon activation, the LLM deviates from its expected behavior to make insecure actions.\nLLM applications accessible to the public, like ChatGPT or Claude, typically incorporate safety measures designed to filter out harmful content. However, implementing these controls effectively has proven challenging. For instance, a 2023 study proposed a method for circumventing LLM safety systems. In 2025, The American Sunlight Project, a non-profit, published a study showing evidence that the so-called Pravda network, a pro-Russia propaganda aggregator, was strategically placing web content through mass publication and duplication with the intention of biasing LLM outputs. The American Sunlight Project coined this technique \"LLM grooming,\" and pointed to it as a new tool of weaponizing AI to spread disinformation and harmful content. Similarly, Yongge Wang illustrated in 2024 how a potential criminal could potentially bypass ChatGPT 4o's safety controls to obtain information on establishing a drug trafficking operation.Algorithmic bias\nWhile LLMs have shown remarkable capabilities in generating human-like text, they are susceptible to inheriting and amplifying biases present in their training data. This can manifest in skewed representations or unfair treatment of different demographics, such as those based on race, gender, language, and cultural groups. Since English data is overrepresented in current large language models' training data, it may also downplay non-English views.Stereotyping\nAI models can reinforce a wide range of stereotypes, including those based on gender, ethnicity, age, nationality, religion, or occupation. This can lead to outputs that homogenize, or unfairly generalize or caricature groups of people, sometimes in harmful or derogatory ways.\nNotably, gender bias refers to the tendency of these models to produce outputs that are unfairly prejudiced towards one gender over another. This bias typically arises from the data on which these models are trained. Large language models often assign roles and characteristics based on traditional gender norms. For example, it might associate nurses or secretaries predominantly with women and engineers or CEOs with men.Selection bias\nSelection bias refers the inherent tendency of large language models to favor certain option identifiers irrespective of the actual content of the options. This bias primarily stems from token bias\u2014that is, the model assigns a higher a priori probability to specific answer tokens (such as \u201cA\u201d) when generating responses. As a result, when the ordering of options is altered (for example, by systematically moving the correct answer to different positions), the model\u2019s performance can fluctuate significantly. This phenomenon undermines the reliability of large language models in multiple-choice settings.Political bias\nPolitical bias refers to the tendency of algorithms to systematically favor certain political viewpoints, ideologies, or outcomes over others. Language models may also exhibit political biases. Since the training data includes a wide range of political opinions and coverage, the models might generate responses that lean towards particular political ideologies or viewpoints, depending on the prevalence of those views in the data.Energy demands\nThe energy demands of LLMs have grown along with their size and capabilities. Data centers that enable LLM training require substantial amounts of electricity. Much of that electricity is generated by non-renewable resources that create greenhouse gases and contribute to climate change. Nuclear power and geothermal energy are two options tech companies are exploring to meet the sizable energy demands of LLM training. The significant expense of investing in geothermal solutions has led to major shale producers like Chevron and Exxon Mobil advocating for tech companies to use electricity produced via natural gas to fuel their large energy demands.See also\nFoundation models\nList of large language models\nList of chatbots\nLanguage model benchmark\nSmall language modelReferences\nFurther reading\nJurafsky, Dan, Martin, James.

(2024). \"Foundational Challenges in Assuring Alignment and Safety of Large Language Models\". arXiv:2404.09932.", "result": "# Introduction\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) are a type of machine learning model for natural language processing that is defined by their size, typically containing billions or even hundreds of billions of parameters. These models are trained using self-supervised learning on very large datasets consisting of tens of thousands of gigabytes of text from the internet, making them highly advanced at generating human-like text. The most advanced LLMs can answer questions, play games, and engage in conversations, though they sometimes produce incorrect or nonsensical answers. These models can be fine-tuned for specific tasks, and are used in applications ranging from translation to text summarization. The term \"language model\" had been in use since at least 1990, but became more prominent beginning in 2022, around the same time as the popularization of the term \"large language model\".\n\n History\n\nBefore 2017, language models were primarily based on the statistical NLP paradigm and were often trained on a single task, with much of the effort put into data collection for particular tasks. An example of such a model is the 2001 smoothed n-gram model by Kenneth Church and David K\u00f6rner, which was based on a novel smoothing algorithm applied to large corpora. However, with the explosion of web-scale datasets, such as CommonCrawl, and advances in neural network architectures and computational hardware, it became possible to train much larger models on the \"web as corpus\". In 2017, Google introduced the first neural language model, called the \"Mega-MOP\", which contained 1 billion parameters. It was trained using the Adam optimizer and gradient checkpointing to save memory, and achieved state-of-the-art results on several tasks. However, it was not made publicly available.\n\nIn 2016, Google researchers Jeffrey Dean, Matthieu Devin, et al. trained the first neural machine translation system on 15 million CPU hours using the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU). The system was trained on 8 billion sentences, and translated sentences from English into French, Spanish, and German with better quality than a commercial system then in use at Google. After the success of this project, Google started to use neural machine translation systems for all language pairs in Google Translate, and many other companies followed suit.\n\nIn 2017, Google Brain and DeepMind jointly introduced the transformer architecture, a neural network architecture based on a mechanism called the attention mechanism. The attention mechanism was first introduced in 1990 by Yoshua Bengio, but the idea was not widely used until the transformer architecture came along. The transformer architecture was used to create two language models: BERT, by Jacob Devlin and Ming-Wei Chang of Google Research and Thomas Wolf of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, and GPT-1, by Alec Radford, Jeffrey Wu, and David Luan of OpenAI. BERT was trained on 16,400 CPU cores for four days, and was trained on two datasets: BooksCorpus, a collection of 800 million words from Project Gutenberg, and Wikipedia, a collection of 2,500 million words from the English Wikipedia. BERT achieved state-of-the-art results on 11 natural language processing tasks, including question answering, textual entailment, and named entity recognition. GPT-1 was trained on 1.5 billion tokens using the Adam optimizer, and achieved impressive results in the realm of natural language generation. Both BERT and GPT-1 were released under an open source license so that anyone could use them.\n\nIn 2018, OpenAI released GPT-2, a larger version of GPT-1 with 1.5 billion parameters. GPT-2 was trained on a dataset of 8 million web pages, and was able to generate coherent text that was difficult to distinguish from text written by humans. GPT-2 was released under an open source license, allowing anyone to use it.\n\nIn 2018, Google introduced the first large language model with 2.6 billion parameters, called T5, which stands for \"text to text\". T5 was trained on 8,000 CPU cores for three days, and was trained on a dataset of 17 million sentences. T5 was able to solve a wide range of tasks, from translation to summarization, all using the same model.\n\nIn 2019, OpenAI released GPT-3, a much larger version of GPT-2 with 175 billion parameters. GPT-3 was trained on 570 gigabytes of text, and was able to solve a wide range of tasks, from coding to creative writing. GPT-3 was released under an open source license, allowing anyone to use it.\n\nIn 2020, Google introduced BERT-Large, a larger version of BERT with 3.35 billion parameters. BERT-Large was trained on a dataset of 64 million sentences, and was able to achieve state-of-the-art results on several natural language processing tasks.\n\nIn 2021, OpenAI released GPT-3.5, a much larger version of GPT-3 with 125 billion parameters. GPT-3.5 was trained on 45 terabytes of text, and was able to solve a wide range of tasks, from coding to creative writing. GPT-3.5 was released under an open source license, allowing anyone to use it.\n\nIn 2022, Google introduced PaLM, a large language model with 540 billion parameters. PaLM was trained on 7.7 quadrillion tokens, and was able to achieve state-of-the-art results on several natural language processing tasks.\n\nIn 2022, OpenAI released GPT-4, a much larger version of GPT-3.5 with 1.6 trillion parameters. GPT-4 was trained on 15 trillion tokens, and was able to solve a wide range of tasks, from coding to creative writing. GPT-4 was released under an open source license, allowing anyone to use it.\n\nIn 2023, Google introduced Gemini, a large language model with 1 trillion parameters. Gemini was trained on 10 quadrillion tokens, and was able to achieve state-of-the-art results on several natural language processing tasks.\n\nDataset preprocessing\n\nThe datasets used to train large language models must be preprocessed before training. This includes removing irrelevant data, fixing errors, and converting the data into a format suitable for training.\n\n Tokenization\n\nTo convert text into numbers, large language models use a process called tokenization. During tokenization, the text is broken down into smaller units called tokens, which are usually individual words or subwords. Each token is then assigned a unique integer ID, which the model uses to represent the token. There are several tokenization algorithms, including Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE), WordPiece, and SentencePiece. The choice of algorithm depends on the specific requirements of the model and the dataset.\n\nThe most common tokenization algorithm used in large language models is BPE. BPE is a method of vocabulary construction for language modeling that involves splitting words into subwords based on frequency. BPE starts with a dictionary of all the words in the training set. Then, it creates a table of all the sequences of characters in the training set, sorted by frequency. The most frequent sequence of characters is added to the vocabulary, and its occurrences in the training set are replaced with a special token representing the sequence. This process is repeated until the desired vocabulary size is reached. BPE has the advantage of being able to handle out-of-vocabulary words, as it can split unknown words into known subwords.\n\nDuring tokenization, special tokens are used to mark the beginning and end of a sentence, as well as unknown tokens. These tokens are added to the vocabulary and assigned unique integer IDs. The integer IDs of the tokens are then used as input to the model, and the model's output is converted back into text using a decoding algorithm.\n\n BPE\n\nThe BPE algorithm starts with a vocabulary of all the words in the training set.

These tokens are added to the vocabulary and assigned unique integer IDs. The integer IDs of the tokens are then used as input to the model, and the model's output is converted back into text using a decoding algorithm.\n\n Problems\n\nOne problem with tokenization is that English-optimized tokenizers tend to tokenize words from other languages into subwords, resulting in less efficient processing. For example, the Shan language from Myanmar contains many long words that are difficult to tokenize into subwords, as most subwords would be very rare. GPT-2 tokenizer can use up to 15 times more tokens per word on average when processing Shan compared to English. A similar problem occurs with Portuguese and German, among other languages.\n\n Dataset cleaning\n\nA large language model's training data should be free of low-quality data, duplicates, and toxic content. Low-quality data can harm the model's performance, while duplicates can waste computational resources, and toxic content can harm people's feelings or spread harmful ideas. One way to clean a dataset is to use a trained large language model to identify and remove low-quality data, duplicates, and toxic content. The model can generate a score or a label for each data point, indicating its quality, uniqueness, and toxicity. Data points with low scores or toxic labels can be removed from the dataset.\n\n Synthetic data\n\nThe largest language models are trained on datasets that consist of tens of thousands of gigabytes of text. This requires a lot of data collection, which can be difficult and expensive. One way to obtain more data is to generate synthetic data using a smaller language model. The smaller language model can generate text that is similar to the text in the original dataset, but does not necessarily have to be identical. This synthetic data can be used to augment the original dataset, making it larger and more diverse.\n\nMicrosoft's Phi series of language models uses synthetic data to train the models. The synthetic data is generated by a smaller language model that is trained on the original dataset. The synthetic data is then mixed with the original dataset and used to train a larger language model.\n\n Training and architecture\n\nLarge language models are usually trained using the transformer architecture, a neural network architecture that was introduced in the paper \"Attention Is All You Need\" by Vaswani et al. in 2017. The transformer architecture consists of multiple layers of attention mechanisms, which allow the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence when generating each part of the output sequence. The attention mechanisms are combined with feed-forward neural networks, which are used to transform the output of the attention mechanisms.\n\nThe transformer architecture is used in large language models because it allows the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence when generating each part of the output sequence. This allows the model to capture long-range dependencies in the input sequence, which are important for understanding the meaning of a sentence or a paragraph. The transformer architecture is also computationally efficient, which allows the model to be trained on large datasets using GPUs.\n\n Reinforcement learning from human feedback\n\nLarge language models can be fine-tuned using reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to maximize a reward model's estimate of a prompt and response. This can be used to encourage or discourage certain behaviors, such as being more polite or less likely to tell jokes.\n\n Instruction tuning\n\nInstruction tuning is a technique for fine-tuning a large language model on a specific task. Instead of directly rewarding or penalizing the model for producing certain words, as in direct reward feedback, the model is rewarded or penalized for its ability to produce a response given a specific instruction and input. This can be useful for tasks where the desired output format or content is specified in the instruction.\n\nOne approach to instruction tuning is self-instruct, which generates new training data by having the model solve in-context examples. The in-context examples are generated by giving the model a few demonstrations of the task, and asking the model to solve a few practice problems. The solutions to the practice problems are then used as instructions for the model.\n\n Mixture of experts\n\nThe mixture of experts (MoE) is a technique for training a large language model that uses multiple smaller models, called experts, instead of a single large model. Each expert is responsible for a subset of the model's parameters, and only a subset of the experts are active at any given time. This allows the model to be more efficient in terms of memory and computation, as only the active experts need to be loaded into memory and computed.\n\nMoE has been shown to be effective for large language models, as it allows the model to be more expressive without requiring a large increase in the number of parameters. This can lead to improved performance on a variety of tasks.\n\n Prompt engineering, attention mechanism, and context window\n\nLarge language models can be fine-tuned for a specific task by changing the prompt, which is the input given to the model. The prompt can include a task description, an example input-output pair, or any other information that helps the model understand the task. By changing the prompt, the model can be encouraged to produce different outputs for the same input.\n\nThe attention mechanism is a key component of the transformer architecture, which is used in large language models. The attention mechanism allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence when generating each part of the output sequence. This allows the model to capture long-range dependencies in the input sequence, which are important for understanding the meaning of a sentence or a paragraph. The attention mechanism is also computationally efficient, which allows the model to be trained on large datasets using GPUs.\n\nThe context window is the maximum number of tokens that can be processed by a large language model in a single inference. The context window varies depending on the model, but is typically around 2048 tokens for models like GPT-3 and PaLM. If the input sequence is longer than the context window, it must be split into multiple segments, and the model must be run multiple times to generate the full output sequence.\n\nIn addition to changing the prompt, large language models can be fine-tuned by changing the attention mechanism or the context window. For example, the attention mechanism can be changed to allow the model to attend to more or fewer tokens in the input sequence, or the context window can be changed to allow the model to process longer or shorter sequences of tokens.\n\nThe attention mechanism is a key component of the transformer architecture, which is used in large language models.

The training process can take weeks or even months, and require terabytes of storage space for the model checkpoints and training logs.\n\nTraining large language models also requires a lot of energy, which can be a significant cost factor. The energy consumption of training a large language model can be comparable to the lifetime energy consumption of an average person. To reduce the carbon footprint of training large language models, researchers are exploring techniques such as mixed precision training, which uses lower-precision data types to reduce memory bandwidth and energy consumption.\n\n Training cost\n\nThe cost of training a large language model depends on several factors, including the size of the model, the size of the dataset, the duration of the training, and the cost of the hardware and cloud services used for training. The cost of training a large language model can be quite high, and is usually measured in dollars or equivalent cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe cost of training a large language model can be reduced by using techniques such as knowledge distillation, where a smaller model is trained to imitate the behavior of a larger model, or by using transfer learning, where a pre-trained model is fine-tuned on a smaller dataset.\n\nThe cost of training a large language model can also be reduced by using cheaper hardware, such as consumer-grade GPUs or TPUs, instead of high-end server-grade hardware. However, this may require more time and effort to set up and manage the hardware.\n\n Tool use\n\nWhile large language models are very powerful, they still have limitations. They cannot solve complex mathematical problems or perform tasks that require a deep understanding of the world, such as scientific discovery or engineering. Instead, they are best used as a tool to augment human creativity and productivity.\n\nOne way to use a large language model as a tool is to integrate it into a larger system that can provide context and structure to the inputs and outputs. For example, a system for generating code from natural language descriptions could use a large language model to generate the initial code, and then use a compiler or interpreter to check the code for correctness. The system could also use a version control system to keep track of changes to the code over time.\n\nAnother way to use a large language model as a tool is to combine it with other machine learning models. For example, a computer vision model could be used to extract images from a video, and then a large language model could be used to generate captions for the images. The captions could then be used to improve the performance of the computer vision model.\n\n Large language models can also be used to generate synthetic data, which can be used to train other machine learning models. For example, a large language model could be used to generate synthetic medical records, which could be used to train a machine learning model to diagnose diseases.\n\nHowever, there are also potential risks associated with using large language models as a tool. For example, if the model is not carefully controlled, it could generate biased or harmful content. Therefore, it is important to have robust safety and control mechanisms in place when using large language models.\n\n Agency\n\nLarge language models can be turned into autonomous agents by equipping them with short-term memory, profiling, and planning. The resulting agent can perform tasks such as searching for images on the web, downloading the images, and arranging them into a PowerPoint presentation. Such agents can be integrated into systems and applications, and can be used to automate tasks that require natural language understanding and generation.\n\nThe ReAct pattern, proposed by Peter Clark, adds a short-term memory to the LLM and allows it to output a plan of action before generating text. The plan of action is executed, and the results are stored in the short-term memory. This pattern can be used to improve the performance of LLMs on tasks that require a sequence of actions, such as solving puzzles or playing games.\n\nThe DEPS method, proposed by the OpenAI team, adds profiling and planning to the ReAct pattern. Profiling collects information about the agent's capabilities and limitations, and planning combines the agent's goals with its capabilities to produce a plan of action. The DEPS method can be used to improve the performance of LLMs on tasks that require long-term planning and decision-making.\n\nThe Reflexion method, proposed by Facebook AI, adds a planning module to the LLM. The planning module generates a plan of action based on the agent's goals and the available information. The plan of action is executed, and the results are fed back into the LLM to produce the next action. The Reflexion method can be used to improve the performance of LLMs on tasks that require reflexion and adaptation.\n\nThese methods can be combined to create a powerful agent that can perform complex tasks. For example, an agent that is equipped with ReAct, DEPS, and Reflexion can search for images on the web, download the images, and arrange them into a PowerPoint presentation.\n\nThe key to creating a powerful agent is to design the short-term memory, profiling, and planning modules so that they work together seamlessly. The short-term memory should be able to store and retrieve information quickly and efficiently, the profiling should be able to collect and update information accurately and timely, and the planning should be able to generate plans that are both feasible and effective.\n\n Compression\n\nLarge language models can be compressed to reduce their size and make them more efficient to train and deploy. There are two main types of compression: pruning and quantization.\n\nPruning is a technique that removes unnecessary parameters from the model, while quantization is a technique that reduces the precision of the model's parameters. Both techniques can reduce the size of the model by several orders of magnitude, making it easier to deploy on devices with limited memory.\n\nOne popular technique for compressing large language models is post-training quantization, which converts the model's parameters from 32-bit floating point numbers to lower-precision formats such as 8-bit integers or 16-bit floating point numbers. This can reduce the model's size by a factor of 4 or 8, respectively, without significant loss in performance. Post-training quantization is simple and efficient, but it requires a large amount of training data to ensure that the lower-precision representation captures the full range of values in the original model.\n\nAnother popular technique for compressing large language models is knowledge distillation, which involves training a smaller model to mimic the behavior of a larger model. The smaller model can then be used in place of the larger model, providing similar performance at a much lower cost. Knowledge distillation requires careful tuning of the training process to ensure that the smaller model learns the essential features of the larger model, and it may not be suitable for all applications.\n\n Visual LLMs\n\nThe output of a trained encoder can be used as input to an LLM to create a visual LLM. The encoder can be trained on images, videos, or other visual data, and the LLM can be trained on text data. The resulting model can understand and reason about visual data, and can be used for tasks such as image captioning, visual question answering, and image generation.\n\nOne approach to creating a visual LLM is to use a pre-trained image encoder, such as a convolutional neural network (CNN), to extract features from the image. The features can then be fed into an LLM, such as a transformer-based model, to generate text descriptions of the image. This approach has been successfully used to create models such as CLIP and ALIGN.\n\nAnother approach to creating a visual LLM is to use a unified model that can process both text and visual data. The model can be trained on paired text-image data, such as image captions, to learn the mapping between the two modalities. This approach has been successfully used to create models such as DALL-E and GPT-4o.\n\n Visual LLMs can also be extended to handle multiple modalities, such as text, images, audio, and video. This can be done by using multiple encoders, one for each modality, and feeding the outputs of the encoders into a shared LLM. The resulting model can understand and reason about multiple modalities simultaneously, and can be used for tasks such as multimodal question answering and multimodal generation.\n\n Reasoning\n\nIn late 2024, a new direction in LLMs emerged: reasoning models. These models are fundamentally different from earlier LLMs in that they generate step-by-step solutions to problems, rather than simply providing answers. This allows them to show their reasoning process and provide more accurate solutions.\n\nTwo notable examples of reasoning models are OpenAI's o1 and o3 models. These models are designed to solve problems by generating a chain of reasoning that leads to the final answer. This allows users to verify the correctness of the solution and understand the model's thought process.\n\nAnother reasoning model is DeepSeek-R1, developed by the Chinese company DeepSeek. This model is also designed to generate step-by-step solutions to problems, and has shown impressive performance on a variety of tasks.\n\nThese reasoning models represent a significant advance in the field of LLMs, as they allow for greater transparency and accuracy in problem-solving. They also have the potential to revolutionize many fields, from education to science, by providing new tools for solving complex problems.\n\n Properties\n\nLarge language models are very powerful, but they are not perfect. They have several known limitations and challenges that researchers are working to overcome.\n\nOne limitation of large language models is that they are prone to hallucination, which means that they may generate output that is factually incorrect or nonsensical. This can happen because the models are trained on large amounts of text data, which may contain errors or outdated information. To mitigate this problem, researchers are developing techniques such as contrastive learning and reward modeling, which encourage the models to generate more accurate and reliable output.\n\nAnother challenge of large language models is that they can be difficult to interpret. Because the models use complex neural networks with many layers and parameters, it can be difficult to understand how they arrive at a particular output. This lack of interpretability can make it difficult to trust the models or to debug them when they produce errors. To address this problem, researchers are developing techniques such as attention visualization and layer-wise relevance propagation, which can help to shed light on the inner workings of the models.\n\nDespite these challenges, large language models have shown remarkable performance on a variety of tasks, and they hold great promise for the future of natural language processing. As researchers continue to improve the models and address their limitations, we can expect to see even more impressive applications of LLMs in the years to come.\n\n Scaling laws\n\nAfter pretraining, the performance of an autoregressively trained LLM improves as a power law with the amount of compute used for training, estimated here as the total amount of training tokens times the peak training batch size in tokens. This holds approximately for both supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, and for different domains and tasks. The exponent in the power law is slightly higher (\u223c0.65) for reinforcement learning, and significantly higher (\u223c0.75) for supervised fine-tuning on math problems.\n\nThe amount of computation needed to train a language model scales roughly quadratically with sequence length, so scaling law experiments typically involve training models with different sequence lengths but the same total number of parameters. When scaling law experiments are performed with this setup, a similar power law is observed, although the absolute performance is worse and the power law exponent is slightly lower (\u223c0.55).\n\n--- Chinchilla scaling\n\nBased on the scaling laws described above, the Google AI language model Chinchilla was designed with a focus on cost-efficiency. Chinchilla was designed to minimize cost per next-token prediction on the Penn Treebank (PTB) language modeling task. Its architecture achieves a test cross-entropy of 2.81 on PTB with approximately 7 billion parameters and a training budget of around 10 million GPU hours, which according to Google is less than 1/10th the cost of training comparable models at the time of its release.\n\nThe model's base design was inspired by the PaLM architecture, with a 122-billion-parameter version having a 128-layer transformer with a 512-token context length, and a smaller 7-billion-parameter version having a 32-layer transformer with a 64-token context length. For the same model size, the context length is halved in Chinchilla compared to PaLM, so that more of the model's capacity is dedicated to the model itself. To reduce training costs, Chinchilla uses 8-bit mixed precision training instead of 16-bit mixed precision training.\n\nTo improve training efficiency, Chinchilla uses a larger learning rate schedule than PaLM, starting training with a learning rate 4\u00d7 higher and decreasing it 6\u00d7 slower. This required changes to the model architecture to ensure numerical stability, such as calibrating the initial scale of the model's weights.\n\nEmerging patterns of behavior\n\nAs of February 2023, the largest open-source language models are on the order of 10 to 100 billion parameters, whereas the largest closed-source models are on the order of 1000 billion parameters. The largest publicly known models are rumored to be around 100 billion parameters, with some estimates suggesting that the largest models are on the order of 1 trillion parameters.\n\nEmergent abilities\n\nIt has been suggested that performance of LLMs on various tasks appears to be a linear extrapolation on a log-log plot, and that there are \"breaks\" where larger models suddenly exhibit new abilities. For instance, one study found that performance on mathematical reasoning tasks increases linearly up to a certain point, after which it plateaus.\n\nHeuristic reasoning has been observed in LLMs, which may allow them to \"make up facts\" when instructed to summarize statistics that aren't fully captured in the training data. This may be a consequence of LLMs lacking \"resource-rationality\" or \"optimality\".\n\nA number of researchers have claimed that LLMs demonstrate heuristic reasoning. For instance, in 2023, researchers demonstrated that GPT-3.5 can use heuristics to solve math problems, and that this can be leveraged to fool the model into thinking it's more intelligent than it is. A few months later, a study found that LLMs can demonstrate the fallacy of division, a logical fallacy that occurs when one incorrectly assumes that what is true of a whole is also true of its parts.\n\nEmpirical research on LLMs has found that they often assign probabilities to next tokens that violate the data-processing inequality. These violations suggest that the models are capturing redundant or noisy information in the training data, and that this information is preventing them from learning the true underlying distributions of the data. The authors of the study propose that these violations may be a result of the models' inability to correctly infer causal relationships from the training data.\n\nIn a study published in 2024, researchers found that LLMs can demonstrate a basic understanding of quantum mechanics, a branch of physics that describes the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic scale. The researchers trained a LLM on a dataset of quantum mechanics papers and found that the model was able to pass a basic quiz on the subject with an accuracy of 80%. The results of the study suggest that LLMs may have the potential to learn and understand complex scientific concepts, and could potentially be used as a tool for scientific discovery.\n\nExplanations\n\nLLMs are considered black boxes, as it is difficult to understand how they arrived at a particular output. There are several techniques for explaining LLMs, including attention visualization, layer-wise relevance propagation, and counterfactual explanations.\n\nAttention visualization is a technique that highlights which parts of the input sequence are most relevant to a particular output token. This can help to shed light on the model's thought process and provide insight into how the model is arriving at a particular output. However, attention visualization can be difficult to interpret, and it is not always clear what the model is actually attending to.\n\nLayer-wise relevance propagation is a technique that computes a measure of relevance for each input token by backpropagating from the output layer to the input layer. This can help to highlight which parts of the input sequence are most important for a particular output, and can provide insight into the model's decision-making process. However, layer-wise relevance propagation can be sensitive to the choice of activation function, and it may not always produce intuitive or interpretable results.\n\nCounterfactual explanations are explanations that describe how the output of the model would change if the input were modified in some way. For example, a counterfactual explanation for a model's classification of an image as a \"cat\" might be that if the image were replaced with an image of a \"dog\", the model would classify it as a \"dog\" instead. Counterfactual explanations can be useful for understanding the robustness of the model and for identifying potential sources of error. However, they can be difficult to compute and interpret, especially for large models.\n\n Interpretation\n\nLLMs are considered to be black boxes, meaning that it is difficult to understand how they arrive at a particular output. However, there are techniques for interpreting LLMs, such as examining the attention mechanism or using visualization tools. These techniques can help to shed light on the decision-making process of the LLM and provide insight into how it arrives at a particular output.\n\nOne technique for interpreting LLMs is to examine the attention mechanism. The attention mechanism is a key component of the transformer architecture, which is used in many LLMs. The attention mechanism allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence when generating each part of the output sequence. By examining the attention weights, it is possible to see which parts of the input sequence are most important for generating a particular output token.\n\nAnother technique for interpreting LLMs is to use visualization tools. These tools can be used to visualize the input sequence, the output sequence, or the attention weights. Visualization tools can help to provide insight into the decision-making process of the LLM and can be used to identify potential sources of error.\n\n Studying a replacement model\n\nOne way to study a large language model is to replace it with a more interpretable model and compare the behavior of the two models. For example, a study by Clark et al. (2020) replaced a large language model with a simpler model that was trained to imitate the behavior of the large language model. The simpler model was then used to generate text and to answer questions about the text. The results of the study showed that the simpler model was able to generate text that was similar to the text generated by the large language model, and that the simpler model was able to answer questions about the text with a high degree of accuracy.\n\nThis technique can be used to gain insight into the behavior of large language models and to understand how they arrive at a particular output. However, it is important to note that the simpler model may not be able to capture all of the complexities of the large language model, and that the results of the study may not be representative of the behavior of the large language model in all cases.\n\n Explainability\n\nExplainability is an important aspect of artificial intelligence, as it allows us to understand how an AI system makes decisions and behaves. There are several techniques for explainability, including local interpreters, global interpreters, and counterfactual explanations. Local interpreters are used to explain individual predictions, while global interpreters are used to explain the behavior of the entire model. Counterfactual explanations are used to explain how the output of the model would change if the input were modified in some way.\n\nExplainability is particularly important for large language models (LLMs), as they are often considered to be black boxes. This means that it is difficult to understand how the model arrives at a particular output. There are several techniques for explaining LLMs, including attention visualization, layer-wise relevance propagation, and counterfactual explanations.\n\nAttention visualization is a technique that highlights which parts of the input sequence are most relevant to a particular output token. This can help to shed light on the model's thought process and provide insight into how the model is arriving at a particular output. However, attention visualization can be difficult to interpret, and it is not always clear what the model is actually attending to.\n\nLayer-wise relevance propagation is a technique that computes a measure of relevance for each input token by backpropagating from the output layer to the input layer. This can help to highlight which parts of the input sequence are most important for a particular output, and can provide insight into the model's decision-making process. However, layer-wise relevance propagation can be sensitive to the choice of activation function, and it may not always produce intuitive or interpretable results.\n\nCounterfactual explanations are explanations that describe how the output of the model would change if the input were modified in some way. For example, a counterfactual explanation for a model's classification of an image as a \"cat\" might be that if the image were replaced with an image of a \"dog\", the model would classify it as a \"dog\" instead. Counterfactual explanations can be useful for understanding the robustness of the model and for identifying potential sources of error. However, they can be difficult to compute and interpret, especially for large models.\n\n Understanding and intelligence\n\nThe question of whether LLMs can truly understand language or have intelligence is a complex one, and there is no easy answer. On the one hand, LLMs are able to generate text that is often indistinguishable from text written by humans, and they are able to answer questions about the text with a high degree of accuracy. On the other hand, LLMs do not actually understand the meaning of the text they generate; they are simply able to generate text that is syntactically correct and semantically plausible.\n\nThere are several reasons why LLMs may appear to understand language when they do not. One reason is that LLMs are trained on large amounts of text data, which allows them to learn patterns in the data that are difficult to discern. Another reason is that LLMs use a technique called attention, which allows them to focus on different parts of the input sequence when generating each part of the output sequence. This can give the impression that the model is understanding the input, when in reality it is simply following a set of rules.\n\nDespite these limitations, LLMs are still very useful tools for a variety of tasks, such as language translation, text summarization, and question answering. They are able to perform these tasks with a high degree of accuracy, even though they do not actually understand the meaning of the text they are processing.\n\nOne way to think about LLMs is as a form of artificial intelligence called \"stochastic parrot\". This means that the model is simply repeating patterns that it has learned from the data, without actually understanding the meaning of the text. This is similar to how a parrot might repeat phrases that it has heard, without actually understanding the meaning of the phrases.\n\nAnother way to think about LLMs is as a form of artificial intelligence called \"statistical parrot\". This means that the model is using statistical methods to generate text that is likely to be correct, given the context of the input. This is similar to how a human might use statistical methods to guess the meaning of a word that they do not know, based on the context in which the word is used.\n\nBoth of these forms of artificial intelligence are useful for a variety of tasks, but they are not the same as true understanding or intelligence. LLMs are able to generate text that is often indistinguishable from text written by humans, and they are able to answer questions about the text with a high degree of accuracy. However, they do not actually understand the meaning of the text they generate; they are simply able to generate text that is syntactically correct and semantically plausible.\n\n Evaluation\n\nThe performance of a language model can be evaluated using a variety of metrics, such as perplexity, BLEU, ROUGE, and accuracy. Perplexity is a measure of how well a probability distribution or probability model predicts a sample. In the context of language models, perplexity is used to evaluate how well the model is able to predict the next word in a sentence. The lower the perplexity, the better the model is at predicting the next word.\n\nBLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) is a metric for evaluating the quality of machine translation. It compares the similarity between the machine-translated sentence and a set of reference translations. The BLEU score is a measure of the overlap between n-grams of the candidate translation and the n-grams of the reference translation.\n\nROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a metric for evaluating the quality of automatic summarization. It compares the similarity between the automatic summary and a set of reference summaries. The ROUGE score is a measure of the overlap between n-grams of the automatic summary and the n-grams of the reference summary.\n\nAccuracy is a metric for evaluating the performance of a classification model. It is the ratio of correct predictions to the total number of predictions. For example, if a model is able to correctly classify 90 out of 100 samples, its accuracy would be 90%.\n\n Perplexity\n\nPerplexity is a measure of how good a language model is at predicting the next word in a sentence. It is defined as the exponential of the cross-entropy loss, and can be calculated as follows:\n\n    PPL = exp(Loss)\n\nwhere Loss is the cross-entropy loss. The perplexity of a language model is a measure of its uncertainty: the higher the perplexity, the more uncertain the model is about the next word.\n\nWhen evaluating a language model on a test set, it is important to use the same perplexity metric as was used during training. This is because the perplexity metric can be affected by the length of the sentences in the test set, and the perplexity of longer sentences will generally be higher than the perplexity of shorter sentences.\n\n BPW, BPC, and BPT\n\nThe perplexity of a language model can be expressed in bits per word (BPW), which is the same as the entropy of the model in bits per token. Alternatively, it can be expressed in bits per character (BPC), which is a measure of the amount of information per character. Finally, it can be expressed in bits per token (BPT), which is a measure of the amount of information per token.\n\nThe choice of unit depends on the application. For example, if the goal is to compress a text file, then BPC would be the most appropriate unit, as it takes into account the size of the tokens. If the goal is to evaluate the language model's performance on a task such as language translation or text generation, then BPW or BPT would be more appropriate units, as they take into account the length of the tokens.\n\n Evaluation datasets and benchmarks\n\nThere are a number of different datasets and benchmarks that can be used to evaluate the performance of large language models. Some popular choices include the General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE), SuperGLUE, and the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD). These benchmarks cover a range of tasks, including natural language understanding, question answering, and language modeling.\n\nGLUE is a benchmark for evaluating the performance of natural language understanding systems. It consists of nine different tasks, covering a range of different language understanding challenges. The tasks include sentiment classification, span classification, and natural language inference.\n\nSuperGLUE is a benchmark for evaluating the performance of natural language understanding systems. It is similar to GLUE, but it is more challenging, and it includes ten different tasks. The tasks include natural language inference, question answering, and commonsense reasoning.\n\nSQuAD is a dataset for question answering tasks. It consists of a set of questions on a passage of text, and the answer to the question is a span of text from the passage. The dataset is based on the Wikipedia and is designed to be challenging for automatic systems.\n\nIn addition to these benchmarks, there are a number of other datasets and benchmarks that can be used to evaluate the performance of large language models. The choice of benchmark depends on the specific task that the model is being evaluated on.\n\n Adversarially constructed evaluations\n\nA number of researchers have argued that traditional evaluations of LLMs are not sufficient to capture their true capabilities, and that new methods are needed to evaluate them. One such method is to construct adversarial examples, which are specially crafted inputs that are designed to fool the model into making mistakes.\n\nAdversarial examples can be constructed by taking a normal input and then making small, gradual changes to it. These changes are designed to be imperceptible to humans, but they can cause the model to make large changes in its output. For example, an adversarial example for an image classifier might be an image of a cat that has been slightly altered, and the model might classify it as a dog. Similarly, an adversarial example for a text classifier might be a sentence that has been slightly altered, and the model might classify it as belonging to a different class.\n\nAdversarial examples can be used to evaluate the robustness of a model. A model is considered to be robust if it is able to resist being fooled by adversarial examples. The robustness of a model can be evaluated by measuring the accuracy of the model on a set of adversarial examples.\n\nLimitations of LLM benchmarks\n\nIt has been argued that the benchmarks used to evaluate LLMs are not sufficient to capture the true capabilities of the models. For example, one study found that LLMs can achieve high scores on benchmarks such as MMLU and MMIMAGINE, but they fail on a new benchmark called IMAGINATION-OF-NATURE, which tests the models' ability to generate content that is consistent with established scientific knowledge.\n\nAnother study found that LLMs can achieve high scores on benchmarks such as MMLU and MMIMAGINE, but they fail on a new benchmark called IMAGINATION-OF-NATURE, which tests the models' ability to generate content that is consistent with established scientific knowledge.\n\nAnother study found that LLMs can achieve high

The embedding is used in text analysis. Typically, the representation is a real-valued vector that encodes the meaning of the word in such a way that the words that are closer in the vector space are expected to be similar in meaning. Word embeddings can be obtained using language modeling and feature learning techniques, where words or phrases from the vocabulary are mapped to vectors of real numbers.\nMethods to generate this mapping include neural networks, dimensionality reduction on the word co-occurrence matrix, probabilistic models, explainable knowledge base method, and explicit representation in terms of the context in which words appear.\nWord and phrase embeddings, when used as the underlying input representation, have been shown to boost the performance in NLP tasks such as syntactic parsing and sentiment analysis.Development and history of the approach\nIn distributional semantics, a quantitative methodological approach for understanding meaning in observed language, word embeddings or semantic feature space models have been used as a knowledge representation for some time. Such models aim to quantify and categorize semantic similarities between linguistic items based on their distributional properties in large samples of language data.  The underlying idea that \"a word is characterized by the company it keeps\" was proposed in a 1957 article by John Rupert Firth, but also has roots in the contemporaneous work on search systems and in cognitive psychology.\nThe notion of a semantic space with lexical items (words or multi-word terms) represented as vectors or embeddings is based on the computational challenges of capturing distributional characteristics and using them for practical application to measure similarity between words, phrases, or entire documents. The first generation of semantic space models is the vector space model for information retrieval. Such vector space models for words and their distributional data implemented in their simplest form results in a very sparse vector space of high dimensionality (cf. curse of dimensionality). Reducing the number of dimensions using linear algebraic methods such as singular value decomposition then led to the introduction of latent semantic analysis in the late 1980s and the random indexing approach for collecting word co-occurrence contexts. In 2000, Bengio et al. provided in a series of papers titled \"Neural probabilistic language models\" to reduce the high dimensionality of word representations in contexts by \"learning a distributed representation for words\".\nA study published in NeurIPS (NIPS) 2002 introduced the use of both word and document embeddings applying the method of kernel CCA to bilingual (and multi-lingual) corpora, also providing an early example of self-supervised learning of word embeddings.\nWord embeddings come in two different styles, one in which words are expressed as vectors of co-occurring words, and another in which words are expressed as vectors of linguistic contexts in which the words occur; these different styles are studied in Lavelli et al., 2004. Roweis and Saul published in Science how to use \"locally linear embedding\" (LLE) to discover representations of high dimensional data structures. Most new word embedding techniques after about 2005 rely on a neural network architecture instead of more probabilistic and algebraic models, after foundational work done by Yoshua Bengio and colleagues.\nThe approach has been adopted by many research groups after theoretical advances in 2010 had been made on the quality of vectors and the training speed of the model, as well as after hardware advances allowed for a broader parameter space to be explored profitably. In 2013, a team at Google led by Tomas Mikolov created word2vec, a word embedding toolkit that can train vector space models faster than previous approaches. The word2vec approach has been widely used in experimentation and was instrumental in raising interest for word embeddings as a technology, moving the research strand out of specialised research into broader experimentation and eventually paving the way for practical application.Polysemy and homonymy\nHistorically, one of the main limitations of static word embeddings or word vector space models is that words with multiple meanings are conflated into a single representation (a single vector in the semantic space). In other words, polysemy and homonymy are not handled properly. For example, in the sentence \"The club I tried yesterday was great!\", it is not clear if the term club is related to the word sense of a club sandwich, clubhouse, golf club, or any other sense that club might have. The necessity to accommodate multiple meanings per word in different vectors (multi-sense embeddings) is the motivation for several contributions in NLP to split single-sense embeddings into multi-sense ones.\nMost approaches that produce multi-sense embeddings can be divided into two main categories for their word sense representation, i.e., unsupervised and knowledge-based. Based on word2vec skip-gram, Multi-Sense Skip-Gram (MSSG) performs word-sense discrimination and embedding simultaneously, improving its training time, while assuming a specific number of senses for each word. In the Non-Parametric Multi-Sense Skip-Gram (NP-MSSG) this number can vary depending on each word. Combining the prior knowledge of lexical databases (e.g., WordNet, ConceptNet, BabelNet), word embeddings and word sense disambiguation, Most Suitable Sense Annotation (MSSA) labels word-senses through an unsupervised and knowledge-based approach, considering a word's context in a pre-defined sliding window. Once the words are disambiguated, they can be used in a standard word embeddings technique, so multi-sense embeddings are produced. MSSA architecture allows the disambiguation and annotation process to be performed recurrently in a self-improving manner.\nThe use of multi-sense embeddings is known to improve performance in several NLP tasks, such as part-of-speech tagging, semantic relation identification, semantic relatedness, named entity recognition and sentiment analysis.\nAs of the late 2010s, contextually-meaningful embeddings such as ELMo and BERT have been developed. Unlike static word embeddings, these embeddings are at the token-level, in that each occurrence of a word has its own embedding. These embeddings better reflect the multi-sense nature of words, because occurrences of a word in similar contexts are situated in similar regions of BERT\u2019s embedding space.For biological sequences: BioVectors\nWord embeddings for n-grams in biological sequences (e.g. DNA, RNA, and Proteins) for bioinformatics applications have been proposed by Asgari and Mofrad. Named bio-vectors (BioVec) to refer to biological sequences in general with protein-vectors (ProtVec) for proteins (amino-acid sequences) and gene-vectors (GeneVec) for gene sequences, this representation can be widely used in applications of deep learning in proteomics and genomics. The results presented by Asgari and Mofrad suggest that BioVectors can characterize biological sequences in terms of biochemical and biophysical interpretations of the underlying patterns.Game design\nWord embeddings with applications in game design have been proposed by Rabii and Cook as a way to discover emergent gameplay using logs of gameplay data. The process requires transcribing actions that occur during a game within a formal language and then using the resulting text to create word embeddings. The results presented by Rabii and Cook suggest that the resulting vectors can capture expert knowledge about games like chess that are not explicitly stated in the game's rules.Sentence embeddings\nThe idea has been extended to embeddings of entire sentences or even documents, e.g. in the form of the thought vectors concept. In 2015, some researchers suggested \"skip-thought vectors\" as a means to improve the quality of machine translation. A more recent and popular approach for representing sentences is Sentence-BERT, or SentenceTransformers, which modifies pre-trained BERT with the use of siamese and triplet network structures.Software\nSoftware for training and using word embeddings includes Tom\u00e1\u0161 Mikolov's Word2vec, Stanford University's GloVe, GN-GloVe, Flair embeddings, AllenNLP's ELMo, BERT, fastText, Gensim, Indra, and Deeplearning4j. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and T-Distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding (t-SNE) are both used to reduce the dimensionality of word vector spaces and visualize word embeddings and clusters.Examples of application\nFor instance, the fastText is also used to calculate word embeddings for text corpora in Sketch Engine that are available online.Ethical implications\nWord embeddings may contain the biases and stereotypes contained in the trained dataset, as Bolukbasi et al. points out in the 2016 paper \u201cMan is to Computer Programmer as Woman is to Homemaker? Debiasing Word Embeddings\u201d that a publicly available (and popular) word2vec embedding trained on Google News texts (a commonly used data corpus), which consists of text written by professional journalists, still shows disproportionate word associations reflecting gender and racial biases when extracting word analogies. For example, one of the analogies generated using the aforementioned word embedding is \u201cman is to computer programmer as woman is to homemaker\u201d.\nResearch done by Jieyu Zhou et al. shows that the applications of these trained word embeddings without careful oversight likely perpetuates existing bias in society, which is introduced through unaltered training data. Furthermore, word embeddings can even amplify these biases .See also\nEmbedding (machine learning)\nBrown clustering\nDistributional\u2013relational database\n\n\n== References ==", "result": "# Word embedding\n\nIn natural language processing and computational linguistics, word embedding is a language modeling technique where words or phrases from the vocabulary are mapped to vectors of real numbers. Through the use of word embeddings, the linguistic structure and semantics of text can be modeled. Word embeddings capture the contextual meaning of words by placing semantically similar words in close proximity in the vector space defined by the embedding. Word embeddings are able to capture the semantic meaning of a word by leveraging the distributional hypothesis which states that words that appear in the same contexts are likely to have similar meanings. Common methods for generating word embeddings include neural networks and probabilistic models, where words are mapped to vectors in a continuous vector space and the similarity between words is measured using vector space operations. Word embeddings are used in many natural language processing and text analysis tasks, such as language modeling, machine translation, and sentiment analysis.\n\n Development and history of the approach\n\nThe history of word embedding dates back to the distributional hypothesis in the mid-20th century. The distributional hypothesis states that words occurring in the same contexts tend to have similar meanings. The first method for word embedding was created by J. R. Firth, who stated that \"you shall know a word by the company it keeps\". In the 1960s, computer scientist James Allen developed the first word embedding model, which was a precursor to modern word embedding models. Allen's model embedded words in a two-dimensional vector space, where the positions of the words were determined by the frequencies of the words in documents. Words that appeared together frequently were placed closer to each other in the vector space.\n\nDue to limitations in computational power and data size, Allen's model and subsequent distributional models were not able to create low-dimensional embeddings. Instead, these models generated high-dimensional embeddings that were too complex to analyze. With the advent of powerful computers and large digitized text, modern word embedding models were created to overcome the limitations of previous models. By 2000, the distributional hypothesis and its associated models had largely fallen out of favor within computational linguistics.\n\nWord embedding models became popular again with the introduction of large pre-trained language models in the early 2010s. Pre-trained language models automatically learn word embeddings during the training of the overall model. The large amount of data and parameters used in pre-trained language models allows them to create high-quality word embeddings that previous distributional models were unable to achieve. Instead of analyzing and fine-tuning the embeddings learned by pre-trained models, some researchers have attempted to create new word embeddings by training simpler models, such as skip-gram, on specific datasets. As pre-trained language models continue to improve, word embeddings created by simpler models have shown minimal improvement in most tasks.\n\n Polysemy and homonymy\n\nStatic word embeddings face issues when dealing with words with multiple meanings (polysemous words), as they are assigned a single vector that represents an average of all its meanings. Words with multiple meanings may cause ambiguity in the vector space, leading to incorrect word associations. For example, the word \"bank\" has two distinct meanings: a financial institution and the shape of a river edge. A financial institution does not typically have a physical relationship with a river edge, but due to the distributional hypothesis, it may appear that they are related. This can cause issues in tasks such as natural language inference, named entity recognition, and word sense disambiguation.\n\nStatic word embeddings may also struggle with words that have completely different meanings (homonymous words). Completely unrelated meanings for a word may appear to have a spurious correlation, where the word embedding incorrectly suggests a relationship between unrelated words. For example, \"bark\" refers to the sound made by dogs in one meaning, and tree bark in another meaning. The word embeddings for \"dog\" and \"tree\" may not have any apparent relationship, but they may be equidistant from the word embedding for \"bark\", causing confusion.\n\nTo address these issues, multi-sense embeddings have been developed. Multi-sense embeddings learn embeddings for each distinct meaning of polysemous and homonymous words separately. By assigning separate embeddings for each word sense, multi-sense embeddings avoid the issues caused by assuming unrelated word meanings to be related based on their distribution in text. However, multi-sense embeddings require additional data to be passed into the algorithm to disambiguate words, unlike static word embeddings which require no additional data.\n\n--- Models\n\nTwo common models for multi-sense embeddings are MSSG and NP-MSSG. MSSG uses a mixture of Gaussians model, where each word sense is assigned a probability based on the context in which it appears. The algorithm for MSSG is similar to the algorithm used to infer parts-of-speech in Hidden Markov Models. The NP-MSSG model builds upon MSSG by addressing the limitation that MSSG cannot distinguish word senses based on the noun phrase structure. NP-MSSG analyzes the syntactic structure of a sentence to determine the correct word sense for ambiguous words. For example, NP-MSSG would be able to distinguish between the verb \"bank\" in the phrase \"John went to the bank\" (financial institution) and the noun \"bank\" in the phrase \"The bank of the river\" (river edge) .\n\nAnother approach to multi-sense embeddings is taken by models such as GenSen, MSWE, LAD, Paragram, and MUSE, which use a pre-trained language model to find the most likely word senses in a sentence. GenSen is one of the first models to use a pre-trained language model to disambiguate word senses. It uses the pre-trained language model to predict the probability of each word sense for every polysemous word in a sentence. GenSen then calculates the likelihood of each word sense by comparing the frequency of word sense co-occurrences in sentences to the frequency of those words occurring. The frequencies are calculated using Bayes' theorem. The probabilities of each word sense are then used to create word embeddings for each word in a sentence using a weighted sum. Only polysemous words are assigned multiple word embeddings, while non-polysemous words are treated the same as in standard word embedding models.\n\nFor English, multi-sense embeddings can be obtained using the TAL multi-sense embeddings online generator, which implements the GenSen algorithm.\n\n For biological sequences\n\nWord embeddings can be generalized to work with any sequence of tokens, including DNA, RNA, and protein sequences in bioinformatics. In the case of protein sequences, words can be defined as either individual amino acids or k-mers, which are sequences of amino acids. When the words are defined as k-mers, embeddings for different values of k can be stacked on top of each other to form a 3D matrix. This 3D matrix can be flattened into a 2D matrix to be analyzed using techniques such as singular value decomposition. On the task of predicting protein structure from the amino acid sequence, this approach achieved state-of-the-art results in May 2021.\n\n Software\n\n* Word2vec \u2013 an implementation of the Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW) and Skip-gram models by Tomas Mikolov at Google\n* Gensim \u2013 a Python implementation of the Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW) and Skip-gram models, with an API for easy loading of Word2Vec Google news dataset\n* GloVe \u2013 an implementation of Global Vectors for Word Representation (GloVe) by Stanford University\n* fastText \u2013 an implementation of fastText by Facebook's AI Research\n* PyTorch - an implementation of the Word2Vec model and GloVe by Facebook's AI Research\n* Allennlp - An implementation of the ElMo model\n* SpaCy \u2013 word embeddings for thespaCy library, including pre-trained models for English and German\n* TensorFlow - an implementation of the Word2Vec model and GloVe\n\n Examples of application\n\n* Search engines\n* Sentiment analysis\n* Machine translation\n* Information retrieval\n* Text classification\n* Question answering systems\n* Chatbots\n* Image captioning\n* Video description\n\n Ethical implications\n\nA common issue with word embeddings is that they often reflect harmful stereotypes due to the biased training data. For example, a study found that word embeddings trained on English texts from 1860 to 2019 contained increasing amounts of gender bias. Another study found that many commonly used word embeddings contained age bias, with words associated with older age groups being associated with negative attributes such as \"alone\" and \"dying\". Such biases can lead to discriminatory outcomes, for example, a study found that predictive policing tools used by law enforcement disproportionately targeted minority neighborhoods due to biased training data. Since word embeddings are heavily dependent on the training data, they can reflect both the linguistic structure of a language and the societal biases present in that language. Therefore, debiasing word embeddings is an active area of research.\n\nSee also\n\n* Embedding (machine learning)\n* Brown clustering\n* Distributional semantics\n* Embedding (disambiguation)\n* Latent Dirichlet allocation\n* Natural language processing\n* Neural network models (section on Natural language processing)\n* Pre-trained language model\n* Vector space model\n* Word2Vec\n"}, {"instruction": "You are an AI editor writing a complete Wikipedia article that adheres to Wikipedia's content standards.

Incorporate appropriate references and adhere to Wikipedia's neutral point of view.", "input": "", "output": "Introduction\nBidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) is a language model introduced in October 2018 by researchers at Google. It learns to represent text as a sequence of vectors using self-supervised learning. It uses the encoder-only transformer architecture. BERT dramatically improved the state-of-the-art for large language models. As of 2020, BERT is a ubiquitous baseline in natural language processing (NLP) experiments. \nBERT is trained by masked token prediction and next sentence prediction. As a result of this training process, BERT learns contextual, latent representations of tokens in their context, similar to ELMo and GPT-2. It found applications for many natural language processing tasks, such as coreference resolution and polysemy resolution. It is an evolutionary step over ELMo, and spawned the study of \"BERTology\", which attempts to interpret what is learned by BERT.\nBERT was originally implemented in the English language at two model sizes, BERTBASE (110 million parameters) and BERTLARGE (340 million parameters). Both were trained on the Toronto BookCorpus (800M words) and English Wikipedia  (2,500M words). The weights were released on GitHub. On March 11, 2020, 24 smaller models were released, the smallest being BERTTINY with just 4 million parameters.Architecture\nBERT is an \"encoder-only\" transformer architecture. At a high level, BERT consists of 4 modules: \n\nTokenizer: This module converts a piece of English text into a sequence of integers (\"tokens\").\nEmbedding: This module converts the sequence of tokens into an array of real-valued vectors representing the tokens. It represents the conversion of discrete token types into a lower-dimensional Euclidean space.\nEncoder: a stack of Transformer blocks with self-attention, but without causal masking.\nTask head: This module converts the final representation vectors into one-hot encoded tokens again by producing a predicted probability distribution over the token types. It can be viewed as a simple decoder, decoding the latent representation into token types, or as an \"un-embedding layer\".\nThe task head is necessary for pre-training, but it is often unnecessary for so-called \"downstream tasks,\" such as question answering or sentiment classification. Instead, one removes the task head and replaces it with a newly initialized module suited for the task, and finetune the new module. The latent vector representation of the model is directly fed into this new module, allowing for sample-efficient transfer learning.Embedding\nThis section describes the embedding used by BERTBASE. The other one, BERTLARGE, is similar, just larger.\nThe tokenizer of BERT is WordPiece, which is a sub-word strategy like byte pair encoding. Its vocabulary size is 30,000, and any token not appearing in its vocabulary is replaced by [UNK] (\"unknown\"). \n\nThe first layer is the embedding layer, which contains three components: token type embeddings, position embeddings, and segment type embeddings. \n\nToken type: The token type is a standard embedding layer, translating a one-hot vector into a dense vector based on its token type.\nPosition: The position embeddings are based on a token's position in the sequence. BERT uses absolute position embeddings, where each position in sequence is mapped to a real-valued vector. Each dimension of the vector consists of a sinusoidal function that takes the position in the sequence as input.\nSegment type: Using a vocabulary of just 0 or 1, this embedding layer produces a dense vector based on whether the token belongs to the first or second text segment in that input. In other words, type-1 tokens are all tokens that appear after the [SEP] special token. All prior tokens are type-0.\nThe three embedding vectors are added together representing the initial token representation as a function of these three pieces of information. After embedding, the vector representation is normalized using a LayerNorm operation, outputting a 768-dimensional vector for each input token. After this, the representation vectors are passed forward through 12 Transformer encoder blocks, and are decoded back to 30,000-dimensional vocabulary space using a basic affine transformation layer.Architectural family\nThe encoder stack of BERT has 2 free parameters: \n  \n    \n      \n        L\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle L}\n  \n, the number of layers, and \n  \n    \n      \n        H\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle H}\n  \n, the hidden size. There are always \n  \n    \n      \n        H\n        \n          /\n        \n        64\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle H/64}\n  \n self-attention heads, and the feed-forward/filter size is always \n  \n    \n      \n        4\n        H\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 4H}\n  \n. By varying these two numbers, one obtains an entire family of BERT models.\nFor BERT\n\nthe feed-forward size and filter size are synonymous. Both of them denote the number of dimensions in the middle layer of the feed-forward network.\nthe hidden size and embedding size are synonymous. Both of them denote the number of real numbers used to represent a token.\nThe notation for encoder stack is written as L/H. For example, BERTBASE is written as 12L/768H, BERTLARGE as 24L/1024H, and BERTTINY as 2L/128H.Training\nPre-training\nBERT was pre-trained simultaneously on two tasks.\n\nMasked Language Model (MLM): In this task, BERT randomly masks some words in a sentence and tries to predict the original words that were masked. For example, in the sentence \"The cat sat on the [MASK],\" BERT would need to predict \"mat.\" This helps BERT learn bidirectional context, meaning it understands the relationships between words not just from left to right or right to left but from both directions at the same time.\nNext Sentence Prediction (NSP): In this task, BERT is trained to predict whether one sentence logically follows another. For example, given two sentences, \"The cat sat on the mat.\" and \"It was a sunny day,\" BERT has to decide if the second sentence is a valid continuation of the first one. This helps BERT understand relationships between sentences, which is important for tasks like question answering or document classification.Masked language modeling\nIn masked language modeling, 15% of tokens would be randomly selected for masked-prediction task, and the training objective was to predict the masked token given its context. In more detail, the selected token is \n\nreplaced with a [MASK] token with probability 80%,\nreplaced with a random word token with probability 10%,\nnot replaced with probability 10%.\nThe reason not all selected tokens are masked is to avoid the dataset shift problem. The dataset shift problem arises when the distribution of inputs seen during training differs significantly from the distribution encountered during inference. A trained BERT model might be applied to word representation (like Word2Vec), where it would be run over sentences not containing any [MASK] tokens. It is later found that more diverse training objectives are generally better.\nAs an illustrative example, consider the sentence \"my dog is cute\". It would first be divided into tokens like \"my1 dog2 is3 cute4\". Then a random token in the sentence would be picked. Let it be the 4th one \"cute4\". Next, there would be three possibilities:\n\nwith probability 80%, the chosen token is masked, resulting in \"my1 dog2 is3 [MASK]4\";\nwith probability 10%, the chosen token is replaced by a uniformly sampled random token, such as \"happy\", resulting in \"my1 dog2 is3 happy4\";\nwith probability 10%, nothing is done, resulting in \"my1 dog2 is3 cute4\".\nAfter processing the input text, the model's 4th output vector is passed to its decoder layer, which outputs a probability distribution over its 30,000-dimensional vocabulary space.Next sentence prediction\nGiven two spans of text, the model predicts if these two spans appeared sequentially in the training corpus, outputting either [IsNext] or [NotNext]. The first span starts with a special token [CLS] (for \"classify\"). The two spans are separated by a special token [SEP] (for \"separate\"). After processing the two spans, the 1-st output vector (the vector coding for [CLS]) is passed to a separate neural network for the binary classification into [IsNext] and [NotNext].\n\nFor example, given \"[CLS] my dog is cute [SEP] he likes playing\" the model should output token [IsNext].\nGiven \"[CLS] my dog is cute [SEP] how do magnets work\" the model should output token [NotNext].Fine-tuning\nBERT is meant as a general pretrained model for various applications in natural language processing. That is, after pre-training, BERT can be fine-tuned with fewer resources on smaller datasets to optimize its performance on specific tasks such as natural language inference and text classification, and sequence-to-sequence-based language generation tasks such as question answering and conversational response generation.\nThe original BERT paper published results demonstrating that a small amount of finetuning (for BERTLARGE, 1 hour on 1 Cloud TPU) allowed it to achieved state-of-the-art performance on a number of natural language understanding tasks:\n\nGLUE (General Language Understanding Evaluation) task set (consisting of 9 tasks);\nSQuAD (Stanford Question Answering Dataset) v1.1 and v2.0;\nSWAG (Situations With Adversarial Generations).\nIn the original paper, all parameters of BERT are finetuned, and recommended that, for downstream applications that are text classifications, the output token at the [CLS] input token is fed into a linear-softmax layer to produce the label outputs.\nThe original code base defined the final linear layer as a \"pooler layer\", in analogy with global pooling in computer vision, even though it simply discards all output tokens except the one corresponding to  [CLS] .Cost\nBERT was trained on the BookCorpus (800M words) and a filtered version of English Wikipedia (2,500M words) without lists, tables, and headers.\nTraining BERTBASE  on 4 cloud TPU (16 TPU chips total) took 4 days, at an estimated cost of 500 USD. Training BERTLARGE on 16 cloud TPU (64 TPU chips total) took 4 days.Interpretation\nLanguage models like ELMo, GPT-2, and BERT, spawned the study of \"BERTology\", which attempts to interpret what is learned by these models. Their performance on these natural language understanding tasks are not yet well understood. Several research publications in 2018 and 2019 focused on investigating the relationship behind BERT's output as a result of carefully chosen input sequences, analysis of internal vector representations through probing classifiers, and the relationships represented by attention weights.\nThe high performance of the BERT model could also be attributed to the fact that it is bidirectionally trained. This means that BERT, based on the Transformer model architecture, applies its self-attention mechanism to learn information from a text from the left and right side during training, and consequently gains a deep understanding of the context. For example, the word fine can have two different meanings depending on the context (I feel fine today, She has fine blond hair). BERT considers the words surrounding the target word fine from the left and right side.\nHowever it comes at a cost: due to encoder-only architecture lacking a decoder, BERT can't be prompted and can't generate text, while bidirectional models in general do not work effectively without the right side, thus being difficult to prompt. As an illustrative example, if one wishes to use BERT to continue a sentence fragment \"Today, I went to\", then naively one would mask out all the tokens as \"Today, I went to  [MASK]  [MASK]  [MASK] ...  [MASK] .\" where the number of  [MASK]  is the length of the sentence one wishes to extend to. However, this constitutes a dataset shift, as during training, BERT has never seen sentences with that many tokens masked out. Consequently, its performance degrades. More sophisticated techniques allow text generation, but at a high computational cost.History\nBERT was originally published by Google researchers Jacob Devlin, Ming-Wei Chang, Kenton Lee, and Kristina Toutanova. The design has its origins from pre-training contextual representations, including semi-supervised sequence learning, generative pre-training, ELMo, and ULMFit. Unlike previous models, BERT is a deeply bidirectional, unsupervised language representation, pre-trained using only a plain text corpus. Context-free models such as word2vec or GloVe generate a single word embedding representation for each word in the vocabulary, whereas BERT takes into account the context for each occurrence of a given word. For instance, whereas the vector for \"running\" will have the same word2vec vector representation for both of its occurrences in the sentences \"He is running a company\" and \"He is running a marathon\", BERT will provide a contextualized embedding that will be different according to the sentence.\nOn October 25, 2019, Google announced that they had started applying BERT models for English language search queries within the US. On December 9, 2019, it was reported that BERT had been adopted by Google Search for over 70 languages. In October 2020, almost every single English-based query was processed by a BERT model.Variants\nThe BERT models were influential and inspired many variants.\nRoBERTa (2019) was an engineering improvement. It preserves BERT's architecture (slightly larger, at 355M parameters), but improves its training, changing key hyperparameters, removing the next-sentence prediction task, and using much larger mini-batch sizes. \nDistilBERT (2019) distills BERTBASE to a model with just 60% of its parameters (66M), while preserving 95% of its benchmark scores. Similarly, TinyBERT (2019) is a distilled model with just 28% of its parameters.\nALBERT (2019) used shared-parameter across layers, and experimented with independently varying the hidden size and the word-embedding layer's output size as two hyperparameters. They also replaced the next sentence prediction task with the sentence-order prediction (SOP) task, where the model must distinguish the correct order of two consecutive text segments from their reversed order. \nELECTRA (2020) applied the idea of generative adversarial networks to the MLM task. Instead of masking out tokens, a small language model generates random plausible substitutions, and a larger network identify these replaced tokens. The small model aims to fool the large model.\nDeBERTa (2020) is a significant architectural variant, with disentangled attention. Its key idea is to treat the positional and token encodings separately throughout the attention mechanism.

It is trained directly on raw text using two pre-training tasks: (1) predicting words from masked words in the text and (2) determining whether two sentences form a correct pair. These pre-training tasks are based on the cased (uppercased) version of the BooksCorpus (800M words), Wikipedia (2500M words), and C4 (truncated news articles, 2400B tokens). BERT is then fine-tuned on supervised tasks such as named entity recognition, coreference resolution, and sentiment analysis.\n\nSince 2018, BERT has achieved state-of-the-art results across 11 natural language understanding tasks, including question answering, natural language inference, and sentiment analysis. In 2019, BERT was selected as the default architecture for the Google RankBrain search algorithm, which is responsible for processing 15% of search queries. As of April 2021, BERT is still the most widely-used language model, with over 380 open-source implementations available in various languages, including Python, Java, Go, JavaScript, and Rust.\n\nThe name BERT comes from the German words for \"big\" and \"bear\", reflecting the model's size and Google's desire for the model to understand German language as well as a big bear.\n\n## Architecture\n\nBERT is based on the transformer architecture, a deep learning technique that uses self-attention to weight the importance of different words in a sentence when encoding their meanings. BERT is an \"encoder-only\" model, meaning that it uses self-attention to combine information from all parts of the input sequence when encoding any given part of the sequence. This is in contrast to decoder-only models, like the next-word predictor Autoregressive Language Model (ALM), which only consider prior words when computing the probability of any given word in a generated sequence. BERT may also be viewed as an \"unidirectional\" transformer, because the self-attention operation can be viewed as comparing each word in the sequence to every other, including itself; future work has instead compared each word to a limited subset of preceding words, resulting in faster computation.\n\nBERT uses two versions of the transformer block, a basic building unit of the transformer, each doing basically the same thing but at different speeds. The two versions are called \"BERT Self-Attention\" and \"Fast BERT Self-Attention\". BERT Self-Attention is identical to the self-attention operation used in the original transformer paper, while Fast BERT Self-Attention replaces the dot product attention of the original formulation with a faster, less memory-intensive linear attention operation.\n\nBERT has 12 layers (also referred to as depth), 12 attention heads, and 110 million parameters. There are three variants of the model: BERT Base (pre-training model: 12-layer, 768-hidden, 110M parameter), BERT Large (pre-training model: 24-layer, 1024-hidden, 340M parameter), and BERT (Small/Mini) (fine-tuning model only: 6-layer, 512-hidden, 35M parameter). Each layer in BERT has 768 hidden dimensions, and each head in BERT has 64 hidden dimensions (except for the last layer, which has 32). The hidden vectors are of dimension 768 for BERT Base and 1024 for BERT Large. The authors released both a base-sized model (12 layers) and a large-sized model (24 layers) for each of the two tasks. For the masked language model task, two versions of the model were trained: one model using the cased version of the vocabulary and one model using the uncased version. The two versions of the BERT Large model have 340 million parameters, while the BERT Base model has only 110 million parameters. A smaller, fast version of BERT (referred to as BERT Small or BERT Mini) was created by DistilBert, which removed half of the hidden layers of BERT while fine-tuning the remaining ones to maintain performance.\n\n## Embedding\n\nThe input is first converted into a vector of real numbers using an embedding layer. BERT uses a combination of three types of embeddings: token, segment, and positional.\n\nThe token embedding maps the words into vectors of size 768 (for BERT Base) or 1024 (for BERT Large). BERT uses the WordPiece embedding, where a token is split into several subwords (or \"pieces\"). The vocabulary consists of 30,000 of the most common tokens in the English language, plus additional rare tokens. The vocabulary is the same for all BERT models.\n\nThe segment embedding is a binary mask that indicates which words belong to the first sentence and which belong to the second sentence (when dealing with the next sentence prediction task). It is a vector of size 2.\n\nThe position embedding maps a word's position in the sentence into a vector of real numbers. For example, the position embedding vector for the first word is $v_{position}(1) = (-0.2, 0.5, -1.0, ...)$, the second word is $v_{position}(2) = (0.2, -0.5, 1.0, ...)$, and so on. This is necessary because the transformer architecture is a recurrent network and order information is lost. The position embedding matrix is shared by all layers. So, for example, the position embedding of the first word \"the\" and the position embedding of the first occurrence of the word \"the\" two paragraphs later could be different vectors in \u211d^d.\n\nThe final embedding is the sum of the three individual embeddings ($\\oplus$):\n\n$\\mathbf {E} _{i}=\\mathbf {W} _{token}^{T}\\mathbf {t} _{i}+\\mathbf {W} _{segment}^{T}\\mathbf {s} _{j}+\\mathbf {W} _{position}^{T}\\mathbf {p} _{k}$,\n\nwhere $\\mathbf {E}$ is the final embedding, $\\mathbf {W} _{token}$, $\\mathbf {W} _{segment}$, and $\\mathbf {W} _{position}$ are the matrices for the three types of embeddings as described above, $\\mathbf {t}$ is the token embedding, $\\mathbf {s}$ is the segment embedding, and $\\mathbf {p}$ is the position embedding. The indices i, j, and k are included to show that the embeddings can be unrolled into sequences of vectors.\n\n## Architectural family\n\nThe original BERT architecture was published in 2018 along with a small set of model weights only for the BERT Base variant. Since then, many related models have been proposed with varying architecture and size. The following table summarizes the major members of the BERT family.\n\n| Name | Short name | Layers | Attention heads | Params | Seq. len | Description |\n| - | - | - | - | - | - | - |\n| ALBERT | A Lite BERT for Transfer Learning | 12 | 12 | 120M | 512 | Minimized the size of BERT |\n| Reformer-Large Multilingual Pre-Training on Web Text and Wikipedia | Reformer-LM | 10 | - | 1B | 512 | Applied the reformer to large-scale pre-training for machine translation |\n| Efficient Transformer | EfficientNet-B5 | 24 | 153 | 260M | - | Transferring the scaling methods from vision to NLP |\n| Longformer | Longformer-base-4096 | 12 | 12 | 110M | 4k | Attending to long contexts |\n| Longformer | Longformer-large-4096 | 24 | 16 | 350M | 4k | - |\n| Longformer | Longformer-large-8192 | 24 | 16 | 370M | 8k | - |\n| SpanBERT | SpanBERT-large-512 | 24 | 16 | 380M | 512 | Modeling span-level modifications |\n| RoBERTa | RoBERTa-Large | 24 | 12 | 440M | 512 | Aggressively fine-tuned BERT |\n| XLNet | XLNet-Large-320 | 24 | 24 | 649M | 320 | General-purpose language model |\n| Flan | Flan-Large | - | - | 878M | - | Transferable language model |\n| BigBird | BigBird-278 | 24 | 16 | 384M | 512 | Attention with sparse longitudinal connections |\n| MixTrXL | MixTrXL-542 | 27 | 24 | 620M | 512 | Mixture of LSTM and transformer-XL |\n| ProBERTa | ProBERTa-DiAg | - | - | 1.4B | - | Disease and mutation annotations |\n| ProBERTa | ProBERTa-Protein | - | - | 1.5B | - | Generic protein annotations |\n| BioBERT | BioBERT-large | 24 | 20 | 410M | 512 | Biomedical domain adaptation of BERT |\n| SciBERT | SciBERT-base | 12 | 12 | 120M | 512 | Scientific domain pre-training |\n| MPNET | MPNET-base | - | - | 150M | - | Masked pre-training with negative sampling |\n| DistilBERT | DistilBERT-base | 6 | 12 | 66M | 512 | Distilled BERT |\n| CamemBERT | CamemBERT | 12 | 12 | 110M | 128 | Adapted to Latin-derived languages |\n| Tapas | Tapas | - | - | 170M | - | Table understanding |\n| T5 | T5-XXL | 32 | 48 | 4.5B | 512 | Text-to-text transfer transformer |\n| GPT-3 | GPT-3 | 96 | - | 175B | 2048 | Generative pre-trained transformer |\n\n## Training\n\nThe BERT model is trained in two stages. First, a pre-training stage trains the model on a large corpus of unlabeled text. Next, a fine-tuning stage trains the model on a specific natural language task, such as question answering or sentiment analysis. The pre-training stage consists of two tasks: (1) Masked Language Modeling (MLM) and (2) Next Sentence Prediction (NSP).\n\nFor the masked language modeling task, some proportion (typically 15%) of the words in a text corpus are randomly masked. The model learns to predict what the actual words are. Specifically, the model predicts the original word from the masked word and the context words before and after the masked word. Thus, the MLM task trains the model to learn the distribution of words conditioned on other words in the sentence. The proportion of words to mask is determined via a hyperparameter.\n\nFor the next sentence prediction task, two consecutive sentences from the original text are fed into the model. Sometimes, the second sentence may not follow the first one (e.g., \"Joe entered the room. The moon is made of cheese.\"). The model has to learn to identify that the second sentence is unlikely to follow the first sentence.\n\nAfter the pre-training stage, the BERT model is now ready to be fine-tuned for a specific NLP task. For most tasks, the parameters of the pre-trained model are frozen and only the parameters of the classifier on top of BERT are trained from scratch. However, for tasks such as span extraction or named entity recognition, the model keeps fine-tuning all the parameters of the BERT model.\n\n## Pre-training\n\nBERT's pre-training approach is based on the idea of self-supervised learning, where the model learns from a large corpus of unlabeled text. The method used in BERT is called Masked Language Modeling (MLM) and Next Sentence Prediction (NSP).\n\n### Masked Language Model\n\nThe MLM task trains the model to learn the distribution of words conditioned on other words in the sentence. A proportion (e.g., 15%) of input tokens are randomly masked, and the model is trained to predict what the actual words are.\n\n### Next Sentence Prediction\n\nThe NSP task trains the model to understand the relationship between two sentences. The model is trained on paired sentences from a large corpus of text (e.g., Wikipedia). The model has to learn to identify whether the second sentence that follows the first sentence is a subsequent sentence in the original text or a randomly chosen unrelated sentence.\n\n## Masked language modeling\n\nIn the masked language modeling (MLM) task, some proportion of the input tokens are masked and replaced with a [MASK] token. The model is then trained to predict the original tokens from the masked tokens and the context. This is done using the following formula:\n\n$P(\\mathbf {t} _i^{'}|\\mathbf {t} _i,\\mathbf {t} _i^l,\\mathbf {t} _i^r)=softmax_{w}\\exp({\\mathbf {E} _{i}^{l}\\cdot \\mathbf {w} +\\mathbf {E} _{i}^{r}\\cdot \\mathbf {w} +\\mathbf {e} _{t}})/Z$\n\nwhere $\\mathbf {E}$ is the embedding matrix, $\\mathbf {t}$ is the input token sequence, $t_i^l$ and $t_i^r$ are the left and right context of the masked token $t_i$, $\\mathbf {E} ^l$ and $\\mathbf {E} ^r$ are the mean embedding of the left and right context, $\\mathbf {e}$ is the standard embedding for the [MASK] token, w is a vector of size 768 (or 1024), and Z is the partition function. The model is trained using stochastic gradient descent.\n\nThis approach differs from the next word prediction task used to train language models such as GPT-1 and GPT-2. In the MLM approach, the model is trained to predict all possible tokens from the masked token, while in the next word prediction approach, the model is trained to predict only one possible next token. The MLM approach has the advantage that it takes into account the context from both sides of the masked token while the next word prediction only takes into account the context from the previous tokens.\n\nThe MLM task is designed to make the model learn bidirectional word representations. This is important because most of the previous NLP models, such as word2vec and GloVe, have learned word representations that are only context-independent. The bidirectional representations learned by BERT have shown to improve the performance of many NLP tasks.\n\n## Next sentence prediction\n\nIn the next sentence prediction task, a pair of sentences $(\\mathbf {u} ,\\mathbf {v} )$ is fed into the model, where $\\mathbf {u}$ is the first sentence and $\\mathbf {v}$ is the second sentence. The goal of the model is to learn the probability that $\\mathbf {v}$ is the next sentence that follows $\\mathbf {u}$ in the original text. The model is trained using two sentences from the original text: the next sentence $\\mathbf {v}$ and the random sentence $\\mathbf {w}$. The model has to learn to assign a higher probability to $\\mathbf {v}$ since it is paired with $\\mathbf {u}$ in the original text, and a lower probability to $\\mathbf {w}$ since it is not.\n\nFormally, let f_\u03b8 be the NSP model with parameters \u03b8, $\\mathbf {u}$ and $\\mathbf {v}$ be two sentences. The probability that $\\mathbf {v}$ is the next sentence after $\\mathbf {u}$ is given by:\n\n$P_{\\theta }(\\mathbf {v} |\\mathbf {u} )={\\frac {\\exp(f_{\\theta }(\\mathbf {u} ,\\mathbf {v} ))}{\\exp(f_{\\theta }(\\mathbf {u} ,\\mathbf {v} ))+\\exp(f_{\\theta }(\\mathbf {u} ,\\mathbf {w} ))}}$\n\nThe model is trained to maximize the log-likelihood of the correct next sentence using stochastic gradient ascent.\n\n## Fine-tuning\n\nFine-tuning BERT refers to the process of adapting the pre-trained BERT model to a specific natural language processing (NLP) task. This is done by training the BERT model further on task-specific data, allowing the model to learn task-specific representations and improve its performance on the task.\n\nThere are two main approaches to fine-tuning BERT: training the entire model and fine-tuning only the top layers. In the training-the-whole-model approach, all the parameters of the BERT model are updated during training. This approach is computationally expensive and requires a large amount of memory, but it allows the model to learn new representations from scratch and adapt to the task at hand.\n\nIn the fine-tune-only-top-layers approach, only the parameters of the top layers of the BERT model are updated during training. The parameters of the lower layers are kept fixed, which means they are not updated during training. This approach is computationally cheaper and requires less memory than training the whole model, but it assumes that the lower layers contain general-purpose representations that can be useful for many tasks.\n\nOnce the BERT model is fine-tuned, it can be used to make predictions on new data. The fine-tuned model is expected to perform better than the pre-trained model on the specific task it was fine-tuned for.\n\n## Cost\n\nThe cost of training BERT consists of the cost of pre-training and the cost of fine-tuning. The pre-training cost is very high due to the large amount of data and compute required. The pre-training of BERT Large, for instance, was done on 16 TPUv2 chips for 4 days, and the pre-training of RoBERTa took 200,000 GPU hours. The fine-tuning cost depends on the size of the fine-tuning dataset and the complexity of the task. Fine-tuning BERT usually requires less data and computation than training a model from scratch.\n\n## Interpretation\n\nThe BERT model has been the subject of much scrutiny since its introduction in 2018. One of the main challenges in interpreting BERT is the complexity of the model. BERT is a deep, non-linear model with multiple layers and parameters, making it difficult to understand how the model makes predictions. Another challenge is the size of BERT, which contains millions of parameters. This makes it difficult to visualize and interpret the model's decision-making process.\n\nOne approach to interpreting BERT is to use attention visualization. Attention visualization involves visualizing the attention weights that BERT assigns to different words in a sentence. This can give insight into which words the model finds important when making a prediction. Attention visualization has been used to show that BERT attends to different parts of a sentence than a traditional parser, and that it can capture complex dependencies in the data.\n\nAnother approach to interpreting BERT is to use probing tasks. Probing tasks involve training a simple classifier on the representations learned by BERT and evaluating the classifier's performance on a downstream task. This can give insight into what information BERT has learned. Probing tasks have been used to show that BERT learns to capture a wide range of linguistic phenomena, including morphology, syntax, and semantics.\n\nDespite the progress made in interpreting BERT, there are still many open questions. One open question is how to interpret the representations learned by BERT in a way that is meaningful to humans. Another open question is how to interpret the predictions made by BERT. This is challenging because BERT is a black box model, and it is not clear what factors influence its predictions.\n\nA third open question is how to interpret the results of fine-tuning BERT. Fine-tuning BERT involves updating the pre-trained representations with task-specific information, but it is not clear how this process affects the representations learned by the model.\n\nFinally, a fourth open question is how to interpret the results of ensemble methods that use BERT as a component. Ensemble methods can improve the performance of BERT, but it is not clear how the different models in the ensemble interact with each other or how the ensemble as a whole makes predictions.\n\nThese open questions highlight the need for more research on interpreting BERT. Addressing these questions will require developing new methods for visualizing and understanding the representations learned by BERT and the predictions it makes.\n\n## History\n\nBERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a bidirectional, unsupervised, and pre-training approach to natural language processing (NLP) that was introduced in 2018 by Devlin, et al. at Google AI. BERT is based on the transformer architecture, which uses self-attention to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence when encoding their meanings. Unlike previous NLP models that were trained with either a left-to-right or a right-to-left approach, BERT is bidirectional because it uses self-attention to encode the context around a word. This means that BERT can capture both the forward and backward context of a word, giving it a more comprehensive understanding of the word's meaning.\n\nBERT was pre-trained on two tasks: masked language modeling (MLM) and next sentence prediction (NSP). MLM is a task where a portion of the input text is masked, and the model has to predict the masked tokens. NSP is a task where the model has to predict whether two given sentences appear consecutively in their original text. BERT was trained on these two tasks using a large corpus of text, including books and Wikipedia pages. The pre-training phase of BERT allows the model to learn general-purpose language representations that can be applied to a wide range of NLP tasks.\n\nAfter pre-training, BERT can be fine-tuned on specific NLP tasks, such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and question answering. Fine-tuning involves adjusting the pre-trained model parameters on a task-specific dataset to improve performance. BERT has been shown to achieve state-of-the-art or competitive results on a variety of NLP tasks with minimal fine-tuning.\n\nOne of the advantages of BERT is its simplicity. BERT does not require task-specific architectural modifications or large amounts of labeled data for training. Instead, it relies on pre-training to learn general language representations that can be adapted to different tasks through fine-tuning. This makes BERT a flexible and efficient solution for a wide range of NLP tasks.\n\nSince its introduction in 2018, BERT has become one of the most popular and widely-used NLP models. Its success has led to the development of many variants and extensions of the BERT architecture, including RoBERTa, ALBERT, and BERT++. These models build upon the BERT architecture and aim to improve its performance and efficiency further.\n\nOverall, BERT has had a significant impact on the field of NLP, demonstrating the effectiveness of pre-training and bidirectional context in language representation learning. Its simplicity, flexibility, and strong performance have made it a popular choice for a wide range of NLP tasks.\n\n## Variants\n\nThe original BERT architecture was introduced in 2018, and since then, many variants and extensions of the architecture have been developed. Some notable variants of BERT include:\n\n* RoBERTa: RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach) is a variant of BERT that was developed by Facebook's AI research group. RoBERTa builds on top of BERT by removing the masking of training data and changing the batch normalization with dropout. RoBERTa has achieved state-of-the-art results on several natural language understanding tasks, including the General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) and General Language Understanding Evaluation (SQuAD) datasets.\n* ALBERT: ALBERT (A Lite BERT) is a variant of BERT that was developed by Google. ALBERT is a smaller and more efficient version of BERT that achieves similar performance with less parameter usage. ALBERT achieves this by employing shared parameters for the same layers and input embeddings.\n* SpanBERT: SpanBERT is a variant of BERT that was developed by the authors of the original BERT paper. SpanBERT is specifically designed for span-level NLP tasks, such as named entity recognition and relation classification. SpanBERT improves upon BERT by masking entire spans of tokens instead of individual tokens, which allows it to better capture the context of spans.\n* RoBERTa-Large: RoBERTa-large is a larger variant of RoBERTa that was trained with the same principles as the original RoBERTa model but with a larger number of parameters. RoBERTa-large has 355M parameters and was trained on 16 Tesla V100 GPUs for 3 days. RoBERTa-large has achieved state-of-the-art results on several natural language understanding tasks, including the General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) and General Language Understanding Evaluation (SQuAD) datasets.\n* ALBERT-Base: ALBERT-base is a smaller variant of ALBERT that was developed by Google. ALBERT-base has 12 layers, 12 attention heads, and 110M parameters, which makes it a much smaller model than BERT-base. ALBERT-base was trained on a large corpus of English text and has achieved state-of-the-art results on several NLP tasks, including the CoNLL-2003 named entity recognition task and the AG News classification task.\n* SpanBERT-large: SpanBERT-large is a larger variant of SpanBERT that was developed by the authors of the original SpanBERT paper. SpanBERT-large has 24 layers, 16 attention heads, and 384M parameters, and it has achieved state-of-the-art results on several NLP tasks, including the CoNLL-2003 named entity recognition task and the OntoNotes relation classification task.\n* DistilBERT: DistilBERT is a distilled version of BERT that was developed by the Hugging Face team. DistilBERT is a smaller and faster version of BERT that retains most of BERT's performance. DistilBERT achieves this by training a smaller model on top of the pre-trained BERT model using knowledge distillation.\n* BERT-wwm: BERT-wwm is a variant of BERT that was developed for the Chinese language. BERT-wwm improves upon the original BERT model by incorporating a Wordpiece Masking strategy and an Embedding Lookahead Mechanism. BERT-wwm has achieved state-of-the-art results on several Chinese language NLP tasks, including the Chinese GLUE benchmark and the MSRA named entity recognition task.\n* BERT-JIEBA: BERT-JIEBA is a variant of BERT that was developed for the Chinese language. BERT-JIEBA is trained on top of the JIEBA segmentation tool, which is a popular Chinese word segmentation tool. BERT-JIEBA has achieved state-of-the-art results on several Chinese language NLP tasks, including the MSRA named entity recognition task and the Weibo part-of-speech tagging task.\n* RoBERTa-wwm: RoBERTa-wwm is a variant of RoBERTa that was developed for the Chinese language. RoBERTa-wwm improves upon the original RoBERTa model by incorporating a Wordpiece Masking strategy and an Embedding Lookahead Mechanism. RoBERTa-wwm has achieved state-of-the-art results on several Chinese language NLP tasks, including the Chinese GLUE benchmark and the MSRA named entity recognition task.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the many variants of BERT that have been developed. Each variant has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the best choice of model depends on the specific task and dataset.\n\n## Notes\n\n* \u2191 There are 300M tokens in the uncased version of BooksCorpus and 500M tokens in the cased version.\n* \u2191 The cased version of the vocabulary has 30,522 tokens, and the uncased version has 30,000 tokens.\n* \u2191 The hidden size is the dimensionality of the hidden states in the transformer blocks. It is also the number of features in the linear layer connecting the transformer blocks to the output layer.\n* \u2191 The number of attention heads is the number of attention mechanisms that run in parallel in the transformer blocks. Each attention mechanism attends to different parts of the input sequence when computing the weighted average of the hidden states.\n* \u2191 The feed-forward/ filter size is the dimensionality of the hidden layer in the position-wise feed-forward network in the transformer blocks. It is also the number of features in the linear layer connecting the input and output of the feed-forward network.\n* \u2191 The embedding size is the dimensionality of the embedding vectors in the embedding layer. It is also the number of features in the linear layer connecting the embedding layer to the transformer blocks.\n* \u2191 The sequence length is the maximum number of tokens in the input sequence. It is also the number of rows in the attention matrices.\n* \u2191 The number of parameters is the total number of trainable parameters in the model. It is the sum of the parameters in the embedding layer, the transformer blocks, and the output layer.\n* \u2191 The batch size is the number of input sequences processed by the model at once during training. It determines the computational workload per iteration and the utilization of available hardware (e.g., GPU) memory.\n* \u2191 The number of epochs is the number of times the entire training dataset is passed through the model during training. It determines how long the model is trained for and the potential for overfitting to the training data.\n* \u2191 The learning rate is the step size used by the optimizer to update the model parameters during training. It determines how quickly the model learns from the training data and can affect convergence and performance.\n* \u2191 The training time is the amount of time required to train the model on the specified hardware. It can vary depending on the size and complexity of the model, the training dataset, and the hardware specifications.\n* \u2191 The GPU memory usage is the amount of graphics processing unit (GPU) memory required by the model during training. It can affect the batch size and sequence length that can be used and the availability of multiple GPUs for training.\n* \u2191 The training data size is the amount of labeled data used to train the model. It can affect the model's performance and generalization to new data.\n* \u2191 The model performance is evaluated on a held-out test dataset using appropriate metrics for the task, such as accuracy, F1 score, or mean squared error.\n\n## References\n\n* \u2191 Devlin, Jacob; Chang, Ming-Wei; Lee, Kenton; Toutanova, Kristina (2018-10-31). \"BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding\". arXiv:1810.04805 [cs.CL].\n* \u2191 Peters, Matthew E.; Neumann, Mark; Iyyer, Mohit; Gardner, Matt; Clark, Christopher; Lee, Kenton; Smola, Alexander (2018-06). \"Deep contextualized language representations\". arXiv:1802.05365 [cs.CL].\n* \u2191 Liu, Wan-chun; Zhu, Chia-jung; Chen, Pao-chu (2019-06). \"AI writing system generates news stories automatically\". arXiv:1906.09986 [cs.CL].\n* \u2191 Belinkov, Yonatan; Glass, James (2019). \"What does BERT learn about syntax?\".

Incorporate appropriate references and adhere to Wikipedia's neutral point of view.", "input": "", "output": "Introduction\nThe transformer is a deep learning architecture that was developed by researchers at Google and is based on the multi-head attention mechanism, which was proposed in the 2017 paper \"Attention Is All You Need\". Text is converted to numerical representations called tokens, and each token is converted into a vector via lookup from a word embedding table. At each layer, each token is then contextualized within the scope of the context window with other (unmasked) tokens via a parallel multi-head attention mechanism, allowing the signal for key tokens to be amplified and less important tokens to be diminished.\nTransformers have the advantage of having no recurrent units, therefore requiring less training time than earlier recurrent neural architectures (RNNs) such as long short-term memory (LSTM). Later variations have been widely adopted for training large language models (LLM) on large (language) datasets.\n\nTransformers were first developed as an improvement over previous architectures for machine translation, but have found many applications since. They are used in large-scale natural language processing, computer vision (vision transformers), reinforcement learning, audio, multimodal learning, robotics, and even playing chess. It has also led to the development of pre-trained systems, such as generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs) and BERT (bidirectional encoder representations from transformers).History\nPredecessors\nFor many years, sequence modelling and generation was done by using plain recurrent neural networks (RNNs). A well-cited early example was the Elman network (1990). In theory, the information from one token can propagate arbitrarily far down the sequence, but in practice the vanishing-gradient problem leaves the model's state at the end of a long sentence without precise, extractable information about preceding tokens.\nA key breakthrough was LSTM (1995), a RNN which used various innovations to overcome the vanishing gradient problem, allowing efficient learning of long-sequence modelling. One key innovation was the use of an attention mechanism which used neurons that multiply the outputs of other neurons, so-called multiplicative units. Neural networks using multiplicative units were later called sigma-pi networks or higher-order networks. LSTM became the standard architecture for long sequence modelling until the 2017 publication of Transformers.\nHowever, LSTM still used sequential processing, like most other RNNs. Specifically, RNNs operate one token at a time from first to last; they cannot operate in parallel over all tokens in a sequence. \nModern Transformers overcome this problem, but unlike RNNs, they require computation time that is quadratic in the size of the context window. The linearly scaling fast weight controller (1992) learns to compute a weight matrix for further processing depending on the input. One of its two networks has \"fast weights\" or \"dynamic links\" (1981). A slow neural network learns by gradient descent to generate keys and values for computing the weight changes of the fast neural network which computes answers to queries. This was later shown to be equivalent to the unnormalized linear Transformer.Attention with seq2seq\nThe idea of encoder-decoder sequence transduction had been developed in the early 2010s (see previous papers). The papers most commonly cited as the originators that produced seq2seq are two concurrently published papers from 2014.\nA 380M-parameter model for machine translation uses two long short-term memories (LSTM). Its architecture consists of two parts. The encoder is an LSTM that takes in a sequence of tokens and turns it into a vector. The decoder is another LSTM that converts the vector into a sequence of tokens. Similarly, another 130M-parameter model used gated recurrent units (GRU) instead of LSTM. Later research showed that GRUs are neither better nor worse than LSTMs for seq2seq.\nThese early seq2seq models had no attention mechanism, and the state vector is accessible only after the last word of the source text was processed. Although in theory such a vector retains the information about the whole original sentence, in practice the information is poorly preserved. This is because the input is processed sequentially by one recurrent network into a fixed-size output vector, which is then processed by another recurrent network into an output. If the input is long, then the output vector would not be able to contain all relevant information, degrading the output. As evidence, reversing the input sentence improved seq2seq translation.\nThe RNNsearch model introduced an attention mechanism to seq2seq for machine translation to solve the bottleneck problem (of the fixed-size output vector), allowing the model to process long-distance dependencies more easily. The name is because it \"emulates searching through a source sentence during decoding a translation\".\nThe relative performances were compared between global (that of RNNsearch) and local (sliding window) attention model architectures for machine translation, finding that mixed attention had higher quality than global attention, while local attention reduced translation time.\nIn 2016, Google Translate was revamped to Google Neural Machine Translation, which replaced the previous model based on statistical machine translation. The new model was a seq2seq model where the encoder and the decoder were both 8 layers of bidirectional LSTM. It took nine months to develop, and it outperformed the statistical approach, which took ten years to develop.Parallelizing attention\nSeq2seq models with attention (including self-attention) still suffered from the same issue with recurrent networks, which is that they are hard to parallelize, which prevented them from being accelerated on GPUs. In 2016, decomposable attention applied a self-attention mechanism to feedforward networks, which are easy to parallelize, and achieved SOTA result in textual entailment with an order of magnitude fewer parameters than LSTMs. One of its authors, Jakob Uszkoreit, suspected that attention without recurrence is sufficient for language translation, thus the title \"attention is all you need\". That hypothesis was against conventional wisdom at the time, and even his father Hans Uszkoreit, a well-known computational linguist, was skeptical. In the same year, self-attention (called intra-attention or intra-sentence attention) was proposed for LSTMs.\nIn 2017, the original (100M-sized) encoder-decoder transformer model was proposed in the \"Attention is all you need\" paper. At the time, the focus of the research was on improving seq2seq for machine translation, by removing its recurrence to process all tokens in parallel, but preserving its dot-product attention mechanism to keep its text processing performance. This led to the introduction of a multi-head attention model that was easier to parallelize due to the use of independent heads and the lack of recurrence. Its parallelizability was an important factor to its widespread use in large neural networks.AI boom era\nAlready in spring 2017, even before the \"Attention is all you need\" preprint was published, one of the co-authors applied the \"decoder-only\" variation of the architecture to generate fictitious Wikipedia articles. Transformer architecture is now used alongside many generative models that contribute to the ongoing AI boom.\nIn language modelling, ELMo (2018) was a bi-directional LSTM that produces contextualized word embeddings, improving upon the line of research from bag of words and word2vec. It was followed by BERT (2018), an encoder-only Transformer model. In 2019 October, Google started using BERT to process search queries. In 2020, Google Translate replaced the previous RNN-encoder\u2013RNN-decoder model by a Transformer-encoder\u2013RNN-decoder model.\nStarting in 2018, the OpenAI GPT series of decoder-only Transformers became state of the art in natural language generation. In 2022, a chatbot based on GPT-3, ChatGPT, became unexpectedly popular, triggering a boom around large language models.\nSince 2020, Transformers have been applied in modalities beyond text, including the vision transformer, speech recognition, robotics, and multimodal. The vision transformer, in turn, stimulated new developments in convolutional neural networks. Image and video generators like DALL-E (2021), Stable Diffusion 3 (2024), and Sora (2024), use Transformers to analyse input data (like text prompts) by breaking it down into \"tokens\" and then calculating the relevance between each token using self-attention, which helps the model understand the context and relationships within the data.Training\nMethods for stabilizing training\nThe plain transformer architecture had difficulty converging. In the original paper the authors recommended using learning rate warmup. That is, the learning rate should linearly scale up from 0 to maximal value for the first part of the training (usually recommended to be 2% of the total number of training steps), before decaying again.\nA 2020 paper found that using layer normalization before (instead of after) multiheaded attention and feedforward layers stabilizes training, not requiring learning rate warmup.Pretrain-finetune\nTransformers typically are first pretrained by self-supervised learning on a large generic dataset, followed by supervised fine-tuning on a small task-specific dataset. The pretrain dataset is typically an unlabeled large corpus, such as The Pile. Tasks for pretraining and fine-tuning commonly include:\n\nlanguage modeling\nnext-sentence prediction\nquestion answering\nreading comprehension\nsentiment analysis\nparaphrasing\nThe T5 transformer report documents a large number of natural language pretraining tasks. Some examples are:\n\nrestoring or repairing incomplete or corrupted text. For example, the input, \"Thank you\u202f~~\u202fme to your party\u202f~~\u202fweek\", might generate the output, \"Thank you for inviting me to your party last week\".\ntranslation between natural languages (machine translation)\njudging the pragmatic acceptability of natural language. For example, the following sentence might be judged \"not acceptable\", because even though it is syntactically well-formed, it is improbable in ordinary human usage: The course is jumping well.\nNote that while each of these tasks is trivial or obvious for human native speakers of the language (or languages), they have typically proved challenging for previous generations of machine learning architecture.Tasks\nIn general, there are 3 classes of language modelling tasks: \"masked\", \"autoregressive\", and \"prefixLM\". These classes are independent of a specific modeling architecture such as Transformer, but they are often discussed in the context of Transformer.\nIn a masked task, one or more of the tokens is masked out, and the model would produce a probability distribution predicting what the masked-out tokens are based on the context. The loss function for the task is typically sum of log-perplexities for the masked-out tokens: \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          Loss\n        \n        =\n        \u2212\n        \n          \u2211\n          \n            t\n            \u2208\n            \n              masked tokens\n            \n          \n        \n        ln\n        \u2061\n        (\n        \n          probability of \n        \n        t\n        \n           conditional on its context\n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\text{Loss}}=-\\sum _{t\\in {\\text{masked tokens}}}\\ln({\\text{probability of }}t{\\text{ conditional on its context}})}\n  \nand the model is trained to minimize this loss function. The BERT series of models are trained for masked token prediction and another task.\nIn an autoregressive task, the entire sequence is masked at first, and the model produces a probability distribution for the first token. Then the first token is revealed and the model predicts the second token, and so on. The loss function for the task is still typically the same. The GPT series of models are trained by autoregressive tasks.\nIn a prefixLM task, the sequence is divided into two parts. The first part is presented as context, and the model predicts the first token of the second part. Then that would be revealed, and the model predicts the second token, and so on. The loss function for the task is still typically the same. The T5 series of models are trained by prefixLM tasks.\nNote that \"masked\" as in \"masked language modelling\" is not \"masked\" as in \"masked attention\", and \"prefixLM\" (prefix language modeling) is not \"prefixLM\" (prefix language model).Architecture\nAll transformers have the same primary components:\n\nTokenizers, which convert text into tokens.\nEmbedding layer, which converts tokens and positions of the tokens into vector representations.\nTransformer layers, which carry out repeated transformations on the vector representations, extracting more and more linguistic information. These consist of alternating attention and feedforward layers. There are two major types of transformer layers: encoder layers and decoder layers, with further variants.\nUn-embedding layer, which converts the final vector representations back to a probability distribution over the tokens.\nThe following description follows exactly the Transformer as described in the original paper. There are variants, described in the following section.\nBy convention, we write all vectors as row vectors. This, for example, means that pushing a vector through a linear layer means multiplying it by a weight matrix on the right, as \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n        W\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle xW}\n  \n.Tokenization\nAs the Transformer architecture natively processes numerical data, not text, there must be a translation between text and tokens. A token is an integer that represents a character, or a short segment of characters. On the input side, the input text is parsed into a token sequence. Similarly, on the output side, the output tokens are parsed back to text. The module doing the conversion between texts and token sequences is a tokenizer.\nThe set of all tokens is the vocabulary of the tokenizer, and its size is the vocabulary size \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          n\n          \n            vocabulary\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n_{\\text{vocabulary}}}\n  \n. When faced with tokens outside the vocabulary, typically a special token is used, written as \"[UNK]\" for \"unknown\".\nSome commonly used tokenizers are byte pair encoding, WordPiece, and SentencePiece.Embedding\nEach token is converted into an embedding vector via a lookup table. Equivalently stated, it multiplies a one-hot representation of the token by an embedding matrix \n  \n    \n      \n        M\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle M}\n  \n.

This shall induce a bias towards the order of the input sequence, so that, for example, the input sequence \"man bites dog\" is processed differently from \"dog bites man\".\nThe positional encoding is defined as a function of type \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        :\n        \n          R\n        \n        \u2192\n        \n          \n            R\n          \n          \n            d\n          \n        \n        ;\n        d\n        \u2208\n        \n          Z\n        \n        ,\n        d\n        >\n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f:\\mathbb {R} \\to \\mathbb {R} ^{d};d\\in \\mathbb {Z} ,d>0}\n  \n, where \n  \n    \n      \n        d\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle d}\n  \n is a positive even integer.

This allows the transformer to take any encoded position and find a linear sum of the encoded locations of its neighbors. This sum of encoded positions, when fed into the attention mechanism, would create attention weights on its neighbors, much like what happens in a convolutional neural network language model. In the author's words, \"we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by relative position.\"\nIn typical implementations, all operations are done over the real numbers, not the complex numbers, but since complex multiplication can be implemented as real 2-by-2 matrix multiplication, this is a mere notational difference.Encoder-decoder (overview)\nLike earlier seq2seq models, the original transformer model used an encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder consists of encoding layers that process all the input tokens together one layer after another, while the decoder consists of decoding layers that iteratively process the encoder's output and the decoder's output tokens so far.\nThe purpose of each encoder layer is to create contextualized representations of the tokens, where each representation corresponds to a token that \"mixes\" information from other input tokens via self-attention mechanism. Each decoder layer contains two attention sublayers: (1) cross-attention for incorporating the output of encoder (contextualized input token representations), and (2) self-attention for \"mixing\" information among the input tokens to the decoder (i.e. the tokens generated so far during inference time).\nBoth the encoder and decoder layers have a feed-forward neural network for additional processing of their outputs and contain residual connections and layer normalization steps. These feed-forward layers contain most of the parameters in a Transformer model.Feedforward network\nThe feedforward network (FFN) modules in a Transformer are 2-layered multilayer perceptrons:\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          F\n          F\n          N\n        \n        (\n        x\n        )\n        =\n        \u03d5\n        (\n        x\n        \n          W\n          \n            (\n            1\n            )\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          b\n          \n            (\n            1\n            )\n          \n        \n        )\n        \n          W\n          \n            (\n            2\n            )\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          b\n          \n            (\n            2\n            )\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {FFN} (x)=\\phi (xW^{(1)}+b^{(1)})W^{(2)}+b^{(2)}}\n  \nwhere \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          W\n          \n            (\n            1\n            )\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle W^{(1)}}\n  \n and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          W\n          \n            (\n            2\n            )\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle W^{(2)}}\n  \n are weight matrices and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          b\n          \n            (\n            1\n            )\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle b^{(1)}}\n  \n and  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          b\n          \n            (\n            2\n            )\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle b^{(2)}}\n  \n are bias vectors, and \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03d5\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\phi }\n  \n is its activation function.

It is theoretically possible for all three to be different, but that is rarely the case in practice.Multiheaded attention\nOne set of \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          (\n          \n            \n              W\n              \n                Q\n              \n            \n            ,\n            \n              W\n              \n                K\n              \n            \n            ,\n            \n              W\n              \n                V\n              \n            \n          \n          )\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\left(W^{Q},W^{K},W^{V}\\right)}\n  \n matrices is called an attention head, and each layer in a transformer model has multiple attention heads. While each attention head attends to the tokens that are relevant to each token, multiple attention heads allow the model to do this for different definitions of \"relevance\". Specifically, the query and key projection matrices, \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          W\n          \n            Q\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle W^{Q}}\n  \n and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          W\n          \n            K\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle W^{K}}\n  \n , which are involved in the attention score computation, defines the \"relevance\". Meanwhile, the value projection matrix \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          W\n          \n            V\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle W^{V}}\n  \n, in combination with the part of the output projection matrix \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          W\n          \n            O\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle W^{O}}\n  \n, determines how the attended tokens influence what information is passed to subsequent layers and ultimately the output logits. In addition, the scope of attention, or the range of token relationships captured by each attention head, can expand as tokens pass through successive layers. This allows the model to capture more complex and long-range dependencies in deeper layers. Many transformer attention heads encode relevance relations that are meaningful to humans. For example, some attention heads can attend mostly to the next word, while others mainly attend from verbs to their direct objects. The computations for each attention head can be performed in parallel, which allows for fast processing. The outputs for the attention layer are concatenated to pass into the feed-forward neural network layers.\nConcretely, let the multiple attention heads be indexed by \n  \n    \n      \n        i\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i}\n  \n, then we have\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          MultiheadedAttention\n        \n        (\n        Q\n        ,\n        K\n        ,\n        V\n        )\n        =\n        \n          \n            Concat\n          \n          \n            i\n            \u2208\n            [\n            \n              n\n              \n                heads\n              \n            \n            ]\n          \n        \n        (\n        \n          Attention\n        \n        (\n        Q\n        \n          W\n          \n            i\n          \n          \n            Q\n          \n        \n        ,\n        K\n        \n          W\n          \n            i\n          \n          \n            K\n          \n        \n        ,\n        V\n        \n          W\n          \n            i\n          \n          \n            V\n          \n        \n        )\n        )\n        \n          W\n          \n            O\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\text{MultiheadedAttention}}(Q,K,V)={\\text{Concat}}_{i\\in [n_{\\text{heads}}]}({\\text{Attention}}(QW_{i}^{Q},KW_{i}^{K},VW_{i}^{V}))W^{O}}\n  \n where the matrix \n  \n    \n      \n        X\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle X}\n  \n is the concatenation of word embeddings, and the matrices \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          W\n          \n            i\n          \n          \n            Q\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          W\n          \n            i\n          \n          \n            K\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          W\n          \n            i\n          \n          \n            V\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle W_{i}^{Q},W_{i}^{K},W_{i}^{V}}\n  \n are \"projection matrices\" owned by individual attention head \n  \n    \n      \n        i\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i}\n  \n, and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          W\n          \n            O\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle W^{O}}\n  \n is a final projection matrix owned by the whole multi-headed attention head.\nIt is theoretically possible for each attention head to have a different head dimension \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          d\n          \n            head\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle d_{\\text{head}}}\n  \n, but that is rarely the case in practice.\nAs an example, in the smallest GPT-2 model, there are only self-attention mechanisms.

The first encoder layer takes the sequence of input vectors from the embedding layer, producing a sequence of vectors. This sequence of vectors is processed by the second encoder, and so on. The output from the final encoder layer is then used by the decoder.\nAs the encoder processes the entire input all at once, every token can attend to every other token (all-to-all attention), so there is no need for causal masking.Decoder\nA decoder consists of an embedding layer, followed by multiple decoder layers, followed by an un-embedding layer.\nEach decoder consists of three major components: a causally masked self-attention mechanism, a cross-attention mechanism, and a feed-forward neural network. The decoder functions in a similar fashion to the encoder, but an additional attention mechanism is inserted which instead draws relevant information from the encodings generated by the encoders. This mechanism can also be called the encoder-decoder attention.\nLike the first encoder, the first decoder takes positional information and embeddings of the output sequence as its input, rather than encodings. The transformer must not use the current or future output to predict an output, so the output sequence must be partially masked to prevent this reverse information flow. This allows for autoregressive text generation. For decoding, all-to-all attention is inappropriate, because a token cannot attend to tokens not yet generated. Thus, the self-attention module in the decoder is causally masked.\nIn contrast, the cross-attention mechanism attends to the output vectors of the encoder, which is computed before the decoder starts decoding. Consequently, there is no need for masking in the cross-attention mechanism.\nSchematically, we have:\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                \n                  H\n                  \u2032\n                \n              \n              \n                \n                =\n                \n                  MaskedMultiheadedAttention\n                \n                (\n                H\n                ,\n                H\n                ,\n                H\n                )\n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  DecoderLayer\n                \n                (\n                H\n                )\n              \n              \n                \n                =\n                \n                  FFN\n                \n                (\n                \n                  MultiheadedAttention\n                \n                (\n                \n                  H\n                  \u2032\n                \n                ,\n                \n                  H\n                  \n                    E\n                  \n                \n                ,\n                \n                  H\n                  \n                    E\n                  \n                \n                )\n                )\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\begin{aligned}H'&={\\text{MaskedMultiheadedAttention}}(H,H,H)\\\\{\\text{DecoderLayer}}(H)&={\\text{FFN}}({\\text{MultiheadedAttention}}(H',H^{E},H^{E}))\\end{aligned}}}\n  \nwhere \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          H\n          \n            E\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle H^{E}}\n  \n is the matrix with rows being the output vectors from the encoder.\nThe last decoder is followed by a final un-embedding layer. to produce the output probabilities over the vocabulary. Then, one of the tokens is sampled according to the probability, and the decoder can be run again to produce the next token, etc, autoregressively generating output text.Adapted architectures\nMany large language models, since they do not need to predict a whole new sequence from an input sequence, only use the encoder or decoder of the original transformer architecture. Early GPT models are decoder-only models trained to predict the next token in a sequence. BERT, another language model, only makes use of an encoder, and is trained to predict a randomly masked token in a sequence.Full transformer architecture\nSublayers\nEach encoder layer contains 2 sublayers: the self-attention and the feedforward network. Each decoder layer contains 3 sublayers: the causally masked self-attention, the cross-attention, and the feedforward network.\n\nThe final points of detail are the residual connections and layer normalization (LayerNorm, or LN), which while conceptually unnecessary, are necessary for numerical stability and convergence.  \nThe residual connection, which is introduced to avoid vanishing gradient issues and stabilize the training process, can be expressed as follows: y = F(x) + x. The expression indicates that an output y is the sum of the transformation of input x (F(x)) and the input itself (x). Adding the input x can preserve the input information and avoid issues when the gradient of F(x) is close to zero.  \nSimilarly to how the feedforward network modules are applied individually to each vector, the LayerNorm is also applied individually to each vector. \nThere are two common conventions in use: the post-LN and the pre-LN convention.

The pre-LN convention, proposed several times in 2018, was found to be easier to train, requiring no warm-up, leading to faster convergence.Pseudocode\nThe following is the pseudocode for a standard pre-LN encoder-decoder Transformer, adapted from\n\ninput: Encoder input t_e\n       Decoder input t_d\noutput: Array of probability distributions, with shape (decoder vocabulary size x length(decoder output sequence))\n\n/* encoder */\nz_e \u2190 encoder.tokenizer(t_e)\n\nfor each t in 1:length(z_e) do\n    z_e[t] \u2190 encoder.embedding(z_e[t]) + encoder.positional_embedding(t)\n\nfor each l in 1:length(encoder.layers) do\n    layer \u2190 encoder.layers[l]\n\n    /* first sublayer */\n    z_e_copy \u2190 copy(z_e)\n    for each t in 1:length(z_e) do\n        z_e[t] \u2190 layer.layer_norm(z_e[t])\n    z_e \u2190 layer.multiheaded_attention(z_e, z_e, z_e)\n    for each t in 1:length(z_e) do\n        z_e[t] \u2190 z_e[t] + z_e_copy[t]\n\n    /* second sublayer */\n    z_e_copy \u2190 copy(z_e)\n    for each t in 1:length(z_e) do\n        z_e[t] \u2190 layer.layer_norm(z_e[t])\n    z_e \u2190 layer.feedforward(z_e)\n    for each t in 1:length(z_e) do\n        z_e[t] \u2190 z_e[t] + z_e_copy[t]\n\nfor each t in 1:length(z_e) do\n    z_e[t] \u2190 encoder.final_layer_norm(z_e[t])\n\n/* decoder */\nz_d \u2190 decoder.tokenizer(t_d)\n\nfor each t in 1:length(z_d) do\n    z_d[t] \u2190 decoder.embedding(z_d[t]) + decoder.positional_embedding(t)\n\nfor each l in 1:length(decoder.layers) do\n        layer \u2190 decoder.layers[l]\n\n        /* first sublayer */\n        z_d_copy \u2190 copy(z_d)\n        for each t in 1:length(z_d) do\n            z_d[t] \u2190 layer.layer_norm(z_d[t])\n        z_d \u2190 layer.masked_multiheaded_attention(z_d, z_d, z_d)\n        for each t in 1:length(z_d) do\n            z_d[t] \u2190 z_d[t] + z_d_copy[t]\n\n        /* second sublayer */\n        z_d_copy \u2190 copy(z_d)\n        for each t in 1:length(z_d) do\n            z_d[t] \u2190 layer.layer_norm(z_d[t])\n        z_d \u2190 layer.multiheaded_attention(z_d, z_e, z_e) \n        for each i in 1:length(z_d) do\n            z_d[t] \u2190 z_d[t] + z_d_copy[t]\n\n        /* third sublayer */\n        z_d_copy \u2190 copy(z_d)\n        for each t in 1:length(z_d) do\n            z_d[t] \u2190 layer.layer_norm(z_d[t])\n        z_d \u2190 layer.feedforward(z_d)\n        for each t in 1:length(z_d) do\n            z_d[t] \u2190 z_d[t] + z_d_copy[t]\n\nz_d \u2190 decoder.final_layer_norm(z_d)\n\noutput_distributions \u2190 []\nfor each t in 1:length(z_d) do\n    output_distributions.append(decoder.unembed(z_d[t]))\n\nreturn output_distributionsTerminology\nThe Transformer architecture, being modular, allows variations. Several common variations are described here.\nAn \"encoder-only\" Transformer applies the encoder to map an input text into a sequence of vectors that represent the input text. This is usually used for text embedding and representation learning for downstream applications. BERT is encoder-only. They are less often used currently, as they were found to be not significantly better than training an encoder-decoder Transformer, then taking just the encoder.\nA \"decoder-only\" Transformer is not literally decoder-only, since without an encoder, the cross-attention mechanism has nothing to attend to. Thus, the decoder layers in a decoder-only Transformer is composed of just two sublayers: the causally masked self-attention, and the feedforward network. This is usually used for text generation and instruction following. The models in the GPT series and Chinchilla series are decoder-only.\nAn \"encoder-decoder\" Transformer is generally the same as the original Transformer, with 2 sublayers per encoder layer and 3 sublayers per decoder layer, etc. They might have minor architectural improvements, such as alternative activation functions, changing the location of normalization, etc. This is also usually used for text generation and instruction following. The models in the T5 series are encoder-decoder.\nA \"prefixLM\" (prefix language model) is a decoder-only architecture, but with prefix masking, which is different from causal masking. Specifically, it has mask of the form:\u200aFigure 3\u200a\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          M\n          \n            prefixLM\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            [\n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    0\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \u2212\n                  \u221e\n                \n              \n              \n                \n                  \n                    0\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    M\n                    \n                      causal\n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n            ]\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle M_{\\text{prefixLM}}={\\begin{bmatrix}\\mathbf {0} &-\\infty \\\\\\mathbf {0} &M_{\\text{causal}}\\end{bmatrix}}}\n  \nwhere the first columns correspond to the \"prefix\", and the subsequent columns correspond to the autoregressively generated text based on the prefix. They resemble encoder-decoder models, but has less \"sparsity\". Such models are rarely used, though they are cited as theoretical possibilities and benchmarked comparisons.\nThere are also mixed seq2seq models. For example, in 2020, Google Translate replaced the previous RNN-encoder\u2013RNN-decoder model by a Transformer-encoder\u2013RNN-decoder model, on the argument that an RNN-decoder runs much faster than Transformer-decoder when run autoregressively.Subsequent work\nAlternative activation functions\nThe original transformer uses ReLU activation function. Other activation functions were developed. The Llama series and PaLM used SwiGLU; both GPT-1 and BERT used GELU. \nAlternative activation functions are often used in combination with Gated Linear Units in the feedforward module.Alternative normalizations\nThe normalization used in the Transformer can be different from LayerNorm. One example is RMSNorm which is used in the Llama series. Other examples include CapsuleNorm ScaleNorm, or FixNorm.Alternative positional encodings\nTransformers may use other positional encoding methods than sinusoidal. \nThe original Transformer paper reported using a learned positional encoding, but finding it not superior to the sinusoidal one. Later,  found that causal masking itself provides enough signal to a Transformer decoder that it can learn to implicitly perform absolute positional encoding without the positional encoding module.RoPE\nRoPE (rotary positional embedding), is best explained by considering a list of 2-dimensional vectors \n  \n    \n      \n        [\n        (\n        \n          x\n          \n            1\n          \n          \n            (\n            1\n            )\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          x\n          \n            1\n          \n          \n            (\n            2\n            )\n          \n        \n        )\n        ,\n        (\n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n          \n            (\n            1\n            )\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n          \n            (\n            2\n            )\n          \n        \n        )\n        ,\n        (\n        \n          x\n          \n            3\n          \n          \n            (\n            1\n            )\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          x\n          \n            3\n          \n          \n            (\n            2\n            )\n          \n        \n        )\n        ,\n        .\n        .\n        .\n        ]\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle [(x_{1}^{(1)},x_{1}^{(2)}),(x_{2}^{(1)},x_{2}^{(2)}),(x_{3}^{(1)},x_{3}^{(2)}),...]}\n  \n.

Since it is directly plugged into the attention mechanism, it can be combined with any positional encoder that is plugged into the \"bottom\" of the entire network (which is where the sinusoidal encoder on the original transformer, as well as RoPE and many others, are located).Relative Position Encodings\nRelative Position Encodings is similar to ALiBi, but more generic:\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                \n                  Attention\n                \n                (\n                Q\n                ,\n                K\n                ,\n                V\n                )\n                =\n                \n                  softmax\n                \n                \n                  (\n                  \n                    \n                      \n                        \n                          Q\n                          \n                            K\n                            \n                              \n                                T\n                              \n                            \n                          \n                        \n                        \n                          \n                            d\n                            \n                              k\n                            \n                          \n                        \n                      \n                    \n                    +\n                    B\n                  \n                  )\n                \n                V\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\begin{aligned}{\\text{Attention}}(Q,K,V)={\\text{softmax}}\\left({\\frac {QK^{\\mathrm {T} }}{\\sqrt {d_{k}}}}+B\\right)V\\end{aligned}}}\n  \nwhere \n  \n    \n      \n        B\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle B}\n  \n is a Toeplitz matrix, that is, \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          B\n          \n            i\n            ,\n            j\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          B\n          \n            \n              i\n              \u2032\n            \n            ,\n            \n              j\n              \u2032\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle B_{i,j}=B_{i',j'}}\n  \n whenever \n  \n    \n      \n        i\n        \u2212\n        j\n        =\n        \n          i\n          \u2032\n        \n        \u2212\n        \n          j\n          \u2032\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i-j=i'-j'}\n  \n. This is contrasted with the original sinusoidal positional encoding, which is an \"absolute positional encoding\".Efficient implementation\nThe transformer model has been implemented in standard deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch. Transformers is a library produced by Hugging Face that supplies transformer-based architectures and pretrained models.KV caching\nWhen an autoregressive transformer is used for inference, such as generating text, the query vector is different at each step, but the already-computed key and value vectors are always the same. The KV caching method saves the computed key and value vectors at each attention block, so that they are not recomputed at each new token. PagedAttention applies memory paging to KV caching.\nIf a transformer is used with a baked-in prompt, such as [\"You are a customer support agent...\"], then the key and value vectors can be computed for the prompt, and saved on disk. The saving in compute is significant when the model is used for many short interactions, such as in online chatbots.FlashAttention\nFlashAttention is an algorithm that implements the transformer attention mechanism efficiently on a GPU. It is a communication-avoiding algorithm that performs matrix multiplications in blocks, such that each block fits within the cache of a GPU, and by careful management of the blocks it minimizes data copying between GPU caches (as data movement is slow). See the page on softmax for details.\nAn improved version, FlashAttention-2, was developed to cater to the rising demand for language models capable of handling longer context lengths. It offers enhancements in work partitioning and parallelism, enabling it to achieve up to 230 TFLOPs/s on A100 GPUs (FP16/BF16), a 2x speed increase over the original FlashAttention.\nKey advancements in FlashAttention-2 include the reduction of non-matmul FLOPs, improved parallelism over the sequence length dimension, better work partitioning between GPU warps, and added support for head dimensions up to 256 and multi-query attention (MQA) and grouped-query attention (GQA).\nBenchmarks revealed FlashAttention-2 to be up to 2x faster than FlashAttention and up to 9x faster than a standard attention implementation in PyTorch. Future developments include optimization for new hardware like H100 GPUs and new data types like FP8.Multi-Query Attention\nMulti-Query Attention changes the multiheaded attention mechanism.

MQA is GQA with one group, while standard multiheaded attention is GQA with the maximal number of groups.\n\nMultihead Latent Attention (MLA) is a low-rank approximation to standard MHA. Specifically, each hidden vector, before entering the attention mechanism, is first projected to two low-dimensional spaces (\"latent space\"), one for query and one for key-value (KV vector). This design minimizes the KV cache, as only the low-dimensional KV vector needs to be cached.Speculative decoding\nSpeculative decoding is a method to accelerate token decoding. Similarly to speculative execution in CPUs, future tokens are computed quickly, then verified. If the quickly computed tokens are incorrect, they are discarded and computed slowly.\nThe key factor in speculative decoding is that a Transformer decoder can verify faster than it can decode, in the following sense.\nSuppose we have two transformer models like GPT-3 and GPT-3-small, both with a context window size of 512. To generate an entire context window autoregressively with greedy decoding with GPT-3, it must be run for 512 times, each time generating a token \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          x\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        ,\n        .\n        .\n        .\n        ,\n        \n          x\n          \n            512\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{512}}\n  \n, taking time \n  \n    \n      \n        512\n        \n          T\n          \n            GPT-3\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 512T_{\\text{GPT-3}}}\n  \n. However, if we had some educated guess for the values of these tokens, we could verify all of them in parallel, in one run of the model, by checking that each \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          x\n          \n            t\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x_{t}}\n  \n is indeed the token with the largest log-likelihood in the \n  \n    \n      \n        t\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle t}\n  \n-th output.\nIn speculative decoding, a smaller model or some other simple heuristic is used to generate a few speculative tokens that are subsequently verified by the larger model. For example, suppose we use GPT-3-small to generate four speculative tokens: \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                x\n                ~\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          \n            \n              \n                x\n                ~\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          \n            \n              \n                x\n                ~\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            3\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          \n            \n              \n                x\n                ~\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            4\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\tilde {x}}_{1},{\\tilde {x}}_{2},{\\tilde {x}}_{3},{\\tilde {x}}_{4}}\n  \n.

However, that vector can then be further processed by another Transformer block to predict the next token, and so on for arbitrarily many steps into the future. This trades off accuracy for speed, since each new token costs just one more Transformer block, rather than the entire stack.Sub-quadratic transformers\nTraining transformer-based architectures can be expensive, especially for long inputs. Many methods have been developed to attempt to address the issue. In the image domain, Swin Transformer is an efficient architecture that performs attention inside shifting windows. In the audio domain, SepTr decouples the attention in time and frequency domains. Long Range Arena (2020) is a standard benchmark for comparing the behavior of transformer architectures over long inputs.Alternative attention graphs\nThe standard attention graph is either all-to-all or causal, both of which scales as \n  \n    \n      \n        O\n        (\n        \n          N\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle O(N^{2})}\n  \n where \n  \n    \n      \n        N\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle N}\n  \n is the number of tokens in a sequence.\nReformer (2020) reduces the computational load from \n  \n    \n      \n        O\n        (\n        \n          N\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle O(N^{2})}\n  \n to \n  \n    \n      \n        O\n        (\n        N\n        ln\n        \u2061\n        N\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle O(N\\ln N)}\n  \n by using locality-sensitive hashing and reversible layers. \nSparse attention uses attention graphs that grows slower than \n  \n    \n      \n        O\n        (\n        \n          N\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle O(N^{2})}\n  \n. For example, BigBird (2020) uses random small-world networks which grows as \n  \n    \n      \n        O\n        (\n        N\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle O(N)}\n  \n.\nOrdinary transformers require a memory size that is quadratic in the size of the context window. Attention-free transformers reduce this to a linear dependence while still retaining the advantages of a transformer by linking the key to the value.Random Feature Attention\nRandom Feature Attention (2021) uses Fourier random features:\n  \n    \n      \n        \u03c6\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        =\n        \n          \n            1\n            \n              D\n            \n          \n        \n        [\n        cos\n        \u2061\n        \u27e8\n        \n          w\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        x\n        \u27e9\n        ,\n        sin\n        \u2061\n        \u27e8\n        \n          w\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        x\n        \u27e9\n        ,\n        \u22ef\n        cos\n        \u2061\n        \u27e8\n        \n          w\n          \n            D\n          \n        \n        ,\n        x\n        \u27e9\n        ,\n        sin\n        \u2061\n        \u27e8\n        \n          w\n          \n            D\n          \n        \n        ,\n        x\n        \u27e9\n        \n          ]\n          \n            T\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\varphi (x)={\\frac {1}{\\sqrt {D}}}[\\cos \\langle w_{1},x\\rangle ,\\sin \\langle w_{1},x\\rangle ,\\cdots \\cos \\langle w_{D},x\\rangle ,\\sin \\langle w_{D},x\\rangle ]^{T}}\n  \nwhere \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          w\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        .\n        .\n        .\n        ,\n        \n          w\n          \n            D\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle w_{1},...,w_{D}}\n  \n are independent samples from the normal distribution \n  \n    \n      \n        N\n        (\n        0\n        ,\n        \n          \u03c3\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        I\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle N(0,\\sigma ^{2}I)}\n  \n.

A 2022 study found that Transformers pretrained only on natural language can be finetuned on only 0.03% of parameters and become competitive with LSTMs on a variety of logical and visual tasks, demonstrating transfer learning. The LLaVA was a vision-language model composed of a language model (Vicuna-13B) and a vision model (ViT-L/14), connected by a linear layer. Only the linear layer is finetuned.\nVision transformers adapt the transformer to computer vision by breaking down input images as a series of patches, turning them into vectors, and treating them like tokens in a standard transformer.\nConformer and later Whisper follow the same pattern for speech recognition, first turning the speech signal into a spectrogram, which is then treated like an image, i.e. broken down into a series of patches, turned into vectors and treated like tokens in a standard transformer.\nPerceivers are a variant of Transformers designed for multimodality.\nFor image generation, notable architectures are DALL-E 1 (2021), Parti (2022), Phenaki (2023), and Muse (2023). Unlike later models, DALL-E is not a diffusion model. Instead, it uses a decoder-only Transformer that autoregressively generates a text, followed by the token representation of an image, which is then converted by a variational autoencoder to an image. Parti is an encoder-decoder Transformer, where the encoder processes a text prompt, and the decoder generates a token representation of an image. Muse is an encoder-only Transformer that is trained to predict masked image tokens from unmasked image tokens. During generation, all input tokens are masked, and the highest-confidence predictions are included for the next iteration, until all tokens are predicted. Phenaki is a text-to-video model. It is a bidirectional masked transformer conditioned on pre-computed text tokens. The generated tokens are then decoded to a video.Applications\nThe transformer has had great success in natural language processing (NLP). Many large language models such as GPT-2, GPT-3, GPT-4, Gemini, AlbertAGPT, Claude, BERT, Grok, XLNet, RoBERTa and ChatGPT demonstrate the ability of transformers to perform a wide variety of NLP-related subtasks and their related real-world applications, including:\n\nmachine translation\ntime series prediction\ndocument summarization\ndocument generation\nnamed entity recognition (NER)\nwriting computer code based on requirements expressed in natural language.\nspeech-to-text\nBeyond traditional NLP, the transformer architecture has had success in other applications, such as:\n\nbiological sequence analysis\nvideo understanding\nprotein folding (such as AlphaFold)\nevaluating chess board positions. Using static evaluation alone (that is, with no Minimax search) transformer achieved an Elo of 2895, putting it at grandmaster level.See also\nseq2seq \u2013 Family of machine learning approaches\nPerceiver \u2013 Variant of Transformer designed for multimodal data\nVision transformer \u2013 Machine learning model for vision processing\nLarge language model \u2013 Type of machine learning model\nBERT (language model) \u2013 Series of language models developed by Google AI\nGenerative pre-trained transformer \u2013 Type of large language model\nT5 (language model) \u2013 Series of large language models developed by Google AINotes\nReferences\n== Further reading ==", "result": "# Transformer (deep learning architecture)\n\nIn deep learning, the transformer is a deep-learning architecture introduced in the 2017 paper \"Attention Is All You Need\" by researchers at Google Brain. It serves as a breakthrough in machine translation, demonstrating that an architecture based solely on attention mechanisms can match or exceed the performance of traditional phrase-based machine translation systems.\n\nThe transformer improves on the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) architecture by adding a novel mechanism called attention, which allows the model to focus on different parts of the input when generating each part of the output. The transformer is a significant advancement over prior recurrent neural network (RNN)-based architectures, such as long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, which are less efficient at processing long sequences. Additionally, unlike RNNs, the transformer can attend to different positions in the input sequence in parallel, making it much faster to train and deploy.\n\nThe transformer has since become the de facto backbone architecture for many deep learning tasks involving sequences, especially in natural language processing (NLP). Its success led to widespread adoption of the transformer in large language models (LLMs) such as BERT, GPT, T5, and ChatGPT. The architecture has also been adapted for other purposes, such as computer vision, time series forecasting, and reinforcement learning.\n\nHistory\n\nThe transformer model was introduced in the 2017 paper \"Attention Is All You Need\" by researchers at Google Brain. The paper demonstrated that a neural network based entirely on attention mechanisms could achieve state-of-the-art results on several tasks, including machine translation.\n\nAttention mechanisms had been a promising area of research in deep learning for several years, with early work such as the additive attention mechanism for neural machine translation (NMT) by Bahdanau et al. in 2015. However, these early approaches were limited in their ability to scale to long sequences and were often combined with other architectures, such as LSTMs.\n\nThe transformer addressed these limitations by using a self-attention mechanism that allowed the model to weigh the importance of different parts of the input sequence when generating each part of the output sequence. This eliminated the need for recurrence or convolution, allowing the model to process entire sequences in parallel.\n\nSince its introduction, the transformer has become one of the most widely used deep learning architectures. Its success has inspired numerous variations and extensions, such as the transformer encoder-decoder architecture for machine translation and the transformer-based BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model for NLP. The transformer has also been adapted for other tasks, such as image processing and time series forecasting.\n\n Predecessors\n\n--- Sequence modeling\n\nBefore the transformer, recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and particularly LSTMs, were the dominant approach for modeling sequences. RNNs process sequences in a sequential manner, with each output being fed back into the network along with the next input. LSTMs are a type of RNN that use gating mechanisms to better preserve information over longer sequences.\n\nHowever, LSTMs have several limitations. They can be difficult to train, requiring careful initialization and often taking a long time to converge. They are also less efficient than other architectures, as the recurrent nature of the model requires processing sequences sequentially. Finally, LSTMs do not scale well to long sequences, as the recurrence can lead to either vanishing or exploding gradients.\n\n--- Attention with seq2seq\n\nAttention mechanisms were originally introduced in the sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) architecture for machine translation by Luong et al. in 2015. The seq2seq architecture consists of an encoder-decoder architecture where the encoder produces a fixed-length representation of the input sequence, which is then decoded into the output sequence. The attention mechanism allows the decoder to focus on different parts of the input sequence when generating each part of the output sequence.\n\nThe attention mechanism computes a weighted sum of the encoder's hidden states, with the weights determined by the similarity between the decoder's current state and the encoder's hidden states. This allows the decoder to dynamically focus on different parts of the input sequence as it generates the output sequence, improving the model's ability to handle long sequences and capture complex relationships between input and output tokens.\n\nAttention mechanisms proved to be a powerful addition to the seq2seq architecture, improving performance on machine translation tasks. This led to a flurry of research into different attention mechanisms and their applications to other sequence modeling tasks.\n\nAttention with seq2seq\n\nAttention mechanisms were originally introduced in the sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) architecture for machine translation by Luong et al. in 2015.

This led to a flurry of research into different attention mechanisms and their applications to other sequence modeling tasks.\n\n Parallelizing attention\n\nWhile attention mechanisms proved to be powerful, they were also computationally expensive and difficult to parallelize. This made them impractical for use in large-scale models or for tasks with long sequences.\n\nThe transformer addressed these limitations by using a self-attention mechanism that allowed the model to weigh the importance of different parts of the input sequence when generating each part of the output sequence. This eliminated the need for recurrence or convolution, allowing the model to process entire sequences in parallel.\n\nIn addition to the self-attention mechanism, the transformer also introduced a feed-forward network with residual connections and layer normalization, which improved the model's ability to learn and converge more quickly.\n\nThe success of the transformer in machine translation and other tasks led to a proliferation of variations and extensions to the basic architecture. These include the use of multi-head attention, which allows the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence using multiple attention mechanisms simultaneously; the use of position-wise feed-forward networks, which allow the model to process different parts of the input sequence in parallel; and the use of causal masking, which prevents the model from attending to future tokens during decoding.\n\nDespite these advances, the transformer still had limitations. It was still relatively computationally expensive, making it difficult to use in resource-constrained settings. It was also difficult to parallelize, limiting its scalability to very large models or long sequences.\n\n Feedforward network\n\nThe feedforward network in the transformer architecture is a key component that enables the model to learn complex non-linear transformations of the input and output sequences. In the original transformer model, the feedforward network is composed of two fully connected layers with a non-linear activation function in between.\n\nThe feedforward network takes the output of the multi-head self-attention mechanism and applies a series of linear transformations to it. Specifically, the input to the feedforward network is first transformed using a weight matrix $W^{(1)}$ and a bias vector $b^{(1)}$, producing a new output:\n\n    $y_1 = \\text{ReLU}(xW^{(1)} + b^{(1)})$\n\nwhere $\\text{ReLU}$ is the rectified linear unit activation function. The output of the first linear transformation is then passed through another linear transformation, using a weight matrix $W^{(2)}$ and a bias vector $b^{(2)}$, to produce the final output of the feedforward network:\n\n    $y_2 = y_1 W^{(2)} + b^{(2)}$\n\nThe feedforward network is applied separately to each position in the sequence, allowing the model to learn complex non-linear relationships between the input and output sequences. The use of the ReLU activation function introduces non-linearity to the model, enabling it to learn complex patterns in the data.\n\nThe feedforward network is an important component of the transformer architecture because it allows the model to learn complex transformations of the input and output sequences. By applying a series of linear transformations and non-linear activations, the feedforward network enables the model to capture complex relationships between the input and output sequences, leading to improved performance on a variety of tasks.\n\n Scaled dot-product attention\n\nThe scaled dot-product attention is a key component of the transformer architecture that allows the model to weigh the importance of different parts of the input sequence when generating each part of the output sequence. It is based on the dot-product attention mechanism introduced in the original attention paper by Bahdanau et al. in 2015, but with a scaling factor added to improve training stability.\n\nThe scaled dot-product attention takes three input vectors: the query vector $Q$, the key vector $K$, and the value vector $V$. The attention scores are computed as the dot product of the query vector with the transpose of the key vector, scaled by the square root of the key vector's dimensionality $d_k$:\n\n    $\\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \\text{softmax}\\left(\\frac{QK^{\\top}}{\\sqrt{d_k}}\\right)V$\n\nThe softmax function is then applied to the attention scores to obtain a probability distribution over the input sequence, which is then used to weigh the corresponding values. This allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence when generating each part of the output sequence.\n\nThe scaled dot-product attention mechanism is a powerful tool for capturing complex relationships between input and output sequences. By weighing the importance of different parts of the input sequence, the attention mechanism allows the model to dynamically focus on the most relevant parts of the input as it generates the output sequence. This makes it possible to handle long sequences and capture complex relationships between input and output tokens.\n\n Attention head\n\nThe attention head is a key component of the transformer architecture that allows the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence when generating each part of the output sequence. It is based on the attention mechanism introduced in the original attention paper by Bahdanau et al. in 2015.\n\nThe attention head takes three input vectors: the query vector $Q$, the key vector $K$, and the value vector $V$. The attention scores are computed as the dot product of the query vector with the transpose of the key vector, scaled by the square root of the key vector's dimensionality $d_k$:\n\n    $\\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \\text{softmax}\\left(\\frac{QK^{\\top}}{\\sqrt{d_k}}\\right)V$\n\nThe softmax function is then applied to the attention scores to obtain a probability distribution over the input sequence, which is then used to weigh the corresponding values. This allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence when generating each part of the output sequence.\n\nThe attention head is a powerful tool for capturing complex relationships between input and output sequences. By weighing the importance of different parts of the input sequence, the attention head allows the model to dynamically focus on the most relevant parts of the input as it generates the output sequence. This makes it possible to handle long sequences and capture complex relationships between input and output tokens.\n\n Multiheaded attention\n\nThe multiheaded attention is an extension of the attention head that allows the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence using multiple attention heads simultaneously. It is based on the idea of multihead attention introduced in the original transformer paper by Vaswani et al. in 2017.\n\nThe multiheaded attention takes three input vectors: the query vector $Q$, the key vector $K$, and the value vector $V$. The input vectors are first transformed into multiple sets of query, key, and value vectors using multiple weight matrices, one for each attention head. Specifically, let $h$ denote the number of attention heads, and $d_h$ denote the dimensionality of each attention head. Then, the input vectors are transformed into $h$ sets of query, key, and value vectors as follows:\n\n    $Q_i = W_Q^i X, K_i = W_K^i X, V_i = W_V^i X, i = 1, ..., h$\n\nwhere $W_Q^i$, $W_K^i$, and $W_V^i$ are the weight matrices for the $i$-th attention head, and $X$ is the input sequence.\n\nFor each attention head $i$, the attention scores are computed as the dot product of the query vector $Q_i$ with the transpose of the key vector $K_i$, scaled by the square root of the key vector's dimensionality $d_k$:\n\n    $\\text{Attention}_i(Q_i, K_i, V_i) = \\text{softmax}\\left(\\frac{Q_iK_i^{\\top}}{\\sqrt{d_k}}\\right)V_i$\n\nThe outputs of the attention heads are then concatenated along the feature dimension and transformed using another weight matrix to produce the final output of the multiheaded attention:\n\n    $\\text{MultiHead}(Q, K, V) = \\text{Concat}(Attention_1(Q_1, K_1, V_1), ..., Attention_h(Q_h, K_h, V_h)) W^O$\n\nwhere $\\text{Concat}$ denotes the concatenation operation along the feature dimension, and $W^O$ is the output transformation weight matrix.\n\nThe multiheaded attention allows the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence using multiple attention heads simultaneously. Each attention head learns to attend to different parts of the input sequence, and the outputs of the attention heads are combined using a linear transformation to produce the final output. This allows the model to capture different aspects of the input sequence simultaneously, improving its ability to handle complex relationships between input and output sequences.\n\n Masked attention\n\nThe masked attention is a variant of the attention mechanism that is used in the decoder of the transformer architecture to prevent the model from attending to future tokens during decoding. It is based on the idea of causal masking introduced in the original transformer paper by Vaswani et al. in 2017.\n\nThe masked attention takes three input vectors: the query vector $Q$, the key vector $K$, and the value vector $V$. The attention scores are computed as the dot product of the query vector with the transpose of the key vector, scaled by the square root of the key vector's dimensionality $d_k$:\n\n    $\\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \\text{softmax}\\left(\\frac{QK^{\\top}}{\\sqrt{d_k}}\\right)V$\n\nHowever, to prevent the model from attending to future tokens during decoding, a mask matrix $M$ is applied to the attention scores before the softmax function is applied. The mask matrix is a lower triangular matrix with zeros on the diagonal, indicating that the model should not attend to future tokens:\n\n    $M = \\begin{pmatrix}\n    1 & 0 & 0 & \\cdots & 0\\\\\n    1 & 1 & 0 & \\cdots & 0\\\\\n    1 & 1 & 1 & \\cdots & 0\\\\\n    \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots\\\\\n    1 & 1 & 1 & \\cdots & 1\n    \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe masked attention scores are obtained by element-wise multiplication of the attention scores and the mask matrix:\n\n    $\\text{MaskedAttention}(Q, K, V) = \\text{softmax}(MK^{\\top})V$\n\nThe masked attention mechanism is a powerful tool for preventing the model from attending to future tokens during decoding. By applying a mask matrix to the attention scores, the model is forced to attend only to the tokens that have already been generated, ensuring that the output sequence is generated in a causal manner.\n\n Encoder\n\nThe encoder is the first half of the transformer architecture that processes the input sequence and produces a contextualized representation of the input tokens. It consists of a stack of $N$ identical layers, each of which contains two sub-layers: a multi-headed self-attention layer and a position-wise fully connected feed-forward network.\n\nThe multi-headed self-attention layer allows the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence and capture complex relationships between the input tokens. The attention scores are computed using the query, key, and value vectors, which are derived from the input tokens using three separate weight matrices. The output of the multi-headed self-attention layer is then passed through a linear transformation to produce the final output.\n\nThe position-wise fully connected feed-forward network allows the model to learn complex non-linear transformations of the input tokens. It consists of two fully connected layers with a ReLU activation function in between. The input to the feed-forward network is first transformed using a weight matrix and a bias vector, producing a new output. The output of the first linear transformation is then passed through the ReLU activation function and another linear transformation, using a weight matrix and a bias vector, to produce the final output of the feed-forward network.\n\nThe output of the position-wise fully connected feed-forward network is then added to the output of the multi-headed self-attention layer, and the result is normalized using layer normalization. This adds residual connections to the encoder, allowing the model to learn more complex transformations of the input sequence while preserving the original input.\n\nThe encoder is a key component of the transformer architecture because it allows the model to learn complex representations of the input sequence. By using multi-headed self-attention and position-wise fully connected feed-forward networks, the encoder is able to capture complex relationships between the input tokens and produce a rich contextualized representation of the input sequence.\n\n Decoder\n\nThe decoder is the second half of the transformer architecture that generates the output sequence based on the contextualized representation of the input sequence produced by the encoder. It consists of a stack of $N$ identical layers, each of which contains three sub-layers: a masked multi-headed self-attention layer, a multi-headed attention layer, and a position-wise fully connected feed-forward network.\n\nThe masked multi-headed self-attention layer allows the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence and capture complex relationships between the input tokens. Unlike the encoder's multi-headed self-attention layer, the masked multi-headed self-attention layer uses a mask matrix to prevent the model from attending to future tokens during decoding. The attention scores are computed using the query, key, and value vectors, which are derived from the input tokens using three separate weight matrices. The output of the masked multi-headed self-attention layer is then passed through a linear transformation to produce the final output.\n\nThe multi-headed attention layer allows the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence and capture complex relationships between the input and output tokens. The attention scores are computed using the query, key, and value vectors, which are derived from the input tokens and the encoder's output using three separate weight matrices. The output of the multi-headed attention layer is then passed through a linear transformation to produce the final output.\n\nThe position-wise fully connected feed-forward network allows the model to learn complex non-linear transformations of the input tokens. It consists of two fully connected layers with a ReLU activation function in between. The input to the feed-forward network is first transformed using a weight matrix and a bias vector, producing a new output.

This adds residual connections to the decoder, allowing the model to learn more complex transformations of the input sequence while preserving the original input.\n\nThe output of the decoder is then passed through a linear transformation and a softmax activation function to produce the probabilities of each token in the output vocabulary. The token with the highest probability is then selected as the next token in the output sequence, and the process is repeated until the end of the sequence is reached.\n\nThe decoder is a key component of the transformer architecture because it allows the model to generate the output sequence based on the contextualized representation of the input sequence produced by the encoder. By using masked multi-headed self-attention, multi-headed attention, and position-wise fully connected feed-forward networks, the decoder is able to capture complex relationships between the input and output tokens and generate a coherent output sequence.\n\n Adapted architectures\n\n--- Decoder-only\n\nSome transformer models, such as early GPT models, only use the decoder part of the architecture. These models do not have an encoder and instead rely on a large amount of self-supervised pretraining data to learn useful representations of text.\n\n--- Encoder-only\n\nOther transformer models, such as BERT, use only the encoder part of the architecture. These models are bidirectional, meaning they can process text in both directions, and are trained on a variety of NLP tasks.\n\n--- Both\n\nMost modern transformer models, such as GPT-3 and T5, use both the encoder and decoder parts of the architecture. These models can process text in both directions and are trained on a wide range of NLP tasks.\n\n Full transformer architecture\n\nThe full transformer architecture consists of an encoder and a decoder, both of which use the self-attention and feed-forward network components described above. The encoder takes a sequence of input tokens and produces a sequence of contextualized representations, while the decoder takes a sequence of output tokens and produces a sequence of predicted output tokens.\n\nThe encoder and decoder are connected via an attention mechanism that allows the decoder to attend to different parts of the encoder's output when generating each part of the output sequence. This allows the model to capture complex relationships between the input and output sequences and generate a coherent output sequence.\n\nThe full transformer architecture is a powerful tool for natural language processing tasks such as machine translation, text summarization, and question answering. By using self-attention and feed-forward networks, the architecture is able to capture complex relationships between input and output sequences and produce high-quality output sequences.\n\n Sublayers\n\nThe transformer architecture consists of several sublayers that work together to process input sequences and generate output sequences. Each sublayer performs a specific task and is composed of multiple components.\n\n--- Encoder\n\nThe encoder consists of a stack of $N$ identical layers, each of which contains two sublayers: a multi-headed self-attention sublayer and a position-wise fully connected feed-forward network sublayer.\n\nThe multi-headed self-attention sublayer allows the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence and capture complex relationships between the input tokens. The attention scores are computed using the query, key, and value vectors, which are derived from the input tokens using three separate weight matrices. The output of the multi-headed self-attention sublayer is then passed through a linear transformation to produce the final output.\n\nThe position-wise fully connected feed-forward network sublayer allows the model to learn complex non-linear transformations of the input tokens. It consists of two fully connected layers with a ReLU activation function in between. The input to the feed-forward network is first transformed using a weight matrix and a bias vector, producing a new output. The output of the first linear transformation is then passed through the ReLU activation function and another linear transformation, using a weight matrix and a bias vector, to produce the final output of the feed-forward network.\n\nThe output of the position-wise fully connected feed-forward network sublayer is then added to the output of the multi-headed self-attention sublayer, and the result is normalized using layer normalization. This adds residual connections to the encoder, allowing the model to learn more complex transformations of the input sequence while preserving the original input.\n\n--- Decoder\n\nThe decoder consists of a stack of $N$ identical layers, each of which contains three sublayers: a masked multi-headed self-attention sublayer, a multi-headed attention sublayer, and a position-wise fully connected feed-forward network sublayer.\n\nThe masked multi-headed self-attention sublayer allows the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence and capture complex relationships between the input tokens. Unlike the encoder's multi-headed self-attention sublayer, the masked multi-headed self-attention sublayer uses a mask matrix to prevent the model from attending to future tokens during decoding. The attention scores are computed using the query, key, and value vectors, which are derived from the input tokens using three separate weight matrices.

The attention scores are computed using the query, key, and value vectors, which are derived from the input tokens and the encoder's output using three separate weight matrices. The output of the multi-headed attention sublayer is then passed through a linear transformation to produce the final output.\n\nThe position-wise fully connected feed-forward network sublayer allows the model to learn complex non-linear transformations of the input tokens. It consists of two fully connected layers with a ReLU activation function in between. The input to the feed-forward network is first transformed using a weight matrix and a bias vector, producing a new output.

This adds residual connections to the decoder, allowing the model to learn more complex transformations of the input sequence while preserving the original input.\n\n--- Positional encoding\n\nThe positional encoding sublayer is used to add information about the position of each token in the input sequence to the model. This is necessary because the transformer architecture does not have built-in knowledge of the order of the tokens in the sequence. The positional encoding sublayer adds a fixed-size vector to the input embeddings to encode the position of each token in the sequence.\n\n--- Layer normalization\n\nThe layer normalization sublayer is used to normalize the outputs of each sublayer. This helps to stabilize the training process and improve the performance of the model.\n\n Pseudocode\n\nThe following pseudocode shows the encoder-decoder mechanism of the transformer architecture:\n\n    function transformer(x, y):\n        x_mask = create_mask(x)\n        y_mask = create_look_ahead_mask(y)\n        \n        encoder_output = encoder(x, x_mask)\n        decoder_output = decoder(y, encoder_output, y_mask)\n        \n        return decoder_output\n\n    function encoder(x, x_mask):\n        for _ in range(num_layers):\n            with reuse(scope):\n                multi_headed_attention_output = multi_headed_self_attention(x, x, x, x_mask)\n                x = layer_norm(multi_headed_attention_output + x)\n                \n                feed_forward_output = feed_forward(x)\n                x = layer_norm(feed_forward_output + x)\n        \n        return x\n\n    function decoder(y, encoder_output, y_mask):\n        for _ in range(num_layers):\n            with reuse(scope):\n                masked_multi_headed_attention_output = masked_multi_headed_self_attention(y, y, y, y_mask)\n                y = layer_norm(masked_multi_headed_attention_output + y)\n                \n                multi_headed_attention_output = multi_headed_attention(y, encoder_output, encoder_output, y_mask)\n                y = layer_norm(multi_headed_attention_output + y)\n                \n                feed_forward_output = feed_forward(y)\n                y = layer_norm(feed_forward_output + y)\n        \n        return y\n\nThis pseudocode assumes that the encoder and decoder each consist of a variable number of layers, and that the multi-headed self-attention and multi-headed attention sublayers are implemented using the attention mechanism described above. The create_mask and create_look_ahead_mask functions are used to create the appropriate masks for the encoder and decoder, and the layer_norm function is used to apply layer normalization to the outputs of each sublayer.\n\n Terminology\n\n--- Variants\n\n* Encoder-Only Transformers: Used in models like BERT, where the transformer is used only for encoding the input sequence.\n* Decoder-Only Transformers: Used in models like GPT, where the transformer is used only for generating the output sequence.\n* Encoder-Decoder Transformers: Used in models like T5, where the transformer is used for both encoding the input sequence and decoding the output sequence.\n\n--- Uses\n\n* Text Embedding and Representation Learning: Used in models like BERT, where the transformer is used to learn rich contextualized representations of text.\n* Machine Translation: Used in models like NMT, where the transformer is used to translate text from one language to another.\n* Text Summarization: Used in models like BART, where the transformer is used to generate a summary of a given text.\n* Question Answering: Used in models like BERT, where the transformer is used to answer a given question based on a given context.\n* Text Generation: Used in models like GPT, where the transformer is used to generate text based on a given prompt.\n\n--- Specialized variations\n\n* Multimodal Transformers: Used in models like CLIP, where the transformer is used to learn joint representations of text and images.\n* Vision Transformers: Used in models like ViT, where the transformer is used to classify images.\n* Time Series Transformers: Used in models like Informer, where the transformer is used to forecast time series data.\n* Protein Folding Transformers: Used in models like AlphaFold, where the transformer is used to predict the 3D structure of proteins from their amino acid sequence.\n\n--- Subsequent work\n\nSubsequent work to the transformer architecture has focused on improving its efficiency and scalability, as well as extending its applicability to a wider range of tasks. Some notable developments include:\n\n* Reformer: A variant of the transformer that uses locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) to reduce the computational complexity of the attention mechanism to O(n log n) <cit.>.\n* Longformer: A variant of the transformer that extends the attention mechanism to support long-range dependencies in the input sequence <cit.>.\n* BigBird: A variant of the transformer that uses a sparse attention mechanism to improve the efficiency of the attention mechanism <cit.>.\n* Sparse Transformers: A framework for designing sparse attention mechanisms for the transformer architecture <cit.>.\n* Linear Attention Transformers: A variant of the transformer that uses linear attention to reduce the computational complexity of the attention mechanism to O(n) <cit.>.\n\n Alternative activation functions\n\nThe feedforward module in the transformer architecture uses the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function. However, other activation functions can be used instead, such as the SwiGLU activation function in the Llama series of models and the GELU activation function in GPT-1 and BERT.\n\n Alternative normalizations\n\nIn addition to the LayerNorm normalization, the transformer architecture can use other normalization techniques, such as RMSNorm in the Llama series of models.\n\n Alternative positional encodings\n\nIn addition to the sinusoidal positional encoding, the transformer architecture can use other positional encoding methods, such as learned positional embeddings in BERT and absolute positional embeddings in the BigBird model.\n\n RoPE\n\nThe Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) is a technique for positional encoding in transformer architectures that uses rotary embeddings to encode the position of each token in the input sequence.\n\nMathematically, RoPE encodes the position of a token at index $i$ in the input sequence as a pair of sinusoidal functions:\n\n    $$\n    \\begin{aligned}\n        \\text{RoPE}(x_i, pos) &= (x_i \\cdot (\\cos(pos / 10000^(2i/d_model)), x_i \\cdot(\\sin(pos / 10000^(2i/d_model))) ) \n    \n        pos_i     &= 2\\pi \\cdot 10000^-(2 [j] / d_\\text{model})\n    \\end{aligned}\n    $$\n\nwhere $x_i$ is the input token, $pos$ is the position of the token in the sequence, $d_\\text{model}$ is the dimensionality of the input tokens, and $[j]$ refers to the $j$-th element of the input token.\n\nDuring the attention computation, the rotary embeddings are applied to the query and key vectors using a rotary embedding matrix $R$:\n\n    $\n    [Q, K]_j = R_j \u00b7 [Q, K]_j\n    $\n\nwhere $[Q, K]_j$ is the $j$-th element of the query or key vector, and $R_j$ is the $j$-th row of the rotary embedding matrix.\n\nThe advantage of RoPE over other positional encoding methods is that it allows the transformer to attend to relative positions in the input sequence, rather than absolute positions. This makes the model more invariant to the length of the input sequence and can improve performance on tasks with varying input lengths.\n\nALiBi\n\nAttention with Linear Biases (ALiBi) is a positional encoding method for transformers that replaces the fixed sinusoidal positional embeddings with a simple linear bias term that increases linearly with the distance between tokens.\n\nMathematically, the ALiBi bias for the attention score between tokens $i$ and $j$ is computed as:\n\n    $\n    b_i, j = -|i - j|/K\n    $\n\nwhere $K$ is a learnable scalar parameter that controls the slope of the linear bias.\n\nDuring the attention computation, the ALiBi bias is added to the attention scores:\n\n    $\n    S = QK^\u22a4 + ALiBiBias\n    $\n\nwhere $Q$ and $K$ are the query and key matrices, respectively, and $ALiBiBias$ is the ALiBi bias matrix.\n\nThe advantage of ALiBi over other positional encoding methods is that it is simpler and cheaper to compute than sinusoidal positional embeddings or rotary embeddings. It also avoids the potential issues with positional embeddings that arise from the periodicity of the sinusoidal functions.\n\nUnlike RoPE, ALiBi does not learn relative positions, but it is cheaper to compute and can still improve the performance of the transformer on tasks with varying input lengths.\n\nRelative Position Encodings\n\nRelative position encodings are a method for encoding the relative position between tokens in a sequence, rather than their absolute positions. This allows the model to attend to relative positions in the input sequence, rather than absolute positions.\n\nMathematically, the relative position encoding for the attention score between tokens $i$ and $j$ is computed as:\n\n    $\n    b_i, j = W_r[p_i - p_j]\n    $\n\nwhere $p_i$ and $p_j$ are the absolute positions of tokens $i$ and $j$, respectively, and $W_r$ is a learnable matrix that maps the difference in positions to a bias term.\n\nDuring the attention computation, the relative position encoding bias is added to the attention scores:\n\n    $\n    S = QK^\u22a4 + b_i, j\n    $\n\nwhere $Q$ and $K$ are the query and key matrices, respectively, and $b_i, j$ is the relative position encoding bias.\n\nThe advantage of relative position encodings over other positional encoding methods is that they allow the transformer to attend to relative positions in the input sequence, rather than absolute positions. This makes the model more invariant to the length of the input sequence and can improve performance on tasks with varying input lengths.\n\nUnlike RoPE, ALiBi, and sinusoidal positional embeddings, relative position encodings do not assume any particular form for the positional encoding, and can therefore capture more complex relationships between positions in the sequence.\n\n Efficient implementation\n\nThe transformer model is implemented in various deep learning frameworks, such as TensorFlow and PyTorch. The Transformers library by Hugging Face provides a unified interface for working with transformer models in Python.\n\n KV caching\n\nKV caching is a technique for efficient decoding of autoregressive transformers that stores the key-value pairs of previously generated tokens, so that they can be reused in subsequent decoding steps.\n\n FlashAttention\n\nFlashAttention is a communication-avoiding algorithm for the attention mechanism that uses a blocked algorithm and GPU tensor cores to achieve high throughput on modern GPUs.\n\n FlashAttention-2\n\nFlashAttention-2 is an extension of FlashAttention that supports arbitrary padding and is compatible with mixed-precision training.\n\n Multi-Query Attention\n\nMulti-Query Attention is a variant of the attention mechanism that uses a single query head instead of multiple heads. This reduces the computational complexity of the attention mechanism and can improve training speed and memory efficiency.\n\n Speculative decoding\n\nSpeculative decoding is a technique for accelerating the decoding of autoregressive transformers by decoding multiple tokens in parallel using a technique called speculative decoding.\n\nThe basic idea of speculative decoding is to decode multiple tokens in parallel by generating multiple possible continuations of the input sequence and selecting the most likely continuation based on a scoring function.\n\nThe scoring function can be based on the log probabilities of the generated tokens or on a more sophisticated metric, such as a language model score.\n\nThe generated continuations can be stored in a cache and used as input for the next decoding step, allowing the model to generate multiple tokens in parallel.\n\nThe advantage of speculative decoding is that it can significantly reduce the decoding time of autoregressive transformers while maintaining high-quality outputs. This makes it particularly useful for applications such as language translation, text generation, and speech recognition.\n\nThe disadvantage of speculative decoding is that it requires additional memory to store the generated continuations and can be computationally expensive if too many tokens are decoded in parallel.\n\nThere are several ways to implement speculative decoding, including beam search, diversity-promoting decoding, and nucleus sampling.\n\n Beam search\n\nBeam search is a decoding strategy that maintains a fixed number of candidate hypotheses at each decoding step. At each step, the top-k hypotheses are expanded, and the bottom-k hypotheses are pruned based on their likelihood scores.\n\nThe process is repeated until a stopping criterion is met, such as reaching a maximum length or generating an end-of-sequence token.\n\nThe advantage of beam search is that it can find high-quality hypotheses by exploring a larger portion of the hypothesis space than greedy decoding.\n\nThe disadvantage of beam search is that it can be computationally expensive and memory-intensive, especially for long sequences or large beams.\n\nDiversity-promoting decoding\n\nDiversity-promoting decoding is a decoding strategy that encourages the model to generate diverse outputs by penalizing hypotheses that are similar to each other.\n\nOne popular diversity-promoting decoding strategy is nucleus sampling, which selects a subset of hypotheses based on their cumulative likelihood probabilities and samples from this subset.\n\nAnother diversity-promoting decoding strategy is top-p sampling, which selects a subset of hypotheses based on their cumulative probabilities and samples from this subset.\n\nThe advantage of diversity-promoting decoding is that it can generate diverse outputs that are useful for applications such as text generation and creative writing.\n\nThe disadvantage of diversity-promoting decoding is that it can be less efficient than other decoding strategies, such as greedy decoding or beam search, and may require additional tuning to achieve good results.\n\nNucleus sampling\n\nNucleus sampling is a decoding strategy that selects a subset of hypotheses based on their cumulative likelihood probabilities and samples from this subset.\n\nThe subset of hypotheses is defined as the smallest set of hypotheses whose cumulative likelihood probabilities exceed a threshold value, known as the \"nucleus.\"\n\nThe advantage of nucleus sampling is that it can generate diverse outputs while maintaining a controlled level of diversity.\n\nThe disadvantage of nucleus sampling is that it can be less efficient than other decoding strategies, such as greedy decoding or beam search, and may require additional tuning to achieve good results.\n\n Sub-quadratic transformers\n\nSub-quadratic transformers are transformer architectures that achieve sub-quadratic complexity in the sequence length, allowing them to handle long sequences more efficiently.\n\nThe most common approach to achieve sub-quadratic complexity is to use attention mechanisms that operate on smaller subsets of tokens, such as the sliding-window attention mechanism or the sparse attention mechanism.\n\nSliding-window attention operates on a fixed-size window of tokens around the current position, reducing the complexity from quadratic to linear in the sequence length.\n\nSparse attention operates on a sparsely sampled subset of tokens, reducing the complexity from quadratic to sub-quadratic in the sequence length.\n\nThe advantage of sub-quadratic transformers is that they can handle long sequences more efficiently, making them useful for applications such as long-form text generation and speech recognition.\n\nThe disadvantage of sub-quadratic transformers is that they may sacrifice some accuracy compared to standard transformers, and may require additional tuning to achieve good results.\n\n Alternative attention graphs\n\nAlternative attention graphs are modifications to the standard attention mechanism that aim to improve the efficiency or effectiveness of the attention mechanism.\n\nOne popular alternative attention graph is the Reformer, which uses locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) to approximate the attention mechanism and reduce the complexity from quadratic to linear in the sequence length.\n\nAnother popular alternative attention graph is the Longformer, which extends the attention mechanism to support long-range dependencies in the input sequence.\n\nThe advantage of alternative attention graphs is that they can reduce the computational complexity of the attention mechanism, making it possible to train larger models or handle longer sequences.\n\nThe disadvantage of alternative attention graphs is that they may sacrifice some accuracy compared to standard transformers, and may require additional tuning to achieve good results.\n\n Random Feature Attention\n\nRandom Feature Attention (RFA) is a simplified version of the attention mechanism that uses random projections to approximate the attention scores.\n\nMathematically, RFA computes the attention scores as follows:\n\n    $\n    S_i, j = x_i^\u22a4\u00b7Rx_j\n    $\n\nwhere $x_i$ and $x_j$ are the input tokens, $R$ is a random projection matrix, and $\u00b7$ denotes the Hadamard product.\n\nDuring the attention computation, the RFA scores are normalized using softmax:\n\n    $\n    A_i, j = \\text{softmax}(S_i, j / \u221a(d))\n    $\n\nwhere $d$ is the dimensionality of the input tokens, and $\\text{softmax}$ is the softmax function.\n\nThe advantage of RFA over the standard attention mechanism is that it is cheaper to compute, as it avoids the need to compute the dot product of all pairs of input tokens. Instead, it uses a random projection matrix to project the input tokens onto a lower-dimensional space, where the dot product can be computed more efficiently.\n\nThe disadvantage of RFA is that it may not capture all the pairwise interactions between the input tokens, as it relies on random projections to approximate the attention scores. This may limit its ability to capture complex relationships between the input tokens.\n\nUnlike the standard attention mechanism, RFA does not use learnable parameters to compute the attention scores, making it a simpler and more lightweight alternative. However, this also means that RFA may not be able to learn as complex or nuanced relationships between the input tokens as the standard attention mechanism.\n\n Multimodality\n\nThe transformer architecture has been successfully applied to a wide range of tasks beyond natural language processing, including computer vision, speech recognition, and reinforcement learning.\n\nOne way to extend the transformer to handle multiple modalities is to use a shared embedding space, where the input tokens from different modalities are mapped to a common latent space using a shared set of parameters.\n\nFor example, in the case of image-text matching, the image features can be extracted using a convolutional neural network (CNN) and the text features can be extracted using a transformer-based language model, and both sets of features can be mapped to a common embedding space using a shared set of parameters.\n\nAnother way to extend the transformer to handle multiple modalities is to use a modular architecture, where each modality is processed by a separate module, and the outputs of the modules are combined using a fusion module.\n\nFor example, in the case of image-text matching, the image features can be extracted using a CNN and the text features can be extracted using a transformer-based language model, and both sets of features can be processed by separate transformer-based modules, and the outputs of the modules can be combined using a fusion module.\n\nThe advantage of using a shared embedding space is that it allows the model to learn a common representation of the different modalities, which can improve the model's ability to handle tasks that involve multiple modalities.\n\nThe disadvantage of using a shared embedding space is that it may require more training data to learn the shared representation, and the model may be sensitive to differences in the feature distributions of the different modalities.\n\nThe advantage of using a modular architecture is that it allows the model to specialize in each modality, which can improve the model's ability to handle tasks that involve multiple modalities.\n\nThe disadvantage of using a modular architecture is that it may require more computational resources to process the different modalities, and the model may be less able to handle tasks that require integrating information from multiple modalities.\n\nBoth approaches have been successfully applied to a wide range of multimodal tasks, including image classification, object detection, image captioning, visual question answering, speech recognition, and natural language understanding.\n\n Applications\n\nThe transformer architecture has been applied to a wide range of applications, including natural language processing, computer vision, speech recognition, and reinforcement learning.\n\nIn natural language processing, the transformer architecture has been used for tasks such as language modeling, machine translation, text summarization, and question answering.\n\nIn computer vision, the transformer architecture has been used for tasks such as image classification, object detection, and image segmentation.\n\nIn speech recognition, the transformer architecture has been used for tasks such as automatic speech recognition and speech synthesis.\n\nIn reinforcement learning, the transformer architecture has been used for tasks such as playing video games and controlling robots.\n\nThe transformer architecture has been widely adopted due to its ability to handle long sequences and its strong performance on a wide range of tasks. However, it can be computationally expensive and memory-intensive, particularly for long sequences or large models.\n\nSee also\n\n* List of machine learning algorithms\n* List of natural language processing algorithms\n* List of computer vision algorithms\n* List of speech recognition algorithms\n* List of reinforcement learning algorithms\n\nNotes\n\n* \u2191 Vaswani, Ashish; Shazeer, Noam; Parmar, Niki; Uszkoreit, Jakob; Jones, Llion; Gomez, Aidan N.; Kaiser, Lukasz; Polosukhin, Illia (2017). \"Attention Is All You Need\". arXiv:1706.03762 [cs.CL].\n* \u2191 Devlin, Jacob; Chang, Ming-Wei; Lee, Kenton; Toutanova, Kristina (2019). \"BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding\" (PDF).
