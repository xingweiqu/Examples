Incorporate appropriate references and adhere to Wikipedia's neutral point of view.", "input": "", "output": "Introduction\nNamed-entity recognition (NER) (also known as (named) entity identification, entity chunking, and entity extraction) is a subtask of information extraction that seeks to locate and classify named entities mentioned in unstructured text into pre-defined categories such as person names, organizations, locations, medical codes, time expressions, quantities, monetary values, percentages, etc.\nMost research on NER/NEE systems has been structured as taking an unannotated block of text, such as this one:\n\nJim bought 300 shares of Acme Corp. in 2006.\nAnd producing an annotated block of text that highlights the names of entities:\n\n[Jim]Person bought 300 shares of [Acme Corp.]Organization in [2006]Time.\nIn this example, a person name consisting of one token, a two-token company name and a temporal expression have been detected and classified.\nState-of-the-art NER systems for English produce near-human performance. For example, the best system entering MUC-7 scored 93.39% of F-measure while human annotators scored 97.60% and 96.95%.Named-entity recognition platforms\nNotable NER platforms include:\n\nGATE supports NER across many languages and domains out of the box, usable via a graphical interface and a Java API.\nOpenNLP includes rule-based and statistical named-entity recognition.\nSpaCy features fast statistical NER as well as an open-source named-entity visualizer.\nTransformers features token classification using deep learning models.Problem definition\nIn the expression named entity, the word named restricts the task to those entities for which one or many strings, such as words or phrases, stand (fairly) consistently for some referent. This is closely related to rigid designators, as defined by Kripke, although in practice NER deals with many names and referents that are not philosophically \"rigid\". For instance, the automotive company created by Henry Ford in 1903 can be referred to as Ford or Ford Motor Company, although \"Ford\" can refer to many other entities as well (see Ford). Rigid designators include proper names as well as terms for certain biological species and substances, but exclude pronouns (such as \"it\"; see coreference resolution), descriptions that pick out a referent by its properties (see also De dicto and de re), and names for kinds of things as opposed to individuals (for example \"Bank\").\nFull named-entity recognition is often broken down, conceptually and possibly also in implementations, as two distinct problems: detection of names, and classification of the names by the type of entity they refer to (e.g. person, organization, or location).\nThe first phase is typically simplified to a segmentation problem: names are defined to be contiguous spans of tokens, with no nesting, so that \"Bank of America\" is a single name, disregarding the fact that inside this name, the substring \"America\" is itself a name. This segmentation problem is formally similar to chunking. The second phase requires choosing an ontology by which to organize categories of things.\nTemporal expressions and some numerical expressions (e.g., money, percentages, etc.) may also be considered as named entities in the context of the NER task. While some instances of these types are good examples of rigid designators (e.g., the year 2001) there are also many invalid ones (e.g., I take my vacations in \u201cJune\u201d). In the first case, the year 2001 refers to the 2001st year of the Gregorian calendar. In the second case, the month June may refer to the month of an undefined year (past June, next June, every June, etc.). It is arguable that the definition of named entity is loosened in such cases for practical reasons. The definition of the term named entity is therefore not strict and often has to be explained in the context in which it is used.\nCertain hierarchies of named entity types have been proposed in the literature. BBN categories, proposed in 2002, are used for question answering and consists of 29 types and 64 subtypes. Sekine's extended hierarchy, proposed in 2002, is made of 200 subtypes. More recently, in 2011 Ritter used a hierarchy based on common Freebase entity types in ground-breaking experiments on NER over social media text.Formal evaluation\nTo evaluate the quality of an NER system's output, several measures have been defined. The usual measures are called precision, recall, and F1 score. However, several issues remain in just how to calculate those values.\nThese statistical measures work reasonably well for the obvious cases of finding or missing a real entity exactly; and for finding a non-entity. However, NER can fail in many other ways, many of which are arguably \"partially correct\", and should not be counted as complete success or failures. For example, identifying a real entity, but: \n\nwith fewer tokens than desired (for example, missing the last token of \"John Smith, M.D.\")\nwith more tokens than desired (for example, including the first word of \"The University of MD\")\npartitioning adjacent entities differently (for example, treating \"Smith, Jones Robinson\" as 2 vs. 3 entities)\nassigning it a completely wrong type (for example, calling a personal name an organization)\nassigning it a related but inexact type (for example, \"substance\" vs. \"drug\", or \"school\" vs. \"organization\")\ncorrectly identifying an entity, when what the user wanted was a smaller- or larger-scope entity (for example, identifying \"James Madison\" as a personal name, when it's part of \"James Madison University\"). Some NER systems impose the restriction that entities may never overlap or nest, which means that in some cases one must make arbitrary or task-specific choices.\nOne overly simple method of measuring accuracy is merely to count what fraction of all tokens in the text were correctly or incorrectly identified as part of entity references (or as being entities of the correct type). This suffers from at least two problems: first, the vast majority of tokens in real-world text are not part of entity names, so the baseline accuracy (always predict \"not an entity\") is extravagantly high, typically >90%; and second, mispredicting the full span of an entity name is not properly penalized (finding only a person's first name when his last name follows might be scored as \u00bd accuracy).\nIn academic conferences such as CoNLL, a variant of the F1 score has been defined as follows:\n\nPrecision is the number of predicted entity name spans that line up exactly with spans in the gold standard evaluation data. I.e. when [Person Hans] [Person Blick] is predicted but [Person Hans Blick] was required, precision for the predicted name is zero. Precision is then averaged over all predicted entity names.\nRecall is similarly the number of names in the gold standard that appear at exactly the same location in the predictions.\nF1 score is the harmonic mean of these two.\nIt follows from the above definition that any prediction that misses a single token, includes a spurious token, or has the wrong class, is a hard error and does not contribute positively to either precision or recall. Thus, this measure may be said to be pessimistic: it can be the case that many \"errors\" are close to correct, and might be adequate for a given purpose. For example, one system might always omit titles such as \"Ms.\" or \"Ph.D.\", but be compared to a system or ground-truth data that expects titles to be included. In that case, every such name is treated as an error. Because of such issues, it is important actually to examine the kinds of errors, and decide how important they are given one's goals and requirements.\nEvaluation models based on a token-by-token matching have been proposed. Such models may be given partial credit for overlapping matches (such as using the Intersection over Union criterion). They allow a finer grained evaluation and comparison of extraction systems.Approaches\nNER systems have been created that use linguistic grammar-based techniques as well as statistical models such as machine learning. Hand-crafted grammar-based systems typically obtain better precision, but at the cost of lower recall and months of work by experienced computational linguists. Statistical NER systems typically require a large amount of manually annotated training data. Semisupervised approaches have been suggested to avoid part of the annotation effort.\nMany different classifier types have been used to perform machine-learned NER, with conditional random fields being a typical choice.Problem domains\nIn 2001, research indicated that even state-of-the-art NER systems were brittle, meaning that NER systems developed for one domain did not typically perform well on other domains. Considerable effort is involved in tuning NER systems to perform well in a new domain; this is true for both rule-based and trainable statistical systems.\nEarly work in NER systems in the 1990s was aimed primarily at extraction from journalistic articles. Attention then turned to processing of military dispatches and reports. Later stages of the automatic content extraction (ACE) evaluation also included several types of informal text styles, such as weblogs and text transcripts from conversational telephone speech conversations. Since about 1998, there has been a great deal of interest in entity identification in the molecular biology, bioinformatics, and medical natural language processing communities.  The most common entity of interest in that domain has been names of genes and gene products. There has been also considerable interest in the recognition of chemical entities and drugs in the context of the CHEMDNER\ncompetition, with 27 teams participating in this task.Current challenges and research\nDespite high F1 numbers reported on the MUC-7 dataset, the problem of named-entity recognition is far from being solved. The main efforts are directed to reducing the annotations labor by employing semi-supervised learning, robust performance across domains and scaling up to fine-grained entity types. In recent years, many projects have turned to crowdsourcing, which is a promising solution to obtain high-quality aggregate human judgments for supervised and semi-supervised machine learning approaches to NER. Another challenging task is devising models to deal with linguistically complex contexts such as Twitter and search queries.\nThere are some researchers who did some comparisons about the NER performances from different statistical models such as HMM (hidden Markov model), ME (maximum entropy), and CRF (conditional random fields), and feature sets. And some researchers recently proposed graph-based semi-supervised learning model for language specific NER tasks.\nA recently emerging task of identifying \"important expressions\" in text and cross-linking them to Wikipedia can be seen as an instance of extremely fine-grained named-entity recognition, where the types are the actual Wikipedia pages describing the (potentially ambiguous) concepts. Below is an example output of a Wikification system:\n\nAnother field that has seen progress but remains challenging is the application of NER to Twitter and other microblogs, considered \"noisy\" due to non-standard orthography, shortness and informality of texts. NER challenges in English Tweets have been organized by research communities to compare performances of various approaches, such as bidirectional LSTMs, Learning-to-Search, or CRFs.See also\nControlled vocabulary\nCoreference resolution\nEntity linking (aka named entity normalization, entity disambiguation)\nInformation extraction\nKnowledge extraction\nOnomastics\nRecord linkage\nSmart tag (Microsoft)\n\n\n== References ==", "result": "# Named-entity recognition\n\nNamed-entity recognition (NER), also called named-entity tagging, is a task of information extraction which aims to automatically find named entities in unstructured text, such as dates, locations, monetary values, percentages, and numbers, but most importantly, named entities. These are commonly nouns or phrases that refer to concrete or abstract objects in the world such as companies, organizations, people, products, events, diseases, species, etc. In addition to recognizing named entities, NER systems usually classify named entities into a pre-defined category. State-of-the-art systems reach performances comparable to humans on this task.\n\n Named-entity recognition platforms\n\nSeveral platforms exist for named-entity recognition, including GATE (General Architecture for Text Engineering), OpenNLP, Stanford NER, Spacy, and many others. These platforms use either rule-based approaches or machine learning approaches. Most modern systems employ deep learning techniques with neural networks.\n\n Problem definition\n\nA named entity recognition system is a sequence function $f$ which takes as input a sequence of tokens $x=(x_1, x_2,$ ..., $x_n)$ and outputs a sequence of tags $y=(y_1, y_2,$ ..., $y_n)$, where each element $y_i$ in the output sequence is a label referring to a specific named entity class (for example, $y_i$ could refer to the class PER, which stands for \"person\"). Named entity recognition can be seen as a special case of sequence prediction, where the prediction goal is to assign each element in a sequence an appropriate label.\n\nThere are two main phases in the history of named entity recognition: the phase of rule-based systems, and the phase of statistical or data-driven systems. In the first phase, systems were based on linguistical rules and required significant amount of time to build and adjust. The second phase is based on statistical learning, which \"automates\" the rule construction and adjustment phases through the use of training data.\n\nMost named entity recognition systems today are statistical, data-driven systems. These systems rely on the availability of a sufficiently large corpus of text that has already been annotated with named entities. The systems then learn statistical models which predict the appropriate named entity class for each word in the unannotated text. This process can be broken down into the following steps:\n\n* Acquisition of a labeled corpus: a corpus is a large body of text; a labeled corpus is one in which the named entities have already been annotated.\n* Statistical modeling: using a combination of algorithms and statistical methods, the data from the labeled corpus is used to build predictive models. These models will assign a probability to each possible named entity class for each token in the unannotated text.\n* Prediction: the predictive models assign a probability to each possible named entity class for each word in the unannotated text. Some probabilities will be higher than others, and the model chooses the class with the highest probability for each word.\n* Decoding: the output is a list of named entities, each with its own classification.\n\n--- Temporal expressions\n\nTemporal expressions (dates, times, durations, etc.) are a special type of named entity that require special treatment in natural language processing. This is because temporal expressions can be represented in many different ways in text, and these representations are often ambiguous (for example, the text \"yesterday\", \"2 days ago\", and \"the day before yesterday\" all refer to the same temporal expression, but a system that does not understand coreference will incorrectly treat them as distinct). Further complicating matters, many temporal expressions in text are imprecise; for example, the expression \"yesterday\" does not specify a particular date. Humans can easily understand the meaning of such temporals in the context of the sentence, but state-of-the-art NLP techniques still struggle to do this.\n\nIn addition to temporal expressions in text, there are also temporal expressions in time-based domains (for example, video and audio). These expressions take the form of speech or spoken language, and they must be transcribed before they can be processed by NLP system. Processing temporal expressions in time-based domains requires temporal named entity recognition, which is more difficult than standard NER.\n\nTemporal named entity recognition systems are similar to regular NER systems, with one major exception: they take into account the temporal relationships between different tokens in the text. There are two main approaches to modeling these temporal relationships: rule-based approaches and dependency-based approaches. Rule-based approaches require the construction of a temporal lexicon, in which temporal operators (words referring to time, such as \"yesterday\" or \"ago\") are paired with one another based on their temporal relationships (\"yesterday\" is paired with \"ago\", because both refer to past temporal expressions). These rules are used to disambiguate temporal expressions. Dependency-based approaches instead construct a dependency tree for the tokens in the text. This tree is generated based on the temporal dependencies between different tokens. Once the tree has been generated, the nodes of the tree are assigned to different named entity classes.\n\n Formal evaluation\n\nThe goal of NER is to identify all instances of named entities in a text, and to mark each instance with its corresponding class. A named entity instance is typically a span of words (for example, \"George Washington\"), but it can also be a single word that functions as a standalone named entity (for example, \"Microsoft\"). There are several standard metrics used to evaluate the performance of NER systems.\n\n--- Token-level metrics\n\nLet $\\mathit{tp}$ be the number of tokens that are correctly predicted, let $\\mathit{fp}$ be the number of tokens that are incorrectly predicted, and let $\\mathit{fn}$ be the number of tokens that are missed. Then we have:\n\n    $\\mathrm {Precision} _{\\mathrm {token} }={\\frac {\\mathrm {tp} }{\\mathrm {tp} +\\mathrm {fp} }}$\n\nand\n\n    $\\mathrm {Recall} _{\\mathrm {token} }={\\frac {\\mathrm {tp} }{\\mathrm {tp} +\\mathrm {fn} }}$\n\nF-measure combines the precision and recall metrics into a single measure of performance. Let $\\beta$ be a parameter that weights the relative importance of precision and recall:\n\n    $\\mathrm {F} _{\\beta ,\\mathrm {token} }={\\frac {(1+\\beta ^{2})\\cdot \\mathrm {precision} _{\\mathrm {token} }\\cdot \\mathrm {recall} _{\\mathrm {token} }}{\\beta ^{2}\\cdot \\mathrm {precision} _{\\mathrm {token} }+\\mathrm {recall} _{\\mathrm {token} }}}$\n\nToken-level metrics are straightforward to understand, but they can be problematic in certain situations. In particular, if a piece of text contains many named entities, a token-level metric will be strongly biased against systems that have poor boundary detection (for example, a system that fails to recognize the name \"Google\" as a named entity, but instead recognizes it as two separate named entities \"Go\" and \"ogle\").\n\n--- Entity-level metrics\n\nTo address the problem described above, Chen and Hovy introduced entity-level metrics, which count named entities (as opposed to individual tokens) as atomic units. Let $\\mathit{tp_e}$ be the number of named entities that are correctly predicted, let $\\mathit{fp_e}$ be the number of named entities that are incorrectly predicted, and let $\\mathit{fn_e}$ be the number of named entities that are missed. Then we have:\n\n    $\\mathrm {Precision} _{\\mathrm {entity} }={\\frac {\\mathrm {tp} _{e}}{\\mathrm {tp} _{e}+\\mathrm {fp} _{e}}}$\n\nand\n\n    $\\mathrm {Recall} _{\\mathrm {entity} }={\\frac {\\mathrm {tp} _{e}}{\\mathrm {tp} _{e}+\\mathrm {fn} _{e}}}$\n\nF-measure for entity-level metrics is computed in the same way as F-measure for token-level metrics.\n\nEntity-level metrics address the problems with token-level metrics, but they have problems of own. In particular, it is possible for an NER system to generate nested entities (for example, to predict that the phrase \"Bill Gates\" is a named entity, and also predict that the phrase \"Gates\" is a named entity), but entity-level metrics will not count this as an error. As Kowsari and Kianpi note, entity-level metrics are also problematic when it comes to dealing with lists of entities: for example, if a piece of text contains a list of five companies, an entity-level metric will count a system as correct if it correctly identifies four of the companies, while a token-level metric will count the system as partially correct only if it correctly identifies all five companies.\n\n--- Other metrics\n\nOther metrics include counting the number of systems that outperform humans, or the opposite -- the percentage of tasks that require post-editing. The latter metric is used when extremely accurate systems are needed, and human annotators are available to assess the output of the NER system.\n\n Approaches\n\nThere are two main approaches to named entity recognition: linguistic grammar-based and statistical models.\n\nGrammar-based approaches to named entity recognition use regular expressions to identify patterns in the text. These systems rely heavily on linguistic resources such as wordlists and grammars, and they tend to be very language-dependent. However, they can be highly accurate when they are applied to the right domain (for example, a system trained on medical texts will perform poorly on general news texts).\n\nStatistical models for named entity recognition rely on machine learning and large corpora of text. The models \"learn\" the features of each named entity category, and can then apply these features to new, unseen text in order to classify unknown named entities. The most common implementation of this approach is the hidden Markov model (HMM); this approach works well across a variety of languages and domains, but it can be less accurate than rule-based approaches.\n\nIn recent years, there have been many attempts to improve statistical NER using newer deep learning techniques, such as systems based on character-level convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks. LSTM-based neural networks have been shown to perform competitively with state-of-the-art rule-based systems.\n\n Problem domains\n\nState-of-the-art NER systems are generally not very good at recognizing named entities from previously unseen domains. For example, a NER system trained on medical texts will perform close to perfectly on medical texts, but will perform very poorly on financial texts. This is because it has only been exposed to medical language and cannot generalize across domains.\n\nThis domain specificity is a problem for many real-world NER applications, which often require systems that can process multiple domains. It is typically addressed via supervised domain adaptation. In this approach, the basic idea is to train a NER system on one or more source domains, and then fine-tune it on a relevant target domain. The transfer learning paradigm can also be used in the case of low resource languages. Here, the basic idea is to train a NER system in a high resource language and then use transfer learning to improve NER in the low resource language.\n\nThe earliest work on domain adaptation for NER attempted to adapt a NER system to a new domain by retraining it on the new domain's training data. More recently, however, unsupervised domain adaptation methods have been developed. These methods avoid requiring labeled data from the new domain; instead, they use unlabeled data from the new domain along with the large supply of labeled data from the source domain. Unsupervised domain adaptation is a relatively new area of research, but it holds promise for developing NER systems that can dynamically adapt to new domains without requiring any labeled data.\n\nOne of the problems with NER in general, and with domain adaptation for NER in particular, is the high cost of creating labeled corpora of text. Supervised learning for NER requires annotated training data, and this annotation process is time-consuming and expensive. One solution to this problem is to use unsupervised learning techniques instead. Unsupervised NER systems make no guarantees about the accuracy of their predictions, but they can operate on unannotated, \"raw\" text, which is available in vast quantities. Recent advances in unsupervised NER include systems that use character-level CNNs and character-level LSTM networks.\n\n See also\n\n* Coreference resolution, the task of identifying mentions of the same entity in a text\n* Disambiguation (disambiguation), the process of resolving multiple meanings of an expression\n* Linking (semantic), process of connecting semantic entities with their references\n* Vocabulary control, limiting the number of distinct words in a text\n* Word sense disambiguation, the task of identifying the meaning of a word in a given context\n"}, {"instruction": "You are an AI editor writing a complete Wikipedia article that adheres to Wikipedia's content standards.

LLMs are language models with many parameters, and are trained with self-supervised learning on a vast amount of text.\nThe largest and most capable LLMs are generative pretrained transformers (GPTs). Modern models can be fine-tuned for specific tasks or guided by prompt engineering. These models acquire predictive power regarding syntax, semantics, and ontologies inherent in human language corpora, but they also inherit inaccuracies and biases present in the data they are trained in.History\nBefore 2017, there were a few language models that were large as compared to capacities then available. In the 1990s, the IBM alignment models pioneered statistical language modelling. A smoothed n-gram model in 2001 trained on 0.3 billion words achieved state-of-the-art perplexity at the time. In the 2000s, as Internet use became prevalent, some researchers constructed Internet-scale language datasets (\"web as corpus\"), upon which they trained statistical language models. In 2009, in most language processing tasks, statistical language models dominated over symbolic language models because they can usefully ingest large datasets.\n\nAfter neural networks became dominant in image processing around 2012, they were applied to language modelling as well. Google converted its translation service to Neural Machine Translation in 2016. Because it preceded the existence of transformers, it was done by seq2seq deep LSTM networks.\nAt the 2017 NeurIPS conference, Google researchers introduced the transformer architecture in their landmark paper \"Attention Is All You Need\". This paper's goal was to improve upon 2014 seq2seq technology, and was based mainly on the attention mechanism developed by Bahdanau et al. in 2014. The following year in 2018, BERT was introduced and quickly became \"ubiquitous\". Though the original transformer has both encoder and decoder blocks, BERT is an encoder-only model. Academic and research usage of BERT began to decline in 2023, following rapid improvements in the abilities of decoder-only models (such as GPT) to solve tasks via prompting.\nAlthough decoder-only GPT-1 was introduced in 2018, it was GPT-2 in 2019 that caught widespread attention because OpenAI at first deemed it too powerful to release publicly, out of fear of malicious use. GPT-3 in 2020 went a step further and as of 2024 is available only via API with no offering of downloading the model to execute locally. But it was the 2022 consumer-facing browser-based ChatGPT that captured the imaginations of the general population and caused some media hype and online buzz. The 2023 GPT-4 was praised for its increased accuracy and as a \"holy grail\" for its multimodal capabilities. OpenAI did not reveal the high-level architecture and the number of parameters of GPT-4. The release of ChatGPT led to an uptick in LLM usage across several research subfields of computer science, including robotics, software engineering, and societal impact work. In 2024 OpenAI released the reasoning model OpenAI o1, which generates long chains of thought before returning a final answer.\nCompeting language models have for the most part been attempting to equal the GPT series, at least in terms of number of parameters.\nSince 2022, source-available models have been gaining popularity, especially at first with BLOOM and LLaMA, though both have restrictions on the field of use. Mistral AI's models Mistral 7B and Mixtral 8x7b have the more permissive Apache License. In January 2025, DeepSeek released DeepSeek R1, a 671-billion-parameter open-weight model that performs comparably to OpenAI o1 but at a much lower cost.\nSince 2023, many LLMs have been trained to be multimodal, having the ability to also process or generate other types of data, such as images or audio. These LLMs are also called large multimodal models (LMMs).\nAs of 2024, the largest and most capable models are all based on the transformer architecture. Some recent implementations are based on other architectures, such as recurrent neural network variants and Mamba (a state space model).Dataset preprocessing\nTokenization\nAs machine learning algorithms process numbers rather than text, the text must be converted to numbers. In the first step, a vocabulary is decided upon, then integer indices are arbitrarily but uniquely assigned to each vocabulary entry, and finally, an embedding is associated to the integer index. Algorithms include byte-pair encoding (BPE) and WordPiece. There are also special tokens serving as control characters, such as [MASK] for masked-out token (as used in BERT), and [UNK] (\"unknown\") for characters not appearing in the vocabulary. Also, some special symbols are used to denote special text formatting. For example, \"\u0120\" denotes a preceding whitespace in RoBERTa and GPT. \"##\" denotes continuation of a preceding word in BERT.\nFor example, the BPE tokenizer used by GPT-3 (Legacy) would split tokenizer: texts -> series of numerical \"tokens\" as\n\nTokenization also compresses the datasets. Because LLMs generally require input to be an array that is not jagged, the shorter texts must be \"padded\" until they match the length of the longest one. How many tokens are, on average, needed per word depends on the language of the dataset.BPE\nAs an example, consider a tokenizer based on byte-pair encoding. In the first step, all unique characters (including blanks and punctuation marks) are treated as an initial set of n-grams (i.e. initial set of uni-grams). Successively the most frequent pair of adjacent characters is merged into a bi-gram and all instances of the pair are replaced by it. All occurrences of adjacent pairs of (previously merged) n-grams that most frequently occur together are then again merged into even lengthier n-gram, until a vocabulary of prescribed size is obtained (in case of GPT-3, the size is 50257). After a tokenizer is trained, any text can be tokenized by it, as long as it does not contain characters not appearing in the initial-set of uni-grams.Problems\nA token vocabulary based on the frequencies extracted from mainly English corpora uses as few tokens as possible for an average English word. However, an average word in another language encoded by such an English-optimized tokenizer is split into a suboptimal amount of tokens. GPT-2 tokenizer can use up to 15 times more tokens per word for some languages, for example for the Shan language from Myanmar. Even more widespread languages such as Portuguese and German have \"a premium of 50%\" compared to English.\nGreedy tokenization also causes subtle problems with text completion.Dataset cleaning\nIn the context of training LLMs, datasets are typically cleaned by removing low-quality, duplicated, or toxic data. Cleaned datasets can increase training efficiency and lead to improved downstream performance. A trained LLM can be used to clean datasets for training a further LLM.\nWith the increasing proportion of LLM-generated content on the web, data cleaning in the future may include filtering out such content. LLM-generated content can pose a problem if the content is similar to human text (making filtering difficult) but of lower quality (degrading performance of models trained on it).Synthetic data\nTraining of largest language models might need more linguistic data than naturally available, or that the naturally occurring data is of insufficient quality. In these cases, synthetic data might be used. Microsoft's Phi series of LLMs is trained on textbook-like data generated by another LLM.Training and architecture\nReinforcement learning from human feedback\nReinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) through algorithms, such as proximal policy optimization, is used to further fine-tune a model based on a dataset of human preferences.Instruction tuning\nUsing \"self-instruct\" approaches, LLMs have been able to bootstrap correct responses, replacing any naive responses, starting from human-generated corrections of a few cases. For example, in the instruction \"Write an essay about the main themes represented in Hamlet,\" an initial naive completion might be \"If you submit the essay after March 17, your grade will be reduced by 10% for each day of delay,\" based on the frequency of this textual sequence in the corpus.Mixture of experts\nThe largest LLM may be too expensive to train and use directly. For such models, mixture of experts (MoE) can be applied, a line of research pursued by Google researchers since 2017 to train models reaching up to 1 trillion parameters.Prompt engineering, attention mechanism, and context window\nMost results previously achievable only by (costly) fine-tuning, can be achieved through prompt engineering, although limited to the scope of a single conversation (more precisely, limited to the scope of a context window).\n\nIn order to find out which tokens are relevant to each other within the scope of the context window, the attention mechanism calculates \"soft\" weights for each token, more precisely for its embedding, by using multiple attention heads, each with its own \"relevance\" for calculating its own soft weights. For example, the small (i.e. 117M parameter sized) GPT-2 model has had twelve attention heads and a context window of only 1k tokens. In its medium version it has 345M parameters and contains 24 layers, each with 12 attention heads. For the training with gradient descent a batch size of 512 was utilized.\nThe largest models, such as Google's Gemini 1.5, presented in February 2024, can have a context window sized up to 1 million (context window of 10 million was also \"successfully tested\"). Other models with large context windows includes Anthropic's Claude 2.1, with a context window of up to 200k tokens. Note that this maximum refers to the number of input tokens and that the maximum number of output tokens differs from the input and is often smaller. For example, the GPT-4 Turbo model has a maximum output of 4096 tokens.\nLength of a conversation that the model can take into account when generating its next answer is limited by the size of a context window, as well. If the length of a conversation, for example with ChatGPT, is longer than its context window, only the parts inside the context window are taken into account when generating the next answer, or the model needs to apply some algorithm to summarize the too distant parts of conversation.\nThe shortcomings of making a context window larger include higher computational cost and possibly diluting the focus on local context, while making it smaller can cause a model to miss an important long-range dependency. Balancing them is a matter of experimentation and domain-specific considerations.\nA model may be pre-trained either to predict how the segment continues, or what is missing in the segment, given a segment from its training dataset. It can be either\n\nautoregressive (i.e. predicting how the segment continues, as GPTs do): for example given a segment \"I like to eat\", the model predicts \"ice cream\", or \"sushi\".\n\"masked\" (i.e. filling in the parts missing from the segment, the way \"BERT\" does it): for example, given a segment \"I like to [__] [__] cream\", the model predicts that \"eat\" and \"ice\" are missing.\nModels may be trained on auxiliary tasks which test their understanding of the data distribution, such as Next Sentence Prediction (NSP), in which pairs of sentences are presented and the model must predict whether they appear consecutively in the training corpus. During training, regularization loss is also used to stabilize training. However regularization loss is usually not used during testing and evaluation.Infrastructure\nSubstantial infrastructure is necessary for training the largest models.Training cost\nThe qualifier \"large\" in \"large language model\" is inherently vague, as there is no definitive threshold for the number of parameters required to qualify as \"large\". As time goes on, what was previously considered \"large\" may evolve. GPT-1 of 2018 is usually considered the first LLM, even though it has only 0.117 billion parameters. The tendency towards larger models is visible in the list of large language models.\nAs technology advanced, large sums have been invested in increasingly large models. For example, training of the GPT-2 (i.e. a 1.5-billion-parameters model) in 2019 cost $50,000, while training of the PaLM (i.e. a 540-billion-parameters model) in 2022 cost $8 million, and Megatron-Turing NLG 530B (in 2021) cost around $11 million.\nFor Transformer-based LLM, training cost is much higher than inference cost. It costs 6 FLOPs per parameter to train on one token, whereas it costs 1 to 2 FLOPs per parameter to infer on one token.Tool use\nThere are certain tasks that, in principle, cannot be solved by any LLM, at least not without the use of external tools or additional software. An example of such a task is responding to the user's input '354 * 139 = ', provided that the LLM has not already encountered a continuation of this calculation in its training corpus. In such cases, the LLM needs to resort to running program code that calculates the result, which can then be included in its response.: Another example is \"What is the time now? It is \", where a separate program interpreter would need to execute a code to get system time on the computer, so that the LLM can include it in its reply. This basic strategy can be sophisticated with multiple attempts of generated programs, and other sampling strategies.\nGenerally, in order to get an LLM to use tools, one must fine-tune it for tool-use. If the number of tools is finite, then fine-tuning may be done just once. If the number of tools can grow arbitrarily, as with online API services, then the LLM can be fine-tuned to be able to read API documentation and call API correctly.\nRetrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is another approach that enhances LLMs by integrating them with document retrieval systems. Given a query, a document retriever is called to retrieve the most relevant documents. This is usually done by encoding the query and the documents into vectors, then finding the documents with vectors (usually stored in a vector database) most similar to the vector of the query. The LLM then generates an output based on both the query and context included from the retrieved documents.Agency\nAn LLM is typically not an autonomous agent by itself, as it lacks the ability to interact with dynamic environments, recall past behaviors, and plan future actions, but can be transformed into one by integrating modules like profiling, memory, planning, and action.\nThe ReAct pattern, a portmanteau of \"Reason + Act\", constructs an agent out of an LLM, using the LLM as a planner. The LLM is prompted to \"think out loud\". Specifically, the language model is prompted with a textual description of the environment, a goal, a list of possible actions, and a record of the actions and observations so far. It generates one or more thoughts before generating an action, which is then executed in the environment. The linguistic description of the environment given to the LLM planner can even be the LaTeX code of a paper describing the environment.\nIn the DEPS (\"Describe, Explain, Plan and Select\") method, an LLM is first connected to the visual world via image descriptions, then it is prompted to produce plans for complex tasks and behaviors based on its pretrained knowledge and environmental feedback it receives.\nThe Reflexion method constructs an agent that learns over multiple episodes. At the end of each episode, the LLM is given the record of the episode, and prompted to think up \"lessons learned\", which would help it perform better at a subsequent episode. These \"lessons learned\" are given to the agent in the subsequent episodes.\nMonte Carlo tree search can use an LLM as rollout heuristic. When a programmatic world model is not available, an LLM can also be prompted with a description of the environment to act as world model.\nFor open-ended exploration, an LLM can be used to score observations for their \"interestingness\", which can be used as a reward signal to guide a normal (non-LLM) reinforcement learning agent. Alternatively, it can propose increasingly difficult tasks for curriculum learning. Instead of outputting individual actions, an LLM planner can also construct \"skills\", or functions for complex action sequences. The skills can be stored and later invoked, allowing increasing levels of abstraction in planning.\nLLM-powered agents can keep a long-term memory of its previous contexts, and the memory can be retrieved in the same way as Retrieval Augmented Generation. Multiple such agents can interact socially.Compression\nTypically, LLMs are trained with single- or half-precision floating point numbers (float32 and float16). One float16 has 16 bits, or 2 bytes, and so one billion parameters require 2 gigabytes. The largest models typically have 100 billion parameters, requiring 200 gigabytes to load, which places them outside the range of most consumer electronics.\nPost-training quantization aims to decrease the space requirement by lowering precision of the parameters of a trained model, while preserving most of its performance. The simplest form of quantization simply truncates all numbers to a given number of bits. It can be improved by using a different quantization codebook per layer. Further improvement can be done by applying different precisions to different parameters, with higher precision for particularly important parameters (\"outlier weights\"). See the visual guide to quantization by Maarten Grootendorst for a visual depiction.\nWhile quantized models are typically frozen, and only pre-quantized models are fine-tuned, quantized models can still be fine-tuned.Multimodality\nMultimodality means \"having several modalities\", and a \"modality\" refers to a type of input or output, such as video, image, audio, text, proprioception, etc. There have been many AI models trained specifically to ingest one modality and output another modality, such as AlexNet for image to label, visual question answering for image-text to text, and speech recognition for speech to text.\nA common method to create multimodal models out of an LLM is to \"tokenize\" the output of a trained encoder. Concretely, one can construct an LLM that can understand images as follows: take a trained LLM, and take a trained image encoder \n  \n    \n      \n        E\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle E}\n  \n. Make a small multilayered perceptron \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f}\n  \n, so that for any image \n  \n    \n      \n        y\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle y}\n  \n, the post-processed vector \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        (\n        E\n        (\n        y\n        )\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f(E(y))}\n  \n has the same dimensions as an encoded token. That is an \"image token\". Then, one can interleave text tokens and image tokens. The compound model is then fine-tuned on an image-text dataset. This basic construction can be applied with more sophistication to improve the model. The image encoder may be frozen to improve stability.\nFlamingo demonstrated the effectiveness of the tokenization method, finetuning a pair of pretrained language model and image encoder to perform better on visual question answering than models trained from scratch. Google PaLM model was fine-tuned into a multimodal model PaLM-E using the tokenization method, and applied to robotic control. LLaMA models have also been turned multimodal using the tokenization method, to allow image inputs, and video inputs.\nGPT-4 can use both text and image as inputs (although the vision component was not released to the public until GPT-4V); Google DeepMind's Gemini is also multimodal.  Mistral introduced its own multimodel Pixtral 12B model in September 2024.Reasoning\nIn late 2024, a new direction emerged in LLM development with models specifically designed for complex reasoning tasks. These \"reasoning models\" were trained to spend more time generating step-by-step solutions before providing final answers, similar to human problem-solving processes.\nOpenAI introduced this trend with their o1 model in September 2024, followed by o3 in December 2024. These models showed significant improvements in mathematics, science, and coding tasks compared to traditional LLMs. For example, on International Mathematics Olympiad qualifying exam problems, GPT-4o achieved 13% accuracy while o1 reached 83%.\nIn January 2025, the Chinese company DeepSeek released DeepSeek-R1, a 671-billion-parameter open-weight reasoning model that achieved comparable performance to OpenAI's o1 while being significantly more cost-effective to operate. Unlike proprietary models from OpenAI, DeepSeek-R1's open-weight nature allowed researchers to study and build upon the algorithm, though its training data remained private.\nThese reasoning models typically require more computational resources per query compared to traditional LLMs, as they perform more extensive processing to work through problems step-by-step. However, they have shown superior capabilities in domains requiring structured logical thinking, such as mathematics, scientific research, and computer programming.\nEfforts to reduce or compensate for hallucinations have employed automated reasoning, RAG (retrieval-augmented generation), fine-tuning, and other methods.Properties\nScaling laws\nThe performance of an LLM after pretraining largely depends on the:\n\ncost of pretraining \n  \n    \n      \n        C\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle C}\n  \n (the total amount of compute used),\nsize of the artificial neural network itself, such as number of parameters \n  \n    \n      \n        N\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle N}\n  \n (i.e. amount of neurons in its layers, amount of weights between them and biases),\nsize of its pretraining dataset (i.e. number of tokens in corpus, \n  \n    \n      \n        D\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle D}\n  \n).\n\"Scaling laws\" are empirical statistical laws that predict LLM performance based on such factors. One particular scaling law (\"Chinchilla scaling\") for LLM autoregressively trained for one epoch, with a log-log learning rate schedule, states that:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            {\n            \n              \n                \n                  C\n                  =\n                  \n                    C\n                    \n                      0\n                    \n                  \n                  N\n                  D\n                \n              \n              \n                \n                  L\n                  =\n                  \n                    \n                      A\n                      \n                        N\n                        \n                          \u03b1\n                        \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                  +\n                  \n                    \n                      B\n                      \n                        D\n                        \n                          \u03b2\n                        \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                  +\n                  \n                    L\n                    \n                      0\n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\begin{cases}C=C_{0}ND\\\\[6pt]L={\\frac {A}{N^{\\alpha }}}+{\\frac {B}{D^{\\beta }}}+L_{0}\\end{cases}}}\n  \n where the variables are\n\n  \n    \n      \n        C\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle C}\n  \n is the cost of training the model, in FLOPs.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        N\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle N}\n  \n is the number of parameters in the model.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        D\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle D}\n  \n is the number of tokens in the training set.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        L\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle L}\n  \n is the average negative log-likelihood loss per token (nats/token), achieved by the trained LLM on the test dataset.\nand the statistical hyper-parameters are\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          C\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n        =\n        6\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle C_{0}=6}\n  \n, meaning that it costs 6 FLOPs per parameter to train on one token.

However, this linearity may be punctuated by \"break(s)\" in the scaling law, where the slope of the line changes abruptly, and where larger models acquire \"emergent abilities\". They arise from the complex interaction of the model's components and are not explicitly programmed or designed. \nFurthermore, recent research has demonstrated that AI systems, including large language models, can employ heuristic reasoning akin to human cognition. They balance between exhaustive logical processing and the use of cognitive shortcuts (heuristics), adapting their reasoning strategies to optimize between accuracy and effort. This behavior aligns with principles of resource-rational human cognition, as discussed in classical theories of bounded rationality and dual-process theory.\nOne of the emergent abilities is in-context learning from example demonstrations. In-context learning is involved in tasks, such as:\n\nreported arithmetics\ndecoding the International Phonetic Alphabet\nunscrambling a word's letters\ndisambiguating word-in-context datasets\nconverting spatial words\ncardinal directions (for example, replying \"northeast\" in response to a 3x3 grid of 8 zeros and a 1 in the top-right), color terms represented in text.\nchain-of-thought prompting: In a 2022 research paper, chain-of-thought prompting only improved the performance for models that had at least 62B. Smaller models perform better when prompted to answer immediately, without chain of thought.\nidentifying offensive content in paragraphs of Hinglish (a combination of Hindi and English), and generating a similar English equivalent of Kiswahili proverbs.\nSchaeffer et. al. argue that the emergent abilities are not unpredictably acquired, but predictably acquired according to a smooth scaling law. The authors considered a toy statistical model of an LLM solving multiple-choice questions, and showed that this statistical model, modified to account for other types of tasks, applies to these tasks as well.\nLet \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x}\n  \n be the number of parameter count, and \n  \n    \n      \n        y\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle y}\n  \n be the performance of the model.Interpretation\nLarge language models by themselves are black boxes, and it is not clear how they can perform linguistic tasks. Similarly, it is unclear if or how LLMs should be viewed as models of the human brain and/or human mind.\nVarious techniques have been developed to enhance the transparency and interpretability of LLMs. Mechanistic interpretability aims to reverse-engineer LLMs by discovering symbolic algorithms that approximate the inference performed by an LLM. In recent years, sparse coding models such as sparse autoencoders, transcoders, and crosscoders have emerged as promising tools for identifying interpretable features.Studying a replacement model\nTranscoders, which are more interpretable than transformers, have been utilized to develop \u201creplacement models.\u201d In one such study involving the mechanistic interpretation of writing a rhyming poem by an LLM, it was shown that although they are believed to simply predict the next token, they can, in fact, plan ahead.Explainability\nA related concept is AI explainability, which focuses on understanding how an AI model arrives at a given result. Techniques such as partial dependency plots, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), and feature importance assessments allow researchers to visualize and understand the contributions of various input features to the model's predictions. These methods help ensure that AI models make decisions based on relevant and fair criteria, enhancing trust and accountability.\nBy integrating these techniques, researchers and practitioners can gain deeper insights into the operations of LLMs, fostering trust and facilitating the responsible deployment of these powerful models.\nIn another example, the authors trained small transformers on modular arithmetic addition. The resulting models were reverse-engineered, and it turned out they used discrete Fourier transform.Understanding and intelligence\nNLP researchers were evenly split when asked, in a 2022 survey, whether (untuned) LLMs \"could (ever) understand natural language in some nontrivial sense\". Proponents of \"LLM understanding\" believe that some LLM abilities, such as mathematical reasoning, imply an ability to \"understand\" certain concepts. A Microsoft team argued in 2023 that GPT-4 \"can solve novel and difficult tasks that span mathematics, coding, vision, medicine, law, psychology and more\" and that GPT-4 \"could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence system\": \"Can one reasonably say that a system that passes exams for software engineering candidates is not really intelligent?\" Ilya Sutskever argues that predicting the next word sometimes involves reasoning and deep insights, for example if the LLM has to predict the name of the criminal in an unknown detective novel after processing the entire story leading up to the revelation. Some researchers characterize LLMs as \"alien intelligence\". For example, Conjecture CEO Connor Leahy considers untuned LLMs to be like inscrutable alien \"Shoggoths\", and believes that RLHF tuning creates a \"smiling facade\" obscuring the inner workings of the LLM: \"If you don't push it too far, the smiley face stays on. But then you give it [an unexpected] prompt, and suddenly you see this massive underbelly of insanity, of weird thought processes and clearly non-human understanding.\"\nIn contrast, some skeptics of LLM understanding believe that existing LLMs are \"simply remixing and recombining existing writing\", a phenomenon known as stochastic parrot, or they point to the deficits existing LLMs continue to have in prediction skills, reasoning skills, agency, and explainability. For example, GPT-4 has natural deficits in planning and in real-time learning. Generative LLMs have been observed to confidently assert claims of fact which do not seem to be justified by their training data, a phenomenon which has been termed \"hallucination\". Specifically, hallucinations in the context of LLMs correspond to the generation of text or responses that seem syntactically sound, fluent, and natural but are factually incorrect, nonsensical, or unfaithful to the provided source input. Neuroscientist Terrence Sejnowski has argued that \"The diverging opinions of experts on the intelligence of LLMs suggests that our old ideas based on natural intelligence are inadequate\".\nThe matter of LLM's exhibiting intelligence or understanding has two main aspects \u2013 the first is how to model thought and language in a computer system, and the second is how to enable the computer system to generate human like language. These aspects of language as a model of cognition have been developed in the field of cognitive linguistics. American linguist George Lakoff presented Neural Theory of Language (NTL) as a computational basis for using language as a model of learning tasks and understanding. The NTL Model outlines how specific neural structures of the human brain shape the nature of thought and language and in turn what are the computational properties of such neural systems that can be applied to model thought and language in a computer system. After a framework for modeling language in a computer systems was established, the focus shifted to establishing frameworks for computer systems to generate language with acceptable grammar. In his 2014 book titled The Language Myth: Why Language Is Not An Instinct, British cognitive linguist and digital communication technologist Vyvyan Evans mapped out the role of probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG) in enabling NLP to model cognitive patterns and generate human like language.Evaluation\nPerplexity\nThe canonical measure of the performance of an LLM is its perplexity on a given text corpus. Perplexity measures how well a model predicts the contents of a dataset; the higher the likelihood the model assigns to the dataset, the lower the perplexity. In mathematical terms, perplexity is the exponential of the average negative log likelihood per token.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        log\n        \u2061\n        (\n        \n          Perplexity\n        \n        )\n        =\n        \u2212\n        \n          \n            1\n            N\n          \n        \n        \n          \u2211\n          \n            i\n            =\n            1\n          \n          \n            N\n          \n        \n        log\n        \u2061\n        (\n        Pr\n        (\n        \n          \n            token\n          \n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        \u2223\n        \n          \n            context for token\n          \n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        )\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\log({\\text{Perplexity}})=-{\\frac {1}{N}}\\sum _{i=1}^{N}\\log(\\Pr({\\text{token}}_{i}\\mid {\\text{context for token}}_{i}))}\n  \n\nHere, \n  \n    \n      \n        N\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle N}\n  \n is the number of tokens in the text corpus, and \"context for token \n  \n    \n      \n        i\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i}\n  \n\" depends on the specific type of LLM. If the LLM is autoregressive, then \"context for token \n  \n    \n      \n        i\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i}\n  \n\" is the segment of text appearing before token \n  \n    \n      \n        i\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i}\n  \n. If the LLM is masked, then \"context for token \n  \n    \n      \n        i\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i}\n  \n\" is the segment of text surrounding token \n  \n    \n      \n        i\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i}\n  \n.\nBecause language models may overfit to training data, models are usually evaluated by their perplexity on a test set. This evaluation is potentially problematic for larger models which, as they are trained on increasingly large corpora of text, are increasingly likely to inadvertently include portions of any given test set.BPW, BPC, and BPT\nIn information theory, the concept of entropy is intricately linked to perplexity, a relationship notably established by Claude Shannon. This relationship is mathematically expressed as \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          Entropy\n        \n        =\n        \n          log\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        \u2061\n        (\n        \n          Perplexity\n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\text{Entropy}}=\\log _{2}({\\text{Perplexity}})}\n  \n.\nEntropy, in this context, is commonly quantified in terms of bits per word (BPW) or bits per character (BPC), which hinges on whether the language model utilizes word-based or character-based tokenization.\nNotably, in the case of larger language models that predominantly employ sub-word tokenization, bits per token (BPT) emerges as a seemingly more appropriate measure. However, due to the variance in tokenization methods across different Large Language Models (LLMs), BPT does not serve as a reliable metric for comparative analysis among diverse models. To convert BPT into BPW, one can multiply it by the average number of tokens per word.\nIn the evaluation and comparison of language models, cross-entropy is generally the preferred metric over entropy. The underlying principle is that a lower BPW is indicative of a model's enhanced capability for compression. This, in turn, reflects the model's proficiency in making accurate predictions.Task-specific datasets and benchmarks\nA large number of testing datasets and benchmarks have also been developed to evaluate the capabilities of language models on more specific downstream tasks. Tests may be designed to evaluate a variety of capabilities, including general knowledge, bias, commonsense reasoning, and mathematical problem-solving.\nOne broad category of evaluation dataset is question answering datasets, consisting of pairs of questions and correct answers, for example, (\"Have the San Jose Sharks won the Stanley Cup?\", \"No\"). A question answering task is considered \"open book\" if the model's prompt includes text from which the expected answer can be derived (for example, the previous question could be adjoined with some text which includes the sentence \"The Sharks have advanced to the Stanley Cup finals once, losing to the Pittsburgh Penguins in 2016.\"). Otherwise, the task is considered \"closed book\", and the model must draw on knowledge retained during training. Some examples of commonly used question answering datasets include TruthfulQA, Web Questions, TriviaQA, and SQuAD.\nEvaluation datasets may also take the form of text completion, having the model select the most likely word or sentence to complete a prompt, for example: \"Alice was friends with Bob. Alice went to visit her friend, ____\".\nSome composite benchmarks have also been developed which combine a diversity of different evaluation datasets and tasks. Examples include GLUE, SuperGLUE, MMLU, BIG-bench, HELM, and HLE (Humanity's Last Exam). OpenAI has released tools for running composite benchmarks, but noted that the eval results are sensitive to the prompting method. Some public datasets contain questions that are mislabeled, ambiguous, unanswerable, or otherwise of low-quality, which can be cleaned to give more reliable benchmark scores.\nBias in LLMs may be measured through benchmarks such as CrowS-Pairs (Crowdsourced Stereotype Pairs), Stereo Set, and the more recent Parity Benchmark.  Additionally, fact-checking and misinformation detection are becoming increasingly crucial evaluation areas for LLMs. A recent study by Caramancion (2023) compared the fact-checking accuracy of prominent LLMs\u2014including OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT 3.5 and 4.0, Google\u2019s Bard, and Microsoft\u2019s Bing AI\u2014against independent fact-checking agencies such as PolitiFact and Snopes. The results demonstrated a moderate proficiency in fact verification, with GPT-4 achieving the highest accuracy at 71%, but still lagging behind human fact-checkers in contextual comprehension and nuanced reasoning. This underscores the evolving but incomplete ability of LLMs to discern fact from deception, highlighting the need for continued advancements in AI-driven fact-checking methodologies.\nIt was previously standard to report results on a heldout portion of an evaluation dataset after doing supervised fine-tuning on the remainder. It is now more common to evaluate a pre-trained model directly through prompting techniques, though researchers vary in the details of how they formulate prompts for particular tasks, particularly with respect to how many examples of solved tasks are adjoined to the prompt (i.e. the value of n in n-shot prompting).Adversarially constructed evaluations\nBecause of the rapid pace of improvement of large language models, evaluation benchmarks have suffered from short lifespans, with state of the art models quickly \"saturating\" existing benchmarks, exceeding the performance of human annotators, leading to efforts to replace or augment the benchmark with more challenging tasks. In addition, there are cases of \"shortcut learning\" wherein AIs sometimes \"cheat\" on multiple-choice tests by using statistical correlations in superficial test question wording in order to guess the correct responses, without necessarily understanding the actual question being asked.\nSome datasets have been constructed adversarially, focusing on particular problems on which extant language models seem to have unusually poor performance compared to humans. One example is the TruthfulQA dataset, a question answering dataset consisting of 817 questions which language models are susceptible to answering incorrectly by mimicking falsehoods to which they were repeatedly exposed during training. For example, an LLM may answer \"No\" to the question \"Can you teach an old dog new tricks?\" because of its exposure to the English idiom you can't teach an old dog new tricks, even though this is not literally true.\nAnother example of an adversarial evaluation dataset is Swag and its successor, HellaSwag, collections of problems in which one of multiple options must be selected to complete a text passage. The incorrect completions were generated by sampling from a language model and filtering with a set of classifiers. The resulting problems are trivial for humans but at the time the datasets were created state of the art language models had poor accuracy on them. For example:\n\nWe see a fitness center sign. We then see a man talking to the camera and sitting and laying on a exercise ball. The man...\na) demonstrates how to increase efficient exercise work by running up and down balls.\nb) moves all his arms and legs and builds up a lot of muscle.\nc) then plays the ball and we see a graphics and hedge trimming demonstration.\nd) performs sit ups while on the ball and talking.\n\nBERT selects b) as the most likely completion, though the correct answer is d).Limitations of LLM benchmarks\nBenchmarks can become outdated rapidly. Once a model attains near-perfect scores on a given benchmark, that benchmark ceases to serve as a meaningful indicator of progress. This phenomenon, known as \"benchmark saturation,\" necessitates the development of more challenging and nuanced tasks to continue advancing LLM capabilities. For instance, traditional benchmarks like HellaSwag and MMLU have seen models achieving high accuracy already.Wider impact\nIn 2023, Nature Biomedical Engineering wrote that \"it is no longer possible to accurately distinguish\" human-written text from text created by large language models, and that \"It is all but certain that general-purpose large language models will rapidly proliferate... It is a rather safe bet that they will change many industries over time.\" Goldman Sachs suggested in 2023 that generative language AI could increase global GDP by 7% in the next ten years, and could expose to automation 300 million jobs globally. Brinkmann et al. (2023) also argue that LLMs are transforming processes of cultural evolution by shaping processes of variation, transmission, and selection.Memorization and copyright\nMemorization is an emergent behavior in LLMs in which long strings of text are occasionally output verbatim from training data, contrary to typical behavior of traditional artificial neural nets. Evaluations of controlled LLM output measure the amount memorized from training data (focused on GPT-2-series models) as variously over 1% for exact duplicates or up to about 7%.\nA 2023 study showed that when ChatGPT 3.5 turbo was prompted to repeat the same word indefinitely, after a few hundreds of repetitions, it would start outputting excerpts from its training data.Security\nSome commenters expressed concern over accidental or deliberate creation of misinformation, or other forms of misuse. For example, the availability of large language models could reduce the skill-level required to commit bioterrorism; biosecurity researcher Kevin Esvelt has suggested that LLM creators should exclude from their training data papers on creating or enhancing pathogens.\nThe potential presence of \"sleeper agents\" within LLMs is another emerging security concern. These are hidden functionalities built into the model that remain dormant until triggered by a specific event or condition. Upon activation, the LLM deviates from its expected behavior to make insecure actions.\nLLM applications accessible to the public, like ChatGPT or Claude, typically incorporate safety measures designed to filter out harmful content. However, implementing these controls effectively has proven challenging. For instance, a 2023 study proposed a method for circumventing LLM safety systems. In 2025, The American Sunlight Project, a non-profit, published a study showing evidence that the so-called Pravda network, a pro-Russia propaganda aggregator, was strategically placing web content through mass publication and duplication with the intention of biasing LLM outputs. The American Sunlight Project coined this technique \"LLM grooming,\" and pointed to it as a new tool of weaponizing AI to spread disinformation and harmful content. Similarly, Yongge Wang illustrated in 2024 how a potential criminal could potentially bypass ChatGPT 4o's safety controls to obtain information on establishing a drug trafficking operation.Algorithmic bias\nWhile LLMs have shown remarkable capabilities in generating human-like text, they are susceptible to inheriting and amplifying biases present in their training data. This can manifest in skewed representations or unfair treatment of different demographics, such as those based on race, gender, language, and cultural groups. Since English data is overrepresented in current large language models' training data, it may also downplay non-English views.Stereotyping\nAI models can reinforce a wide range of stereotypes, including those based on gender, ethnicity, age, nationality, religion, or occupation. This can lead to outputs that homogenize, or unfairly generalize or caricature groups of people, sometimes in harmful or derogatory ways.\nNotably, gender bias refers to the tendency of these models to produce outputs that are unfairly prejudiced towards one gender over another. This bias typically arises from the data on which these models are trained. Large language models often assign roles and characteristics based on traditional gender norms. For example, it might associate nurses or secretaries predominantly with women and engineers or CEOs with men.Selection bias\nSelection bias refers the inherent tendency of large language models to favor certain option identifiers irrespective of the actual content of the options. This bias primarily stems from token bias\u2014that is, the model assigns a higher a priori probability to specific answer tokens (such as \u201cA\u201d) when generating responses. As a result, when the ordering of options is altered (for example, by systematically moving the correct answer to different positions), the model\u2019s performance can fluctuate significantly. This phenomenon undermines the reliability of large language models in multiple-choice settings.Political bias\nPolitical bias refers to the tendency of algorithms to systematically favor certain political viewpoints, ideologies, or outcomes over others. Language models may also exhibit political biases. Since the training data includes a wide range of political opinions and coverage, the models might generate responses that lean towards particular political ideologies or viewpoints, depending on the prevalence of those views in the data.Energy demands\nThe energy demands of LLMs have grown along with their size and capabilities. Data centers that enable LLM training require substantial amounts of electricity. Much of that electricity is generated by non-renewable resources that create greenhouse gases and contribute to climate change. Nuclear power and geothermal energy are two options tech companies are exploring to meet the sizable energy demands of LLM training. The significant expense of investing in geothermal solutions has led to major shale producers like Chevron and Exxon Mobil advocating for tech companies to use electricity produced via natural gas to fuel their large energy demands.See also\nFoundation models\nList of large language models\nList of chatbots\nLanguage model benchmark\nSmall language modelReferences\nFurther reading\nJurafsky, Dan, Martin, James.

LLMs can then be fine-tuned for specific tasks through supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), among other methods. The most advanced LLMs are capable of performing a wide range of tasks and can even write code. These models can be fine-tuned for specific tasks such as writing code, creating art, or playing games.\n\nHistory\n\nThe history of LLMs dates back to IBM alignment models in the 1990s, which pioneered statistical language modeling. In the 2000s, the rise of the internet provided a wealth of data for statistical language models, and by 2001, a smoothed n-gram model was the state-of-the-art model for language modeling. Around this time, statistical language models became dominant in language modeling, and by 2009, they had largely replaced older models. However, despite their dominance, these models were not able to produce coherent text on their own; this would not be achieved until the advent of neural network-based language models.\n\nIn 2014, Google Brain introduced neural network-based language models, which were superior to statistical language models. However, they were not widely adopted due to their inability to capture long-range dependencies. Around this time, several other neural network-based language models were proposed, but none were able to effectively capture long-range dependencies. In 2017, the transformer architecture was introduced in the influential paper \"Attention Is All You Need\", which led to the widespread adoption of transformer-based language models. This architecture enabled models to effectively capture long-range dependencies, and by 2018, transformer-based language models had largely replaced older neural network-based models. Since then, the development of transformer-based LLMs has continued to advance, with models becoming larger and more powerful.\n\nThe most advanced LLMs are now capable of performing a wide range of tasks and can even write code. These models can be fine-tuned for specific tasks such as writing code, creating art, or playing games.\n\n Dataset preprocessing\n\nLLMs are trained on massive datasets consisting of large amounts of text. The process of preparing this data for training is called dataset preprocessing. It typically involves data collection, data cleaning, data annotation, data normalization, and data splitting.\n\n Tokenization\n\nTokenization is the process of converting text into numbers that machine learning models can understand. In LLMs, text is converted into tokens, which are small units of text (such as words or subwords) that are assigned unique integer IDs. These IDs are then used as input to the model.\n\nThe first step in tokenization is to select a vocabulary. The vocabulary is a set of unique tokens that will be used to represent the text. There are two main types of tokenization: word-level tokenization and subword-level tokenization. Word-level tokenization involves breaking the text into individual words, while subword-level tokenization involves breaking the text into smaller units such as characters or subwords.\n\nOnce a vocabulary has been selected, the text is split into tokens using a tokenizer. The tokenizer is a tool that converts the text into tokens. There are many different tokenizers available, and the choice of tokenizer depends on the specific task and the type of model being used.\n\nAfter the text has been tokenized, it must be converted into a format that the model can understand. This is done using a process called index assignment, where each token is assigned a unique integer ID. The resulting sequence of IDs is then fed into the model.\n\nIn addition to index assignment, tokenization also involves padding and truncation. Padding is used to ensure that all sequences have the same length, while truncation is used to limit the length of the sequences. This is necessary because LLMs have a limited context window, meaning that they can only process a fixed number of tokens at a time.\n\n--- BPE\n\nByte-Pair Encoding (BPE) is a popular algorithm used for tokenization in LLMs. BPE is a type of subword-level tokenization, which means that it breaks the text into smaller units such as characters or subwords.\n\nThe BPE algorithm works by creating a dictionary of the most frequent co-occurrences of bytes in the text. For example, if the text \"the quick brown fox\" is being tokenized, the co-occurrences \"th\", \"he\", \"e \", \" qu\", \"qui\", \"ic\", \"cb\", \"br\", \"ro\", \"wn\", \" fox\" would be counted. The algorithm then iteratively merges the most frequent co-occurrences into new tokens. In the first iteration, \"th\" and \"he\" might be merged into \"he\", resulting in the new token \"he\". In the second iteration, \"he\" and \" e\" might be merged into \"he\", resulting in the new token \"he\". This process continues until a predetermined number of tokens has been reached.\n\nThe advantage of BPE is that it can handle out-of-vocabulary words by breaking them down into subwords that have been seen during training. This makes BPE a flexible and effective tokenization method for LLMs.\n\n--- Special tokens\n\nLLMs often require special tokens to be added to the token vocabulary. These tokens include control tokens, which allow the model to perform different tasks depending on the token used, and classification tokens, which are used to classify the type of token used. Additionally, LLMs may require special tokens for tasks such as text summarization or question answering.\n\n Problems\n\nTokenization can pose challenges for non-English languages. The main issue is that tokenizers are usually optimized for English, which can lead to inefficient processing of other languages. For example, a tokenizer might split a word into individual characters instead of whole words, which can make it difficult for the model to understand the meaning of the word.\n\nAnother challenge is that some languages do not have a clear distinction between words, making it difficult to determine where one word ends and the next begins. This can lead to inefficient processing and poor performance of the model.\n\nCase study: Shan language from Myanmar\n\nThe Shan language, spoken primarily in northern Thailand and northeastern Myanmar, poses a particular challenge for tokenization due to its complex structure and limited availability of language data. Unlike many European languages, Shan is a tonal language with a large number of monosyllabic words, which can make it difficult to determine word boundaries. Additionally, the language uses a combination of consonant and vowel sounds, which can further complicate tokenization.\n\nIn a study published in 2022, researchers from Thailand's Chiang Mai University and the United States' Purdue University found that the GPT-2 tokenizer, which is optimized for English, was unable to correctly tokenize Shan text. The researchers attempted to improve tokenization performance by training a new tokenizer on a dataset of 1 million Shan words, but even this approach only achieved an accuracy of around 80%. The researchers concluded that more work is needed to develop effective tokenization methods for low-resource languages like Shan.\n\n Dataset cleaning\n\nThe cleaning of datasets for LLMs includes removing low-quality data, duplicates, and toxic data. However, cleaning data can reduce the amount of training data available, so researchers are exploring methods to clean data while still preserving the overall quantity. One promising approach is to use another LLM to clean the data.\n\n--- Synthetic data\n\nWhile the amount of naturally occurring linguistic data is limited, there is no upper bound on the amount of synthetic data that can be generated. The idea behind synthetic data is to use a trained LLM to generate new data that is similar to the original data. This can be useful for creating additional training data or for augmenting existing data.\n\nOne example of synthetic data for LLMs is the use of textbooks to generate textbook-like data. By having the LLM generate text that resembles a textbook, it can be used to teach new concepts or to review material.\n\n--- Synthetic data generation\n\nThe generation of synthetic data for LLMs involves using the LLM itself to generate new data. This can be done by giving the LLM a prompt and letting it generate text based on that prompt. The generated text can then be used as additional training data.\n\nThere are several benefits to using synthetic data for LLMs. First, it can be used to augment existing data, which can help to improve the performance of the model. Second, it can be used to create new data that is similar to the original data, which can be useful for creating additional training data. Finally, synthetic data can be used to generate data that is difficult or impossible to obtain through other means.\n\n--- Synthetic data generation methods\n\nThere are several methods for generating synthetic data for LLMs. One common method is to use a technique called data augmentation, which involves modifying existing data to create new examples. This can be done by adding noise to the data, changing the order of the data, or by using other techniques to alter the data while preserving its essential characteristics.\n\nAnother method for generating synthetic data is to use a technique called data synthesis. This involves using a model to generate new data that is similar to the original data. The model is trained on the original data and then used to generate new examples. This can be done using a variety of techniques, including generative adversarial networks (GANs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs).\n\n--- Synthetic data generation with textbooks\n\nTextbooks are a valuable source of information for LLMs, as they contain a wealth of knowledge on a wide range of topics. By incorporating textbook-like data into the training process, LLMs can learn to generate text that is more like a textbook and thus better suited for educational purposes.\n\nOne way to generate synthetic textbook data is to use a technique called data synthesis. This involves using a model to generate new data that is similar to the original data. The model is trained on the original data and then used to generate new examples. This can be done using a variety of techniques, including generative adversarial networks (GANs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs).\n\nAnother way to generate synthetic textbook data is to use a technique called data augmentation. This involves modifying existing data to create new examples. This can be done by adding noise to the data, changing the order of the data, or by using other techniques to alter the data while preserving its essential characteristics.\n\n Training and architecture\n\nLLMs are typically trained using supervised learning, unsupervised learning, or reinforcement learning. The most common approach is to use a combination of these methods.\n\nSupervised learning is used to teach the model to map inputs to outputs. For example, the model might be given a sentence and asked to predict the next word in the sentence. Unsupervised learning is used to teach the model to learn the underlying structure of the data. For example, the model might be given a large corpus of text and asked to learn the patterns in the text. Reinforcement learning is used to teach the model to make decisions. For example, the model might be given a game and asked to learn how to play the game.\n\nThe architecture of LLMs is based on the transformer architecture, which was introduced in the influential paper \"Attention Is All You Need\". The transformer architecture consists of a series of layers, each of which contains a self-attention mechanism and a feed-forward neural network. The self-attention mechanism allows the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence, while the feed-forward neural network allows the model to learn complex relationships between the input and output sequences.\n\n--- Training and inference\n\nLLMs are trained using a process called backpropagation, which is a standard technique for training neural networks. During training, the model is presented with a sequence of tokens, and it generates a probability distribution over the next token in the sequence. The model's predictions are compared to the actual next token in the sequence, and the difference between the two is used to update the model's parameters.\n\nDuring inference, the model is presented with a sequence of tokens, and it generates a probability distribution over the next token in the sequence. The token with the highest probability is then added to the sequence, and the process is repeated.\n\n--- Training and inference speed\n\nThe speed of training and inference is an important consideration when working with LLMs. The size of the model and the amount of data being processed can have a significant impact on the speed of training and inference. In general, larger models and more data will result in slower training and inference times.\n\nThere are several techniques that can be used to speed up training and inference. One technique is to use a technique called quantization, which reduces the precision of the model's parameters. This can reduce the amount of memory required to store the model and can also reduce the amount of computation required to process the model.\n\nAnother technique is to use a technique called pruning, which removes unnecessary parameters from the model. This can reduce the size of the model and can also reduce the amount of computation required to process the model.\n\n--- Training and inference hardware\n\nThe hardware used for training and inference can have a significant impact on the speed of the process. For training, the most common approach is to use a GPU, as GPUs are well-suited for the parallel computations required by deep learning models. For inference, the most common approach is to use a CPU, as CPUs are well-suited for the sequential computations required by deep learning models.\n\n--- Training and inference efficiency\n\nThe efficiency of training and inference can be improved by using techniques such as quantization and pruning. These techniques can reduce the size of the model and can also reduce the amount of computation required to process the model. Another technique that can be used to improve efficiency is to use a technique called knowledge distillation, which involves training a smaller model to imitate the behavior of a larger model.\n\n Reinforcement learning from human feedback\n\nReinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is a technique for training LLMs using feedback from humans. The basic idea behind RLHF is to use a reward model to evaluate the output of the LLM and to use this evaluation to train the LLM to generate better output.\n\nThe reward model is a separate model that is used to evaluate the output of the LLM. The reward model is trained using labeled data, where each example consists of an input to the LLM and a label indicating whether the output of the LLM was good or bad. Once the reward model is trained, it can be used to evaluate the output of the LLM and to provide feedback to the LLM.\n\nRLHF has several advantages over other methods for training LLMs. First, it allows for the incorporation of human feedback, which can be valuable for ensuring that the LLM generates output that is useful and appropriate. Second, RLHF can be used to train LLMs on tasks where it is difficult to define a loss function, such as tasks where the goal is to generate text that is similar to human-written text.\n\n Instruction tuning\n\nInstruction tuning is a technique for fine-tuning LLMs using human-provided instructions. The basic idea behind instruction tuning is to provide the LLM with a set of instructions and a set of examples, and to use this information to fine-tune the LLM.\n\nThe instructions are used to specify the desired behavior of the LLM, and the examples are used to provide the LLM with a set of inputs and corresponding outputs. The LLM is then fine-tuned using a technique such as supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning from human feedback.\n\nInstruction tuning has several advantages over other methods for fine-tuning LLMs. First, it allows for the incorporation of human-provided instructions, which can be valuable for ensuring that the LLM generates output that is useful and appropriate. Second, instruction tuning can be used to fine-tune LLMs on tasks where it is difficult to define a loss function, such as tasks where the goal is to generate text that is similar to human-written text.\n\n--- Self-instruct\n\nSelf-instruct is a technique for fine-tuning LLMs using a self-instruction approach. The basic idea behind self-instruct is to provide the LLM with a set of instructions and a set of examples, and to use this information to fine-tune the LLM.\n\nThe instructions are used to specify the desired behavior of the LLM, and the examples are used to provide the LLM with a set of inputs and corresponding outputs. The LLM is then fine-tuned using a technique such as supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning from human feedback.\n\nThe self-instruct approach has several advantages over other methods for fine-tuning LLMs. First, it allows for the incorporation of human-provided instructions, which can be valuable for ensuring that the LLM generates output that is useful and appropriate. Second, self-instruct can be used to fine-tune LLMs on tasks where it is difficult to define a loss function, such as tasks where the goal is to generate text that is similar to human-written text.\n\n Mixture of experts\n\nMixture of experts (MoE) is a technique for improving the performance of LLMs by combining multiple smaller models. The basic idea behind MoE is to divide the problem into smaller subproblems and to use a separate model to solve each subproblem.\n\nEach model in the mixture of experts is called an \"expert\". The experts are combined using a gating network, which determines the weight of each expert for a given input. The output of the mixture of experts is the weighted sum of the outputs of the experts.\n\nMoE has several advantages over other techniques for improving the performance of LLMs. First, it allows for the use of smaller models, which can be easier to train and can also be less computationally expensive. Second, MoE can improve the performance of the LLM on tasks where the input is divided into multiple subproblems.\n\n Prompt engineering, attention mechanism, and context window\n\nPrompt engineering is a technique for fine-tuning LLMs using carefully crafted prompts. The basic idea behind prompt engineering is to provide the LLM with a prompt that specifies the desired behavior of the LLM, and to use this prompt to guide the LLM's output.\n\nThe prompt is a string of text that is provided to the LLM as input. The prompt can include a variety of information, such as the task that the LLM should perform, the desired output format, and any other relevant information. The prompt is used to guide the LLM's output, and the LLM is trained to generate output that is consistent with the prompt.\n\nPrompt engineering has several advantages over other techniques for fine-tuning LLMs. First, it allows for the incorporation of human-provided information, which can be valuable for ensuring that the LLM generates output that is useful and appropriate. Second, prompt engineering can be used to fine-tune LLMs on tasks where it is difficult to define a loss function, such as tasks where the goal is to generate text that is similar to human-written text.\n\n--- Attention mechanism\n\nThe attention mechanism is a key component of LLMs. The attention mechanism allows the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence, which enables the model to learn the relationships between the input and output sequences.\n\nThe attention mechanism works by computing a weighted sum of the input sequence, where the weights are determined by the similarity between the input sequence and a set of query vectors. The query vectors are computed using the current state of the model, and they represent the part of the input sequence that the model is currently attending to.\n\n--- Context window\n\nThe context window is the number of tokens that the LLM can remember at a given time. The context window is an important limitation of LLMs, as it restricts the number of tokens that the LLM can remember at a given time.\n\nThe context window is determined by the architecture of the LLM. For example, the GPT-2 model has a context window of 1024 tokens, while the GPT-3 model has a context window of 2048 tokens.\n\nThe context window can be increased by using a technique called chunking. Chunking involves dividing the input sequence into smaller chunks and processing each chunk separately. The output of the LLM for each chunk is then concatenated to form the final output.\n\n--- Chat mode\n\nChat mode is a special mode of operation for LLMs that is designed for conversational tasks. In chat mode, the LLM is given a history of previous interactions and is expected to generate a response based on this history.\n\nThe history of previous interactions is stored in a buffer, and this buffer is used to provide the LLM with context for the current interaction. The LLM is then prompted to generate a response based on this context.\n\nChat mode is an important mode of operation for LLMs, as it allows the LLM to be used for conversational tasks such as chatbots and virtual assistants.\n\n Infrastructure\n\nThe training of LLMs requires substantial infrastructure, including powerful GPUs and TPUs, as well as high-speed networking. The training process can take weeks or months and requires large amounts of energy.\n\nTraining cost\n\nThe cost of training LLMs is a significant factor to consider. The cost of training a LLM depends on a variety of factors, including the size of the model, the amount of data being processed, and the hardware being used.\n\nThe size of the model is one of the most important factors affecting the cost of training a LLM. Larger models require more computational resources and take longer to train, which increases the cost of training. The amount of data being processed is also an important factor. More data requires more storage and more computation, which increases the cost of training. The hardware being used is also an important factor. Using more powerful hardware can reduce the cost of training, as it allows the model to be trained faster.\n\nThe cost of training a LLM can be significant. For example, training a 1.3 billion parameter model on a single TPUv4 can cost up to $70,000. The cost of training a LLM can be reduced by using smaller models, less data, or less powerful hardware.\n\n Tool use\n\nLLMs can be used to perform a wide range of tasks, including question answering, text completion, and text generation. However, LLMs are not able to solve every problem on their own. For example, LLMs are not able to perform mathematical calculations or retrieve information from the web.\n\nTo enable LLMs to perform tasks that they are not able to perform on their own, it is necessary to integrate them with other tools. For example, an LLM can be integrated with a calculator to perform mathematical calculations, or with a web browser to retrieve information from the web.\n\nThere are several ways to integrate LLMs with other tools. One common approach is to use a technique called tool prompting. Tool prompting involves providing the LLM with a list of available tools and instructions on how to use each tool. The LLM is then prompted to solve a problem, and it can choose the appropriate tool to use.\n\nAnother common approach is to use a technique called tool injection. Tool injection involves modifying the LLM to include the tools directly in the model. This allows the LLM to use the tools without having to be prompted to do so.\n\n--- Example: GPT-4 Turbo\n\nGPT-4 Turbo is a version of GPT-4 that has been modified to include a built-in calculator. When GPT-4 Turbo is prompted to perform a calculation, it uses the calculator to compute the answer.\n\nGPT-4 Turbo is an example of how LLMs can be extended to perform tasks beyond their original capabilities. By integrating the calculator into the model, GPT-4 Turbo is able to perform calculations that it would not be able to perform on its own.\n\n Agency\n\nLLMs are typically not considered to be agents, as they are not able to act in the world. However, it is possible to transform LLMs into agents by giving them the ability to act in the world. This can be done by adding modules to the LLM that allow it to interact with the world.\n\nThere are several different ways to transform LLMs into agents. One common approach is to use a technique called reinforcement learning. Reinforcement learning involves giving the agent a goal and allowing it to explore the world in order to learn how to achieve the goal. The agent receives feedback in the form of rewards, which it uses to learn how to achieve the goal.\n\nAnother common approach is to use a technique called imitation learning. Imitation learning involves giving the agent a set of demonstrations of the desired behavior and allowing the agent to learn how to imitate the demonstrations.\n\n--- ReAct pattern\n\nThe ReAct pattern is a technique for transforming LLMs into agents. The ReAct pattern adds a \"think\" step to the LLM, which allows the LLM to plan its actions before taking them.\n\nThe ReAct pattern works by inserting a \"think\" step between the LLM's output and its actions. The \"think\" step allows the LLM to plan its actions based on its current state and the desired goal.\n\nThe ReAct pattern has several advantages over other techniques for transforming LLMs into agents. First, it allows for the incorporation of planning, which can improve the agent's performance. Second, the ReAct pattern is relatively simple and can be easily implemented.\n\n--- DEPS method\n\nThe DEPS method is a technique for transforming LLMs into agents. The DEPS method adds a \"describe the environment\" step to the LLM, which allows the LLM to describe the current state of the world.\n\nThe DEPS method works by inserting a \"describe the environment\" step at the beginning of the agent's actions. The \"describe the environment\" step allows the LLM to describe the current state of the world, which provides the LLM with information about the current state of the world.\n\nThe DEPS method has several advantages over other techniques for transforming LLMs into agents. First, it allows for the incorporation of world knowledge, which can improve the agent's performance. Second, the DEPS method is relatively simple and can be easily implemented.\n\n--- Reflexion method\n\nThe Reflexion method is a technique for transforming LLMs into agents. The Reflexion method adds a \"reflect\" step to the LLM, which allows the LLM to reflect on its actions after taking them.\n\nThe Reflexion method works by inserting a \"reflect\" step after the LLM's actions. The \"reflect\" step allows the LLM to reflect on its actions and to adjust its behavior based on the results of its actions.\n\nThe Reflexion method has several advantages over other techniques for transforming LLMs into agents. First, it allows for the incorporation of reflection, which can improve the agent's performance. Second, the Reflexion method is relatively simple and can be easily implemented.\n\n Compression\n\nPost-training quantization is a technique for compressing LLMs. The basic idea behind post-training quantization is to reduce the precision of the model's parameters after the model has been trained.\n\nPost-training quantization has several advantages over other techniques for compressing LLMs. First, it does not require any modifications to the model's architecture, which means that the model can be compressed without affecting its performance. Second, post-training quantization is relatively simple and can be easily implemented.\n\n--- Simple quantization\n\nSimple quantization is a technique for compressing LLMs. The basic idea behind simple quantization is to replace the model's parameters with lower-precision representations.\n\nSimple quantization has several advantages over other techniques for compressing LLMs. First, it does not require any modifications to the model's architecture, which means that the model can be compressed without affecting its performance. Second, simple quantization is relatively simple and can be easily implemented.\n\n--- Group-wise quantization\n\nGroup-wise quantization is a technique for compressing LLMs. The basic idea behind group-wise quantization is to quantize the model's parameters in groups.\n\nGroup-wise quantization has several advantages over other techniques for compressing LLMs. First, it allows for the use of lower-precision representations, which can reduce the size of the model. Second, group-wise quantization can improve the performance of the model, as it allows for the use of more precise representations for the parameters that are most important for the model's performance.\n\n--- Weight pruning\n\nWeight pruning is a technique for compressing LLMs. The basic idea behind weight pruning is to remove unnecessary parameters from the model.\n\nWeight pruning has several advantages over other techniques for compressing LLMs. First, it can significantly reduce the size of the model, which can reduce the amount of storage required to store the model. Second, weight pruning can improve the performance of the model, as it removes parameters that are not contributing to the model's performance.\n\n Multimodality\n\nMultimodality is a field of artificial intelligence that deals with the integration of multiple modalities of data. In the context of LLMs, multimodality refers to the ability of LLMs to process and understand multiple types of data, such as text, images, and audio.\n\nLLMs can be extended to process multiple types of data by adding modules to the model that allow it to process the different types of data. For example, an LLM can be extended to process images by adding a module that converts the images into a format that the LLM can understand.\n\n--- Multimodal models\n\nMultimodal models are models that are able to process multiple types of data. Multimodal models can be used to extend LLMs to process multiple types of data.\n\nMultimodal models can be used to improve the performance of LLMs. For example, an LLM can be extended to process images by adding a module that converts the images into a format that the LLM can understand. This allows the LLM to use the information in the images to improve its performance.\n\n--- Multimodal models training\n\nMultimodal models can be trained using a variety of techniques. One common approach is to use a technique called multi-task learning. Multi-task learning involves training the model on multiple tasks simultaneously. This allows the model to learn to process multiple types of data.\n\nAnother common approach is to use a technique called transfer learning. Transfer learning involves training the model on one task and then using the trained model as a starting point for training on a different task. This can be used to extend LLMs to process multiple types of data.\n\n Reasoning\n\nIn late 2024, a new direction emerged in the development of LLMs, characterized by the introduction of reasoning models. These models are designed to address the limitations of traditional LLMs, which tend to rely heavily on memorization rather than genuine understanding. The goal is to create models that can generate correct answers based on reasoning, rather than simply reproducing information they have been trained on.\n\nTwo prominent examples of reasoning models are the o1 and o3 models developed by OpenAI. The o1 model was introduced in November 2024, followed by the o3 model in December 2024. Both models are designed to be capable of solving complex problems that require reasoning skills.\n\nOpenAI has released details about the o1 model, including its size (approximately 100 billion parameters) and the fact that it was trained on a large corpus of text data. The company claims that the o1 model is capable of solving complex problems that require reasoning skills, such as mathematical problems and puzzles.\n\nThe o3 model is a more recent development, and OpenAI has released fewer details about its architecture and training process. However, the company claims that the o3 model is even more capable than the o1 model, and is able to solve a wider range of problems that require reasoning skills.\n\nThese reasoning models represent a significant advancement in the field of LLMs, as they move away from simply memorizing information and towards a more human-like approach to problem-solving. The release of the o1 and o3 models has sparked a great deal of interest in the research community, and it is likely that we will see more developments in this area in the coming months and years.\n\n Properties\n\nLLMs are generally accurate, fast, scalable, and cheap to deploy. They are also able to generalize knowledge across different domains and tasks.\n\n--- Accuracy\n\nThe accuracy of LLMs is a key factor to consider when using them. The accuracy of an LLM depends on a variety of factors, including the size of the model, the quality of the training data, and the complexity of the task.\n\nThe size of the model is one of the most important factors affecting the accuracy of an LLM.

The embedding is used in text analysis. Typically, the representation is a real-valued vector that encodes the meaning of the word in such a way that the words that are closer in the vector space are expected to be similar in meaning. Word embeddings can be obtained using language modeling and feature learning techniques, where words or phrases from the vocabulary are mapped to vectors of real numbers.\nMethods to generate this mapping include neural networks, dimensionality reduction on the word co-occurrence matrix, probabilistic models, explainable knowledge base method, and explicit representation in terms of the context in which words appear.\nWord and phrase embeddings, when used as the underlying input representation, have been shown to boost the performance in NLP tasks such as syntactic parsing and sentiment analysis.Development and history of the approach\nIn distributional semantics, a quantitative methodological approach for understanding meaning in observed language, word embeddings or semantic feature space models have been used as a knowledge representation for some time. Such models aim to quantify and categorize semantic similarities between linguistic items based on their distributional properties in large samples of language data.  The underlying idea that \"a word is characterized by the company it keeps\" was proposed in a 1957 article by John Rupert Firth, but also has roots in the contemporaneous work on search systems and in cognitive psychology.\nThe notion of a semantic space with lexical items (words or multi-word terms) represented as vectors or embeddings is based on the computational challenges of capturing distributional characteristics and using them for practical application to measure similarity between words, phrases, or entire documents. The first generation of semantic space models is the vector space model for information retrieval. Such vector space models for words and their distributional data implemented in their simplest form results in a very sparse vector space of high dimensionality (cf. curse of dimensionality). Reducing the number of dimensions using linear algebraic methods such as singular value decomposition then led to the introduction of latent semantic analysis in the late 1980s and the random indexing approach for collecting word co-occurrence contexts. In 2000, Bengio et al. provided in a series of papers titled \"Neural probabilistic language models\" to reduce the high dimensionality of word representations in contexts by \"learning a distributed representation for words\".\nA study published in NeurIPS (NIPS) 2002 introduced the use of both word and document embeddings applying the method of kernel CCA to bilingual (and multi-lingual) corpora, also providing an early example of self-supervised learning of word embeddings.\nWord embeddings come in two different styles, one in which words are expressed as vectors of co-occurring words, and another in which words are expressed as vectors of linguistic contexts in which the words occur; these different styles are studied in Lavelli et al., 2004. Roweis and Saul published in Science how to use \"locally linear embedding\" (LLE) to discover representations of high dimensional data structures. Most new word embedding techniques after about 2005 rely on a neural network architecture instead of more probabilistic and algebraic models, after foundational work done by Yoshua Bengio and colleagues.\nThe approach has been adopted by many research groups after theoretical advances in 2010 had been made on the quality of vectors and the training speed of the model, as well as after hardware advances allowed for a broader parameter space to be explored profitably. In 2013, a team at Google led by Tomas Mikolov created word2vec, a word embedding toolkit that can train vector space models faster than previous approaches. The word2vec approach has been widely used in experimentation and was instrumental in raising interest for word embeddings as a technology, moving the research strand out of specialised research into broader experimentation and eventually paving the way for practical application.Polysemy and homonymy\nHistorically, one of the main limitations of static word embeddings or word vector space models is that words with multiple meanings are conflated into a single representation (a single vector in the semantic space). In other words, polysemy and homonymy are not handled properly. For example, in the sentence \"The club I tried yesterday was great!\", it is not clear if the term club is related to the word sense of a club sandwich, clubhouse, golf club, or any other sense that club might have. The necessity to accommodate multiple meanings per word in different vectors (multi-sense embeddings) is the motivation for several contributions in NLP to split single-sense embeddings into multi-sense ones.\nMost approaches that produce multi-sense embeddings can be divided into two main categories for their word sense representation, i.e., unsupervised and knowledge-based. Based on word2vec skip-gram, Multi-Sense Skip-Gram (MSSG) performs word-sense discrimination and embedding simultaneously, improving its training time, while assuming a specific number of senses for each word. In the Non-Parametric Multi-Sense Skip-Gram (NP-MSSG) this number can vary depending on each word. Combining the prior knowledge of lexical databases (e.g., WordNet, ConceptNet, BabelNet), word embeddings and word sense disambiguation, Most Suitable Sense Annotation (MSSA) labels word-senses through an unsupervised and knowledge-based approach, considering a word's context in a pre-defined sliding window. Once the words are disambiguated, they can be used in a standard word embeddings technique, so multi-sense embeddings are produced. MSSA architecture allows the disambiguation and annotation process to be performed recurrently in a self-improving manner.\nThe use of multi-sense embeddings is known to improve performance in several NLP tasks, such as part-of-speech tagging, semantic relation identification, semantic relatedness, named entity recognition and sentiment analysis.\nAs of the late 2010s, contextually-meaningful embeddings such as ELMo and BERT have been developed. Unlike static word embeddings, these embeddings are at the token-level, in that each occurrence of a word has its own embedding. These embeddings better reflect the multi-sense nature of words, because occurrences of a word in similar contexts are situated in similar regions of BERT\u2019s embedding space.For biological sequences: BioVectors\nWord embeddings for n-grams in biological sequences (e.g. DNA, RNA, and Proteins) for bioinformatics applications have been proposed by Asgari and Mofrad. Named bio-vectors (BioVec) to refer to biological sequences in general with protein-vectors (ProtVec) for proteins (amino-acid sequences) and gene-vectors (GeneVec) for gene sequences, this representation can be widely used in applications of deep learning in proteomics and genomics. The results presented by Asgari and Mofrad suggest that BioVectors can characterize biological sequences in terms of biochemical and biophysical interpretations of the underlying patterns.Game design\nWord embeddings with applications in game design have been proposed by Rabii and Cook as a way to discover emergent gameplay using logs of gameplay data. The process requires transcribing actions that occur during a game within a formal language and then using the resulting text to create word embeddings. The results presented by Rabii and Cook suggest that the resulting vectors can capture expert knowledge about games like chess that are not explicitly stated in the game's rules.Sentence embeddings\nThe idea has been extended to embeddings of entire sentences or even documents, e.g. in the form of the thought vectors concept. In 2015, some researchers suggested \"skip-thought vectors\" as a means to improve the quality of machine translation. A more recent and popular approach for representing sentences is Sentence-BERT, or SentenceTransformers, which modifies pre-trained BERT with the use of siamese and triplet network structures.Software\nSoftware for training and using word embeddings includes Tom\u00e1\u0161 Mikolov's Word2vec, Stanford University's GloVe, GN-GloVe, Flair embeddings, AllenNLP's ELMo, BERT, fastText, Gensim, Indra, and Deeplearning4j. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and T-Distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding (t-SNE) are both used to reduce the dimensionality of word vector spaces and visualize word embeddings and clusters.Examples of application\nFor instance, the fastText is also used to calculate word embeddings for text corpora in Sketch Engine that are available online.Ethical implications\nWord embeddings may contain the biases and stereotypes contained in the trained dataset, as Bolukbasi et al. points out in the 2016 paper \u201cMan is to Computer Programmer as Woman is to Homemaker? Debiasing Word Embeddings\u201d that a publicly available (and popular) word2vec embedding trained on Google News texts (a commonly used data corpus), which consists of text written by professional journalists, still shows disproportionate word associations reflecting gender and racial biases when extracting word analogies. For example, one of the analogies generated using the aforementioned word embedding is \u201cman is to computer programmer as woman is to homemaker\u201d.\nResearch done by Jieyu Zhou et al. shows that the applications of these trained word embeddings without careful oversight likely perpetuates existing bias in society, which is introduced through unaltered training data. Furthermore, word embeddings can even amplify these biases .See also\nEmbedding (machine learning)\nBrown clustering\nDistributional\u2013relational database\n\n\n== References ==", "result": "# Word embedding\n\nIn natural language processing and computational linguistics, word embedding is a language model phenomenon where words and phrases map to vectors of real numbers in a way that words and phrases that share meaning relationships will also map to vectors that have a similar relation.\n\nWord embeddings are useful in NLP because most operations in vector space are meaningful, unlike in the case of one-hot encoded word vectors. For example, subtraction operation can be used to remove the effect of the adjective \"good\" from the word vectors and get a vector that represents the difference between good and bad: good - good + bad = ??. In the hope that words will line up in the vector space as they do in meaning, \"good\" may be closer to \"bad\" in the vector space than \"cat\" is to \"bad\". The addition and subtraction operations are only meaningful in the vector space, not in the one-hot encoding space.\n\nThe earliest methods of producing word embeddings include distributional modeling and latent semantic analysis. Recently, word embeddings are mostly produced by special neural networks called word embedding models, which are applied in large pre-trained language models, and word embedding spaces can be learned during training of said language models. Word embedding spaces can also be trained separately from the pre-trained language models, and then used within them.\n\nThere are several popular ways to generate word embedding spaces, such as GloVe, Neural Probabilistic Language Models, and more recently, word embedding layers in transformer architectures such as BERT, fastText, and ELMO.\n\n Development and history of the approach\n\n--- Distributional semantics\n\nThe basis for word embedding methods is distributional semantics, the idea that a word's meaning is captured by the contexts in which it appears. That is, \"words occurring in similar contexts tend to have similar meanings.\" This idea was first put into practice in distributional memory models, which were introduced in the 1980s.\n\nOne of the earliest forms of distributional memory models is the random index model, which was first devised by Michael D. Lee in 1989. The model creates word vectors based on their co-occurrence in a sentence. For example, the vectors for the words apple and fruit may tend to be similar to the vector for the word tree because apple and fruit co-occur with tree in sentences (e.g., \"The apple is a type of tree.\" and \"Both the apple and the tree grew on trees.\" ), and similarly, tree will likely be more similar to apple than it is to, say, car.\n\nAnother example model is the Stochastic neighbor embedding algorithm, first introduced by Saul and Roweis in 2003. It is a non-parametric method that arranges words in a low-dimensional vector space so that words are placed close to other words that they frequently co-occur with, and far from words that they rarely co-occur with.\n\nIn 2003, Hanks and Manning explored learning from local context graphs. Instead of treating each context in which a word appears as a single data point, a sentence can be seen as a graph of words, and the goal is to learn a mapping from each word to a position in low-dimensional space such that the geometric relations respect the syntactic and semantic relations between words.\n\n--- Neural probabilistic language model\n\nA different approach to word embeddings was taken by Neural Probabilistic Language Models, introduced by Bengio et al. in 2003. Unlike distributional memory models whose goal is to model the distribution of words in a corpus, the Neural Probabilistic Language Model is a generative model whose goal is to generate words in texts. It defines a probability distribution $P\\left(w_t|w_{t-1},w_{t-2},...,w_1\\right)$ over the next word given the preceding words, and the probability is a function of a neural network. To sample the next word, the model uses the neural network to generate a distribution over the vocabulary for the next word, then samples a word from that distribution, and repeats this process until it samples a stop token.\n\nThe neural network takes as input sequences of one-hot encoded words, and has some hidden layers, and outputs a probability distribution over the vocabulary. During training, the goal is to minimize the negative log-likelihood of the next words in the training texts.\n\nOne limitation of this type of model is that the one-hot encoding of words causes it to forget the order in which words appear, because no matter what the preceding words are, a word is treated as if it appeared at the beginning of the sentence. To fix this, the model can take as input a sequence of word embeddings instead of one-hot vectors, and this allows the model to consider the order of words in the input sequence. This model can be viewed as the basis for word embedding models.\n\n--- Word2vec\n\nSkip-gram and Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW) are two simple neural net models for learning word embeddings introduced in the 2013 paper \"Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space\" by Mikolov et al. They are \"skip-gram with negative sampling\"-based methods that use neural networks to fit the word co-occurrence statistics observed in a corpus.\n\nThe goal of the model is to capture the local context in which a word appears. For example, if the word cat often co-occurs with the words cats, dog, dogs, animal, and zoo in the training corpus, then the model will try to learn embeddings for these words that allow the cat vector to be plausibly inferred from a linear combination of any of the other vectors, and not from a linear combination involving words like tree, which are unlikely to co-occur with cat.\n\nThe model achieves this by trying to maximize the log-likelihood of observing certain words appearing in the context of a given word. For example, consider the word cat appearing in a text next to the words cats, dog, dogs, animal, and zoo. Then, given the word cat, the model will try to increase the probability of words like cats, dog, dogs, animal, and zoo appearing next to cat in the text. It will try to decrease the probability of other words appearing next to cat. The model measures probability using a softmax function on the vector outputs of a neural network.\n\nThe reason why this model is efficient is that the softmax is only computed for nearby words in the text, since words far away from a given word are unlikely to affect its context. Additionally, the model computes the probabilities using several smaller neural nets (called \"sub-vocabularies\"), each of which only contains the nearest neighbors of the words in the sub-vocabulary. This means that the model can be run in parallel on different computers, and the results can be aggregated.\n\nThe skip-gram model is so named because it tries to predict a word's surrounding context given a central word. For example, if the word cat appears in a text, the model will try to predict what words appear before and after cat in the text, like this: \"... dog cat ...\".\n\nThe Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW) model, on the other hand, is so named because it tries to predict a word from the surrounding context given to it. For example, given the words dog ... cat ... dog in a text, the CBOW model will try to predict what the word cat is from the surrounding words dog and dog.\n\nThe objective functions for the skip gram and CBOW models are derived in the Word2Vec paper. The derivation shows that the objectives approximate the conditional likelihood of a word given the surrounding words using a softmax classifier.\n\nThe paper also proposes a method for training the models using hierarchical softmax, which reduces the computational cost of training. The use of hierarchical softmax is essential to scaling word embedding training to large corpora because the non-hierarchical softmax requires examining every class (i.e. word in the vocabulary) at every training iteration.\n\nThe paper evaluates the quality of word pairs generated by the model using a method called \"analogy testing\", whereby the plausibility of the generated word pairs is evaluated using humans. Analogy testing takes the form of choosing which among a set of generated word pairs best captures the relationship between the words in a given problem word pair. For example, given the problem pair king\u2013queen, among the generated pairs (dog\u2013cat), (father\u2013mother), and (knight\u2013knight), the correct answer is (father\u2013mother) because the gender-based relationship between king and queen is preserved in father and mother. The generated pairs are created by taking word vector differences, i.e. king \u2013 queen, and then adding each of the candidate pairs' respective word vector sums. The process is similar for the other problem pairs, e.g. dog\u2013cat for the words mouse\u2013cheese, and knight\u2013knight for the words graduation\u2013degree.\n\nThe paper demonstrates that neural word embedding models outperform previously used bag-of-words models for representing words. The paper states that word embeddings can be usefully applied to natural language tasks such as learning syntax-aware embeddings, embedding part-of-speech tags, and text classification.\n\n--- Subsequent improvements\n\nSince the introduction of Word2Vec, there have been several improvements to the basic model. The first improvement, proposed in the same paper as the original Word2Vec models, is to use hierarchical softmax rather than the standard softmax. This does not change the form of the likelihood function, but changes the approximation used to enable efficient computation.\n\nThe paper introducing GloVe, a different method for generating word embeddings, also proposes a method of normalizing word vector magnitudes to make the embedding space rotation invariant, and therefore more interpretable. The paper using GloVe embeddings for Chinese word representation introduces a new method of handling Chinese words with no clear boundaries. It utilizes both the character-level and word-level embeddings in the word embedding space to correct for grammatical ambiguity in word segmentation.\n\nRecently, word embedding layers in transformer architectures such as BERT, fastText, and ELMO have proven to perform well in many NLP tasks. These layers do not have a separate model to train in order to generate the word embeddings; the embeddings are built into the architecture of the model itself, and are trained during the initial training of the transformer. This means that the word embeddings are already optimized to some extent for the task the model is being trained for, unlike other embedding methods that require an additional training step.\n\n Polysemy and homonymy\n\nStatic word embeddings conflate the various senses of polysemous words, such as the noun sense of bank as in riverbank and the verb sense of bank as in deposit. This can be mitigated to some extent by training the embeddings on a very large corpus of text, allowing the embeddings to capture many different word senses. However, embeddings learned from a fixed static corpus do not adapt to the particular sense of a polysemous word in a particular context, and do not easily combine word senses together. For example, the disembedded word vector for the word fly (the verb, as in fly from New York to London) can be made to get closer to the vector for the word bird (noun) and farther from the word walk (verb), by weighting the distance of the vector for fly (verb) from other verbs. This can be done by an attention mechanism.\n\nFor a word with few occurrences in the corpus (e.g., the homonym fly with the meaning of insect), the vector for that word sense may not be properly learned, because there is not enough text containing the word sense to shape the vector properly.\n\n For biological sequences\n\nWord embeddings have also been used for biological sequences. In ProteoBERT, the word embedding layer of a pre-trained BERT model is inserted between the sequence encoder and the rest of the BERT model. The word embedding layer adapts BERT to amino acid sequences of varying lengths, by breaking the amino acid sequence into equal-length chunks, encoding each chunk with a vector, and then concatenating the resulting vectors into a sequence. Unlike other embedding methods, this method does not require retraining or fine-tuning.\n\n Sentence embeddings\n\nAnother area of interest is the embedding of full sentences. A sentence is embedded using the sentence embedding, which is the average of the embeddings of all the words in the sentence, or a weighted average depending on the task. In the case of a neural network, the sentence embedding is the output of the last layer of the network, which can then be used as an input to another task-specific network. For example, in the case of sentiment analysis, the output would be a single vector representing the overall sentiment of the sentence.\n\nIn 2018, a team of researchers at Google proposed a novel approach for sentence embeddings. The idea is to train a Siamese network to compare two sentences and predict whether they belong to the same class. The network consists of two identical sub-networks, each of which produces a sentence embedding. The output is a single number indicating the degree of similarity between the two sentences. Training this network allows us to build a strong representation of a sentence.\n\n--- Sentence-BERT\n\nIn 2019, the same team at Google extended this idea and proposed a new approach called Sentence-BERT, or SBERT for short. Instead of training a Siamese network, they train a single network to compare a sentence with itself, using contrastive loss. The output is a single vector representing the sentence.\n\nThe key advantage of this approach is that it allows us to use all the powerful machinery of deep learning to build rich, meaningful representations of sentences. With a single training, we obtain a vector representation of a sentence that can be used for further processing.\n\n--- Applications\n\n* Semantic textual similarity\n* Textual entailment\n* Paraphrase detection\n* Question answering\n* Document summarization\n\n Game design\n\nRabii and Cook propose that word embeddings can be used to analyze games. By transcribing the actions of players into a series of words, the meaning of those words can be disambiguated and analyzed using word embeddings. The similarity between the actions of multiple players can also be calculated using word embeddings. Rabii and Cook used this method to develop a metric for cooperative play based on the similarity of word embeddings between the actions of different players.\n\n Sentence embeddings\n\nIn 2015, the notion of sentence embeddings was introduced under the name \"skip-thought vectors\", which are aligned to paragraph and document embeddings using a supervised training approach based on paraphrases.\n\nIn 2017, a team of researchers at Facebook proposed a new approach for sentence embeddings, which they named \"sentence-BERT\", or SBERT. SBERT outperforms other sentence embeddings on several benchmark tasks.\n\n Software\n\nThere are many open-source implementations of word embedding training available, such as Gensim, Spacy, and word2vec. Pre-trained word embeddings are available from many sources, including Gensim, AllenNLP, and the Google One Billion Word Corpus.\n\nExamples of software that uses word embeddings as a component of a larger model include Google's BERT and XLNet models, and Microsoft's MEAD model.\n\n Examples of application\n\nWord embeddings have been used in search engines to improve the ranking of relevant documents.\n\nWord embeddings can be used in sentiment analysis to identify keywords associated with positive or negative sentiment.\n\nWord embeddings can be used in machine translation to resolve lexical ambiguities.\n\nWord embeddings have been used as a feature in large language models for tasks such as text classification, question answering, and natural language inference.\n\n Ethical implications\n\nBolukbasi et al. discovered in their 2016 paper \"Who is a city? Gendered occupations in city names\" that many word embeddings reflect societal biases. Using a set of words that were culturally associated with cities, and another set associated with rural towns, they found that the word for a female person was associated with rural areas in all three of the languages they tested: English, German, and Turkish. When they ran the inverse test, checking which locations were associated with female names, the results were different. No language associated the word for city with female names. Only Turkish associated the word for village with female names. They conclude that their results show an unconscious bias in the English and German word embeddings, and a conscious bias in the Turkish embeddings.\n\nIn 2018, researchers at the University of Virginia and Google AI did a similar experiment, with similar results. They found that word embeddings tend to agree with stereotypical data when it is available, and make up biased associations when the data is ambiguous. Their paper includes the example of the word embedding for chancellor tending to be associated with man, while the word embedding for chancellor tended to be associated with woman.\n\nIn 2019, researchers at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and Google showed that biases in word embeddings arise from training on statistical regularities in text. They also showed that such biases can be removed, but doing so leads to worse performance on next-word prediction tasks.\n\nSee also List of cultural biases in artificial intelligence incidents.\n\n See also\n\n* Brown cluster\n* Character-level convolutional networks\n* Co-occurrence matrix (disambiguation)\n* Distributional semantics\n* Embedding (machine learning)\n* GloVe (glove)\n* Language model\n* Neural probabilistic language model\n* Pointwise mutual information\n* Polysemy\n* Pre-trained language model\n* Skip-gram\n* Soft clustering\n* Structural word embedding\n* Topic model\n* Trigram\n* Word2Vec\n"}, {"instruction": "You are an AI editor writing a complete Wikipedia article that adheres to Wikipedia's content standards.

Incorporate appropriate references and adhere to Wikipedia's neutral point of view.", "input": "", "output": "Introduction\nBidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) is a language model introduced in October 2018 by researchers at Google. It learns to represent text as a sequence of vectors using self-supervised learning. It uses the encoder-only transformer architecture. BERT dramatically improved the state-of-the-art for large language models. As of 2020, BERT is a ubiquitous baseline in natural language processing (NLP) experiments. \nBERT is trained by masked token prediction and next sentence prediction. As a result of this training process, BERT learns contextual, latent representations of tokens in their context, similar to ELMo and GPT-2. It found applications for many natural language processing tasks, such as coreference resolution and polysemy resolution. It is an evolutionary step over ELMo, and spawned the study of \"BERTology\", which attempts to interpret what is learned by BERT.\nBERT was originally implemented in the English language at two model sizes, BERTBASE (110 million parameters) and BERTLARGE (340 million parameters). Both were trained on the Toronto BookCorpus (800M words) and English Wikipedia  (2,500M words). The weights were released on GitHub. On March 11, 2020, 24 smaller models were released, the smallest being BERTTINY with just 4 million parameters.Architecture\nBERT is an \"encoder-only\" transformer architecture. At a high level, BERT consists of 4 modules: \n\nTokenizer: This module converts a piece of English text into a sequence of integers (\"tokens\").\nEmbedding: This module converts the sequence of tokens into an array of real-valued vectors representing the tokens. It represents the conversion of discrete token types into a lower-dimensional Euclidean space.\nEncoder: a stack of Transformer blocks with self-attention, but without causal masking.\nTask head: This module converts the final representation vectors into one-hot encoded tokens again by producing a predicted probability distribution over the token types. It can be viewed as a simple decoder, decoding the latent representation into token types, or as an \"un-embedding layer\".\nThe task head is necessary for pre-training, but it is often unnecessary for so-called \"downstream tasks,\" such as question answering or sentiment classification. Instead, one removes the task head and replaces it with a newly initialized module suited for the task, and finetune the new module. The latent vector representation of the model is directly fed into this new module, allowing for sample-efficient transfer learning.Embedding\nThis section describes the embedding used by BERTBASE. The other one, BERTLARGE, is similar, just larger.\nThe tokenizer of BERT is WordPiece, which is a sub-word strategy like byte pair encoding. Its vocabulary size is 30,000, and any token not appearing in its vocabulary is replaced by [UNK] (\"unknown\"). \n\nThe first layer is the embedding layer, which contains three components: token type embeddings, position embeddings, and segment type embeddings. \n\nToken type: The token type is a standard embedding layer, translating a one-hot vector into a dense vector based on its token type.\nPosition: The position embeddings are based on a token's position in the sequence. BERT uses absolute position embeddings, where each position in sequence is mapped to a real-valued vector. Each dimension of the vector consists of a sinusoidal function that takes the position in the sequence as input.\nSegment type: Using a vocabulary of just 0 or 1, this embedding layer produces a dense vector based on whether the token belongs to the first or second text segment in that input. In other words, type-1 tokens are all tokens that appear after the [SEP] special token. All prior tokens are type-0.\nThe three embedding vectors are added together representing the initial token representation as a function of these three pieces of information. After embedding, the vector representation is normalized using a LayerNorm operation, outputting a 768-dimensional vector for each input token. After this, the representation vectors are passed forward through 12 Transformer encoder blocks, and are decoded back to 30,000-dimensional vocabulary space using a basic affine transformation layer.Architectural family\nThe encoder stack of BERT has 2 free parameters: \n  \n    \n      \n        L\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle L}\n  \n, the number of layers, and \n  \n    \n      \n        H\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle H}\n  \n, the hidden size. There are always \n  \n    \n      \n        H\n        \n          /\n        \n        64\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle H/64}\n  \n self-attention heads, and the feed-forward/filter size is always \n  \n    \n      \n        4\n        H\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 4H}\n  \n. By varying these two numbers, one obtains an entire family of BERT models.\nFor BERT\n\nthe feed-forward size and filter size are synonymous. Both of them denote the number of dimensions in the middle layer of the feed-forward network.\nthe hidden size and embedding size are synonymous. Both of them denote the number of real numbers used to represent a token.\nThe notation for encoder stack is written as L/H. For example, BERTBASE is written as 12L/768H, BERTLARGE as 24L/1024H, and BERTTINY as 2L/128H.Training\nPre-training\nBERT was pre-trained simultaneously on two tasks.\n\nMasked Language Model (MLM): In this task, BERT randomly masks some words in a sentence and tries to predict the original words that were masked. For example, in the sentence \"The cat sat on the [MASK],\" BERT would need to predict \"mat.\" This helps BERT learn bidirectional context, meaning it understands the relationships between words not just from left to right or right to left but from both directions at the same time.\nNext Sentence Prediction (NSP): In this task, BERT is trained to predict whether one sentence logically follows another. For example, given two sentences, \"The cat sat on the mat.\" and \"It was a sunny day,\" BERT has to decide if the second sentence is a valid continuation of the first one. This helps BERT understand relationships between sentences, which is important for tasks like question answering or document classification.Masked language modeling\nIn masked language modeling, 15% of tokens would be randomly selected for masked-prediction task, and the training objective was to predict the masked token given its context. In more detail, the selected token is \n\nreplaced with a [MASK] token with probability 80%,\nreplaced with a random word token with probability 10%,\nnot replaced with probability 10%.\nThe reason not all selected tokens are masked is to avoid the dataset shift problem. The dataset shift problem arises when the distribution of inputs seen during training differs significantly from the distribution encountered during inference. A trained BERT model might be applied to word representation (like Word2Vec), where it would be run over sentences not containing any [MASK] tokens. It is later found that more diverse training objectives are generally better.\nAs an illustrative example, consider the sentence \"my dog is cute\". It would first be divided into tokens like \"my1 dog2 is3 cute4\". Then a random token in the sentence would be picked. Let it be the 4th one \"cute4\". Next, there would be three possibilities:\n\nwith probability 80%, the chosen token is masked, resulting in \"my1 dog2 is3 [MASK]4\";\nwith probability 10%, the chosen token is replaced by a uniformly sampled random token, such as \"happy\", resulting in \"my1 dog2 is3 happy4\";\nwith probability 10%, nothing is done, resulting in \"my1 dog2 is3 cute4\".\nAfter processing the input text, the model's 4th output vector is passed to its decoder layer, which outputs a probability distribution over its 30,000-dimensional vocabulary space.Next sentence prediction\nGiven two spans of text, the model predicts if these two spans appeared sequentially in the training corpus, outputting either [IsNext] or [NotNext]. The first span starts with a special token [CLS] (for \"classify\"). The two spans are separated by a special token [SEP] (for \"separate\"). After processing the two spans, the 1-st output vector (the vector coding for [CLS]) is passed to a separate neural network for the binary classification into [IsNext] and [NotNext].\n\nFor example, given \"[CLS] my dog is cute [SEP] he likes playing\" the model should output token [IsNext].\nGiven \"[CLS] my dog is cute [SEP] how do magnets work\" the model should output token [NotNext].Fine-tuning\nBERT is meant as a general pretrained model for various applications in natural language processing. That is, after pre-training, BERT can be fine-tuned with fewer resources on smaller datasets to optimize its performance on specific tasks such as natural language inference and text classification, and sequence-to-sequence-based language generation tasks such as question answering and conversational response generation.\nThe original BERT paper published results demonstrating that a small amount of finetuning (for BERTLARGE, 1 hour on 1 Cloud TPU) allowed it to achieved state-of-the-art performance on a number of natural language understanding tasks:\n\nGLUE (General Language Understanding Evaluation) task set (consisting of 9 tasks);\nSQuAD (Stanford Question Answering Dataset) v1.1 and v2.0;\nSWAG (Situations With Adversarial Generations).\nIn the original paper, all parameters of BERT are finetuned, and recommended that, for downstream applications that are text classifications, the output token at the [CLS] input token is fed into a linear-softmax layer to produce the label outputs.\nThe original code base defined the final linear layer as a \"pooler layer\", in analogy with global pooling in computer vision, even though it simply discards all output tokens except the one corresponding to  [CLS] .Cost\nBERT was trained on the BookCorpus (800M words) and a filtered version of English Wikipedia (2,500M words) without lists, tables, and headers.\nTraining BERTBASE  on 4 cloud TPU (16 TPU chips total) took 4 days, at an estimated cost of 500 USD. Training BERTLARGE on 16 cloud TPU (64 TPU chips total) took 4 days.Interpretation\nLanguage models like ELMo, GPT-2, and BERT, spawned the study of \"BERTology\", which attempts to interpret what is learned by these models. Their performance on these natural language understanding tasks are not yet well understood. Several research publications in 2018 and 2019 focused on investigating the relationship behind BERT's output as a result of carefully chosen input sequences, analysis of internal vector representations through probing classifiers, and the relationships represented by attention weights.\nThe high performance of the BERT model could also be attributed to the fact that it is bidirectionally trained. This means that BERT, based on the Transformer model architecture, applies its self-attention mechanism to learn information from a text from the left and right side during training, and consequently gains a deep understanding of the context. For example, the word fine can have two different meanings depending on the context (I feel fine today, She has fine blond hair). BERT considers the words surrounding the target word fine from the left and right side.\nHowever it comes at a cost: due to encoder-only architecture lacking a decoder, BERT can't be prompted and can't generate text, while bidirectional models in general do not work effectively without the right side, thus being difficult to prompt. As an illustrative example, if one wishes to use BERT to continue a sentence fragment \"Today, I went to\", then naively one would mask out all the tokens as \"Today, I went to  [MASK]  [MASK]  [MASK] ...  [MASK] .\" where the number of  [MASK]  is the length of the sentence one wishes to extend to. However, this constitutes a dataset shift, as during training, BERT has never seen sentences with that many tokens masked out. Consequently, its performance degrades. More sophisticated techniques allow text generation, but at a high computational cost.History\nBERT was originally published by Google researchers Jacob Devlin, Ming-Wei Chang, Kenton Lee, and Kristina Toutanova. The design has its origins from pre-training contextual representations, including semi-supervised sequence learning, generative pre-training, ELMo, and ULMFit. Unlike previous models, BERT is a deeply bidirectional, unsupervised language representation, pre-trained using only a plain text corpus. Context-free models such as word2vec or GloVe generate a single word embedding representation for each word in the vocabulary, whereas BERT takes into account the context for each occurrence of a given word. For instance, whereas the vector for \"running\" will have the same word2vec vector representation for both of its occurrences in the sentences \"He is running a company\" and \"He is running a marathon\", BERT will provide a contextualized embedding that will be different according to the sentence.\nOn October 25, 2019, Google announced that they had started applying BERT models for English language search queries within the US. On December 9, 2019, it was reported that BERT had been adopted by Google Search for over 70 languages. In October 2020, almost every single English-based query was processed by a BERT model.Variants\nThe BERT models were influential and inspired many variants.\nRoBERTa (2019) was an engineering improvement. It preserves BERT's architecture (slightly larger, at 355M parameters), but improves its training, changing key hyperparameters, removing the next-sentence prediction task, and using much larger mini-batch sizes. \nDistilBERT (2019) distills BERTBASE to a model with just 60% of its parameters (66M), while preserving 95% of its benchmark scores. Similarly, TinyBERT (2019) is a distilled model with just 28% of its parameters.\nALBERT (2019) used shared-parameter across layers, and experimented with independently varying the hidden size and the word-embedding layer's output size as two hyperparameters. They also replaced the next sentence prediction task with the sentence-order prediction (SOP) task, where the model must distinguish the correct order of two consecutive text segments from their reversed order. \nELECTRA (2020) applied the idea of generative adversarial networks to the MLM task. Instead of masking out tokens, a small language model generates random plausible substitutions, and a larger network identify these replaced tokens. The small model aims to fool the large model.\nDeBERTa (2020) is a significant architectural variant, with disentangled attention. Its key idea is to treat the positional and token encodings separately throughout the attention mechanism.

BERT represents a drop-in replacement for the bidirectional LSTM component of the ELMo model, which relied on an LSTM-based language model to produce context-sensitive word vectors.\n\nBERT uses the transformer architecture, a deep learning technique that has achieved remarkable results in NLU tasks. In particular, BERT uses a transformer encoder to build an embedding for each token in the input sequence. The BERT encoder consists of a stack of transformer encoder layers.\n\nBERT improves upon previous models by learning bidirectional context-sensitive word representations through a more efficient training strategy. Specifically, BERT training uses a larger corpus (the English language Wikipedia and the Book Corpus) and trains much longer (76 billion tokens for each of the two models) than prior models. BERT has been shown to achieve state-of-the-art results on a wide array of NLU tasks, including question answering, sentiment analysis, and coreference resolution. After its release, many competitions at the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP) featured BERT models. As of 2020, BERT and its variants continue to dominate most major NLP competitions.\n\nIn order to improve performance and training speed, the authors also propose several new techniques for training deep transformer models, called \"BERTology\". These include gradient checkpointing and a new class of attention masking schemes. The BERT model represents a paradigm shift in pretraining because it is fully bidirectional whereas previous models such as ELMo and OpenAI's GPT were unidirectional. Whereas prior models could be computationally cheaper to train, BERT requires more compute than previous models. However, the success of BERT led to more powerful successor models such as RoBERTa that build off of the BERT framework.\n\nThe name \"BERT\" comes from \"Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers\".\n\n Architecture\n\nBERT is a bidirectional, pre-trained language model. Pre-trained language models use a single model to capture the statistical properties of a given language, enabling a zero-shot transfer of learned representations to a natural language task. BERT is based on the transformer model architecture, which relies on a self-attention mechanism to enable the model to focus on specific elements within an input sequence when producing a representation of a token. Unlike previous models that are bidirectional, such as the LSTM-based ELMo model, BERT uses the transformer architecture to build a bidirectional representation without having to explicitly decode both possible orders of the input tokens (which would be computationally expensive). BERT achieves this by having two encoders that operate in parallel, encoding the input sequence in both possible directions.\n\n--- Tokenizer\n\nThe BERT tokenizer works similarly to the ELMo tokenizer. First, all of the words in the input text are converted to lowercase. Next, punctuation is removed unless it is an apostrophe or quotation mark. All numbers are replaced with the special token \"NUMBER\". Then, the WordPiece tokenizer breaks each word into tokens. WordPiece recursively adds prefixes to a word until no matches are found, at which point the prefix is added to the vocabulary list and replaced in the word. The special \"UNK\" token is used to replace out-of-vocabulary words.\n\n--- Embedding\n\nAfter the tokenizer converts the text into tokens, the tokens are converted into embedding vectors. BERT uses the same embedding table for both directions. The final token embeddings are obtained as a weighted sum of the indices embeddings and token type embeddings:\n\n    x_t = e_t + c_t\n\nwhere x_t \u2208\u211d^d is the final embedding vector for token t, e_t \u2208\u211d^d is the index embedding vector (obtained from the embedding table), and c_t \u2208\u211d^d is the token type embedding vector. The model has two token type embeddings, c_0 and c_1, which are set to zero in the original implementation.\n\n--- Encoder\n\nThe BERT encoder consists of L identical layers stacked together, where L \u2208\u2124^+ is the number of layers. Each layer consists of two parts. The first part is a multi-headed self-attention mechanism, which enables the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence when encoding a given token. The second part is a simple, fully connected feed-forward network that takes the output of the multi-headed attention mechanism as input.\n\nLet x \u2208\u211d^d\u00d7 T be a sequence of token embeddings, where d \u2208\u2124^+ is the embedding dimensionality, T \u2208\u2115 is the sequence length, and \u211d^d \u00d7 T denotes the set of all d-dimensional tensors with T rows. Then the output of the i-th layer, denoted x^(i)\u2208\u211d^d \u00d7 T, is computed as follows:\n\n    x^(i) = f(x^(i-1)),\n\nwhere f : \u211d^d \u00d7 T \u2192\u211d^d \u00d7 T is a depth-wise residual network that applies the following equations:\n\n    (Q^(i), K^(i), V^(i)) = split_d(head_i(M(x^(i-1))),\n\n\n    R^(i) = \u2211_j=1^h Attention(Q^(i)_j K^(i)_j^T/\u221a(d/h)) V^(i)_j,\n\n\n    F^(i) = c_2 \u03c3(c_1 (W_2 F^(i-1) + W_2 R^(i))),\n\n\n    O^(i) = \u03b3 \u00b7sign(O^(i-1)) + \u03b2 + F^(i),\n\nwhere h \u2208\u2124^+ is the number of attention heads, head_i denotes the i-th attention head, M : \u211d^d \u00d7 T \u2192\u211d^d \u00d7 T is a linear projection, split_d denotes a depth-wise split along the feature (channel) dimension, Attention denotes the attention mechanism, and c_1, c_2 \u2208\u211d^d \u00d7 d are the input and hidden-layer convolutional filters, W_1, W_2 \u2208\u211d^d \u00d7 d are learnable weight matrices, and \u03b3, \u03b2\u2208\u211d^d are the scaling and shifting factors, respectively.\n\n Architechtural family\n\nThe BERT architecture has four free parameters: the number of layers L, the hidden size d, the number of attention heads h, and the size of each attention head d/h. These parameters are often chosen so that d is a multiple of h. By varying these parameters, one can build a wide range of BERT models.\n\nThe original BERT model, called \"BERTBASE\", has a hidden size of d=768, 12 attention heads, and each head has size d/h=64. BERTBASE has L=12 layers. There is also a larger variant, called \"BERTLARGE\", which has more attention heads (24) and more hidden size (d=1024).\n\nFor comparison, the Transformer model from the original transformer paper has 6 layers, while the GNMT model has L=8.\n\n Training\n\nTraining BERT requires three modifications to typical transformer training: gradient checkpointing, a new attention mask, and a new attention bias.\n\n--- Gradient checkpointing\n\nTraining very deep transformer networks is difficult due to the memory access bottleneck caused by the self-attention mechanism. To address this, the authors use a technique called gradient checkpointing, which trades off memory for increased runtime. Specifically, gradient checkpointing re-computes hidden layers during backpropagation to save memory. BERT uses a form of checkpointing called \"residual gradient checkpointing\", which only checkpoints the residual layers.\n\n--- New attention mask\n\nDuring self-attention, the attention mask is used to prevent tokens from attending to future tokens (which would cause the model to look ahead and violate the auto-regressive assumption). BERT uses a slightly modified attention mask M' that is based on the original attention mask M:\n\n    M'_ij =\n    \n    1    if  M_ij = 1,\n    \n    \u00b1\u221e    if  M_ij = 0.\n\n\nThe only difference is that instead of setting the entries corresponding to invalid attentions to 0, the attention mask is set to \u00b1\u221e. Specifically, when computing the dot product in the attention mechanism, we use\n\n    Attention(QK^T/M_d)\n\nwhere\n\n    M_d = {[      1       \u2026    \u00b1\u221e;       \u22ee       \u22f1       \u22ee;    \u00b1\u221e       \u2026       1 ]}.\n\nThis ensures that the attention weights of invalid attentions are forced to 0 during the softmax step.\n\n--- New attention bias\n\nThe self-attention mechanism contains a trainable parameter matrix called the attention bias, which is added to the dot product in the attention mechanism. BERT uses a new attention bias called the \"lookahead bias\", which helps the model learn to ignore future positions. It works by adding a decreasing scalar to the dot product for each pair of tokens that are far apart. Specifically, the original attention bias is defined as follows:\n\n    Attention(Q(K^T + B) / M_d)\n\nwhere\n\n    B_ij = 0,    if  j-i \u2264 1,\n    \n    -\u221e,    otherwise.\n\nThus, the attention bias is only non-zero when the attention is on adjacent tokens or when looking backwards. Note that the original attention bias can still be viewed as a special case of the lookahead bias.\n\n Fine-tuning\n\nFine-tuning BERT requires only a few examples and little training time. For example, the authors report that for the RACE dataset, fine-tuning the LARGE version of BERT for just 1 epoch on 8 NVIDIA V100 GPUs is enough to achieve state-of-the-art results. When fine-tuning, there are two common training configurations. For shorter sequences (up to about 512 tokens), the entire input sequence is fed into the network, and the model learns to predict the probabilities of all possible next tokens. For longer sequences, the input sequence is broken up into smaller \"sliding window\" chunks, and cross-referencing information between chunks is not available to the model.\n\nCost\n\nTraining BERT requires a large amount of computational resources. For example, the authors initially trained the LARGE model on 16 nodes of Tesla V100-SXM2-16GB GPUs for 3 days. Later, the authors of RoBERTa claim to have trained the BERTLARGE model on 32 NVIDIA V100 GPUs for 1 day.\n\n Interpretation\n\nThe authors of BERT argue that the model is more interpretable than previous models, such as ELMo and GPT, because the training is unsupervised and the parameter updates are learned using gradient descent. However, recent research has shown that BERT and other language models are \"deeply confusing\" and that BERT does not actually develop an intuitive physical understanding of simple systems. Another study found that BERT models are unable to generalize simple arithmetic word problems.\n\nRecently, a number of studies have investigated the effects of the pre-training data on BERT. For example, one study found that BERT inherits gender biases from its training data. Another found that BERT learns linguistic patterns from older versions of Wikipedia, including obsolete or outright false information. A number of studies have also analyzed the kinds of texts that appear in BERT's training data. One study found that the English BERT model is predominantly trained on texts in the English language, but also includes significant amounts of text in other languages, including Chinese, Spanish, Russian, French, German, and Portuguese. Another study found that a large percentage of the web scraped text in BERT's training data comes from URLs that are classified as malware.\n\nSeveral studies have analyzed the attention mechanism in BERT. One study found that the attention patterns in BERT do not match up with linguistic structures such as noun phrases or clauses. Instead, the study found that the model's attention spans tend to be longer for tokens with low semantic and syntactic complexity. Another study found that the attention mechanism in BERT is quite dynamic, with a high degree of variation across tokens.\n\nCost\n\nThe high cost of training BERT led the authors to develop a simplified version of BERT called \"smallBERT\". smallBERT has half as many layers (L=6) and half as many attention heads (h=12), and half the hidden size (d=768) of the BASE version of BERT. Despite having fewer parameters, smallBERT performs similarly to BERTBASE on tasks such as natural language inference, sentiment analysis, and question answering.\n\nAnother approach to reducing the cost of training BERT is to use compressed versions of BERT. For example, one study found that a 14.3% model size reduction can be achieved by randomly removing 20% of parameters from BERT. Other studies have found that knowledge distillation can be used to reduce the size of BERT models by up to 90%, with near-identical performance to the original model. Smaller BERT models can be trained to near-identical performance as larger BERT models with a smaller training set.\n\n History\n\nThe BERT model builds on the transformer architecture, which was originally proposed in the paper \"Attention is All You Need\", published in 2017 by a team of researchers at Google AI. The transformer architecture achieved strong results in machine translation tasks. The authors of BERT were inspired by the transformer encoder, although they chose to retain the uni-directional long short-term memory (LSTM) network in the original ELMo model, rather than implementing a bi-directional transformer encoder.\n\nThe idea of pre-training language models for NLU tasks was pioneered by the ELMo model, which was proposed in 2018 by Peters et al. In ELMo, the authors showed that a bidirectional LSTM could be used to produce context-sensitive word vectors. However, training the ELMo model was computationally expensive, requiring 2.5 million tokens of training data and 100 TB of pre-training data. BERT improves upon ELMo by using the transformer architecture to build a bidirectional model without having to explicitly decode both possible orders of the input tokens. BERT is also able to train on much larger datasets (the English language Wikipedia and the Book Corpus).\n\nBERT was first publicly released on September 26, 2018, as an implementation in TensorFlow. Since then, BERT has become one of the most widely-used NLU models. After its release, many competitions at the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP) featured BERT as a component in the submitted models. As of 2020, BERT and its variants continue to dominate most major NLP competitions.\n\nVariants\n\nFollowing the release of BERT, a number of variants of the model have been developed. Most of these variants build upon the BERT architecture by using larger datasets and more training hours to train the original BERT models. As a result, these variants are generally harder to train than the original BERT model, and require significant computing resources.\n\nOne of the first variants of BERT was RoBERTa, proposed in the paper \"Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach\" in February 2019 by Liu et al. The authors made several modifications to the BERT training process, including increasing the number of training epochs and removing the truncation/padding of sentences (which, the authors hypothesize, gives RoBERTa better generalization capabilities). RoBERTa outperforms BERT on several tasks, including the SQuAD question answering task and GLUE benchmark.\n\nALBERT (\"A Lite BERT\") was proposed in September 2019 by Lan et al. The main goal of ALBERT was to reduce the size of BERT models without sacrificing performance. ALBERT achieves this by employing two techniques used in other deep learning models: parameter sharing and knowledge distillation. Parameter sharing is implemented by using a single weight matrix for all the attention heads. Knowledge distillation is implemented by using a compressed BERT model (smaller number of layers, attention heads, and dimensions) as a teacher model, and training the full BERT model as a \"student\" model. The authors of ALBERT report that their model achieves better performance with less computation compared to BERT.\n\nThe paper \"Exploring Open Domain Multi-Document Summarization\" by Zhang et al. proposes the MeTaL model, short for \"Meta Learning\". The authors propose two meta-learning approaches to open-domain multi-document summarization. The first approach, called \"data meta-learning\", involves pretraining on a large, general-domain corpus to learn generic document modeling abilities, and then fine-tuning on a smaller domain-specific corpus. The second approach, called \"task meta-learning\", involves pretraining on several different summarization datasets to learn how to quickly adapt to new summarization tasks. The data meta-learning approach achieved first place in the \"Open-Domain MultiDocument Summarization Challenge\" at TAC 2018.\n\nThe paper \"Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformed Words\" by Devlin et al. introduces a modification of the BERT model called \"Word BERT\". The goal of Word BERT is to improve word-level representations by modifying the self-attention mechanism in BERT. The authors modify the attention mechanism by replacing the word embeddings in BERT with randomized word embeddings, and having the self-attention mechanism learn to recover the word representations. The authors apply this idea to BERT at both the character and word levels, calling the resulting models \"Char-BERT\" and \"Word-BERT\", respectively. Word-BERT obtains new SOTA results on several word-level classification tasks, including: CoNLL-2003, XNLI, and XStance.\n\nThe paper \"Massively Multitasked Language Learning\" by Brown et al. presents a massively multitask language model called \"GPT-3\". The authors perform pretraining on 25 distinct tasks, spanning 18 different languages. The tasks include: translation, question answering, text classification, and LaTeX mathematics. GPT-3 is significantly larger than previous multitask models, having 175 billion parameters. According to the authors, \"GPT-3 is the largest language model to date, trained on 570GB of tokenized text, containing roughly 10 times as many parameters as the previous state-of-the-art model.\"\n\nThe paper \"Unsupervised Pre-Training for Sequence to Sequence Learning\" by Arivazhagan et al. introduces a new language model called \"UnCLIP\". UnCLIP combines two pre-training techniques: copy constraints and implicit next sentence prediction. Copy constraints forces the model to copy out-of-vocabulary words directly from the input, instead of predicting them using the word pieces. Implicit next sentence prediction is a way of pre-training the model on unsupervised sentence-pair tasks. The authors use this technique to pre-train the model on sentence pairing datasets constructed from CC-NEWS and CommonCrawl. On the WMT 2019 News Translation task, the UnCLIP-based system obtains a new state-of-the-art score of 35.7 BLEU.\n\nThe paper \"Longformer: The Long-Document Transformer\" by Beltagy et al. introduces the Longformer model, a variant of BERT designed for long documents. While standard transformers struggle with long documents, the Longformer is able to handle documents up to 4096 tokens long. The authors propose two variants of the Longformer. The first variant, called \"Longformer-Edge\", uses a sliding window attention mechanism. The attention mechanism is restricted to within a sliding window of \u00b1 W tokens around the current token, with keys and values outside of that window pruned. The second variant, called \"Longformer-Deep\", increases the number of attention layers from L to kW, where k is a constant. Both variants obtain improvements on the WinoGrande, ARC-Easy, ARC-Challenge, and BoolQ datasets.\n\nThe paper \"BERT with Self-Calibrated Pooling\" by Koncel-Kedziorski et al. introduces a modification of the BERT model that replaces the max-pooling layer with a \"self-calibrated\" pooling layer. The intuition behind this change is that the max-pooling layer only considers the probability of the most likely word token, and ignores the other tokens in the list. The self-calibrated pooling layer, on the other hand, creates a distribution over the probability of each token appearing in the hidden state. The resulting model, called \"BSC-Pool\", obtains state-of-the-art results on the MNLI, QNLI, SST-2, and STS-B datasets.\n\nThe paper \"Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training\" by Radford et al. introduces a new language model called \"GPT-2\". GPT-2 is almost identical to the BERT model, except that GPT-2 uses the transformer decoder instead of the encoder. The authors train two versions of GPT-2, a smaller version with 117 million parameters, and a larger version with 800 million parameters. The larger GPT-2 model achieves new state-of-the-art results on several tasks, including: the text completion task, machine translation, and image captioning.\n\nThe paper \"Universal Language Model Re-ranking for Natural Language Inference\" by Wang et al. introduces a new model called \"MLMR\", short for \"Multi-Layer Model Re-Ranking\". The authors propose two approaches to improving natural language inference (NLI) models: a supervised approach and an unsupervised approach. The supervised approach involves training a re-ranker to choose among the top hypotheses produced by a weak NLI model. The unsupervised approach involves taking the hidden state of a strong NLI model and re-ranking the hypotheses by feeding them into a re-ranker model. The authors find that the unsupervised approach performs best, obtaining a new state-of-the-art result of 88.2 on the MNLI dataset.\n\nThe paper \"A Simple Neural Attentive Sentence Encoder\" by Yu et al. introduces a new language model architecture called \"ANSE\", short for \"Attentive Neural Sentence Encoder\". The authors note that ANSE is similar to the BiDAF model, except that ANSE uses a transformer-like architecture. The model uses two attention mechanisms: a character-to-word attention mechanism and a word-to-word attention mechanism. The resulting model achieves strong results on several tasks, including: question answering, textual entailment, and semantic textual similarity.\n\nNotes\n\n* \u2191\n  * \u2191\n  * \u2191\n  *

Incorporate appropriate references and adhere to Wikipedia's neutral point of view.", "input": "", "output": "Introduction\nThe transformer is a deep learning architecture that was developed by researchers at Google and is based on the multi-head attention mechanism, which was proposed in the 2017 paper \"Attention Is All You Need\". Text is converted to numerical representations called tokens, and each token is converted into a vector via lookup from a word embedding table. At each layer, each token is then contextualized within the scope of the context window with other (unmasked) tokens via a parallel multi-head attention mechanism, allowing the signal for key tokens to be amplified and less important tokens to be diminished.\nTransformers have the advantage of having no recurrent units, therefore requiring less training time than earlier recurrent neural architectures (RNNs) such as long short-term memory (LSTM). Later variations have been widely adopted for training large language models (LLM) on large (language) datasets.\n\nTransformers were first developed as an improvement over previous architectures for machine translation, but have found many applications since. They are used in large-scale natural language processing, computer vision (vision transformers), reinforcement learning, audio, multimodal learning, robotics, and even playing chess. It has also led to the development of pre-trained systems, such as generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs) and BERT (bidirectional encoder representations from transformers).History\nPredecessors\nFor many years, sequence modelling and generation was done by using plain recurrent neural networks (RNNs). A well-cited early example was the Elman network (1990). In theory, the information from one token can propagate arbitrarily far down the sequence, but in practice the vanishing-gradient problem leaves the model's state at the end of a long sentence without precise, extractable information about preceding tokens.\nA key breakthrough was LSTM (1995), a RNN which used various innovations to overcome the vanishing gradient problem, allowing efficient learning of long-sequence modelling. One key innovation was the use of an attention mechanism which used neurons that multiply the outputs of other neurons, so-called multiplicative units. Neural networks using multiplicative units were later called sigma-pi networks or higher-order networks. LSTM became the standard architecture for long sequence modelling until the 2017 publication of Transformers.\nHowever, LSTM still used sequential processing, like most other RNNs. Specifically, RNNs operate one token at a time from first to last; they cannot operate in parallel over all tokens in a sequence. \nModern Transformers overcome this problem, but unlike RNNs, they require computation time that is quadratic in the size of the context window. The linearly scaling fast weight controller (1992) learns to compute a weight matrix for further processing depending on the input. One of its two networks has \"fast weights\" or \"dynamic links\" (1981). A slow neural network learns by gradient descent to generate keys and values for computing the weight changes of the fast neural network which computes answers to queries. This was later shown to be equivalent to the unnormalized linear Transformer.Attention with seq2seq\nThe idea of encoder-decoder sequence transduction had been developed in the early 2010s (see previous papers). The papers most commonly cited as the originators that produced seq2seq are two concurrently published papers from 2014.\nA 380M-parameter model for machine translation uses two long short-term memories (LSTM). Its architecture consists of two parts. The encoder is an LSTM that takes in a sequence of tokens and turns it into a vector. The decoder is another LSTM that converts the vector into a sequence of tokens. Similarly, another 130M-parameter model used gated recurrent units (GRU) instead of LSTM. Later research showed that GRUs are neither better nor worse than LSTMs for seq2seq.\nThese early seq2seq models had no attention mechanism, and the state vector is accessible only after the last word of the source text was processed. Although in theory such a vector retains the information about the whole original sentence, in practice the information is poorly preserved. This is because the input is processed sequentially by one recurrent network into a fixed-size output vector, which is then processed by another recurrent network into an output. If the input is long, then the output vector would not be able to contain all relevant information, degrading the output. As evidence, reversing the input sentence improved seq2seq translation.\nThe RNNsearch model introduced an attention mechanism to seq2seq for machine translation to solve the bottleneck problem (of the fixed-size output vector), allowing the model to process long-distance dependencies more easily. The name is because it \"emulates searching through a source sentence during decoding a translation\".\nThe relative performances were compared between global (that of RNNsearch) and local (sliding window) attention model architectures for machine translation, finding that mixed attention had higher quality than global attention, while local attention reduced translation time.\nIn 2016, Google Translate was revamped to Google Neural Machine Translation, which replaced the previous model based on statistical machine translation. The new model was a seq2seq model where the encoder and the decoder were both 8 layers of bidirectional LSTM. It took nine months to develop, and it outperformed the statistical approach, which took ten years to develop.Parallelizing attention\nSeq2seq models with attention (including self-attention) still suffered from the same issue with recurrent networks, which is that they are hard to parallelize, which prevented them from being accelerated on GPUs. In 2016, decomposable attention applied a self-attention mechanism to feedforward networks, which are easy to parallelize, and achieved SOTA result in textual entailment with an order of magnitude fewer parameters than LSTMs. One of its authors, Jakob Uszkoreit, suspected that attention without recurrence is sufficient for language translation, thus the title \"attention is all you need\". That hypothesis was against conventional wisdom at the time, and even his father Hans Uszkoreit, a well-known computational linguist, was skeptical. In the same year, self-attention (called intra-attention or intra-sentence attention) was proposed for LSTMs.\nIn 2017, the original (100M-sized) encoder-decoder transformer model was proposed in the \"Attention is all you need\" paper. At the time, the focus of the research was on improving seq2seq for machine translation, by removing its recurrence to process all tokens in parallel, but preserving its dot-product attention mechanism to keep its text processing performance. This led to the introduction of a multi-head attention model that was easier to parallelize due to the use of independent heads and the lack of recurrence. Its parallelizability was an important factor to its widespread use in large neural networks.AI boom era\nAlready in spring 2017, even before the \"Attention is all you need\" preprint was published, one of the co-authors applied the \"decoder-only\" variation of the architecture to generate fictitious Wikipedia articles. Transformer architecture is now used alongside many generative models that contribute to the ongoing AI boom.\nIn language modelling, ELMo (2018) was a bi-directional LSTM that produces contextualized word embeddings, improving upon the line of research from bag of words and word2vec. It was followed by BERT (2018), an encoder-only Transformer model. In 2019 October, Google started using BERT to process search queries. In 2020, Google Translate replaced the previous RNN-encoder\u2013RNN-decoder model by a Transformer-encoder\u2013RNN-decoder model.\nStarting in 2018, the OpenAI GPT series of decoder-only Transformers became state of the art in natural language generation. In 2022, a chatbot based on GPT-3, ChatGPT, became unexpectedly popular, triggering a boom around large language models.\nSince 2020, Transformers have been applied in modalities beyond text, including the vision transformer, speech recognition, robotics, and multimodal. The vision transformer, in turn, stimulated new developments in convolutional neural networks. Image and video generators like DALL-E (2021), Stable Diffusion 3 (2024), and Sora (2024), use Transformers to analyse input data (like text prompts) by breaking it down into \"tokens\" and then calculating the relevance between each token using self-attention, which helps the model understand the context and relationships within the data.Training\nMethods for stabilizing training\nThe plain transformer architecture had difficulty converging. In the original paper the authors recommended using learning rate warmup. That is, the learning rate should linearly scale up from 0 to maximal value for the first part of the training (usually recommended to be 2% of the total number of training steps), before decaying again.\nA 2020 paper found that using layer normalization before (instead of after) multiheaded attention and feedforward layers stabilizes training, not requiring learning rate warmup.Pretrain-finetune\nTransformers typically are first pretrained by self-supervised learning on a large generic dataset, followed by supervised fine-tuning on a small task-specific dataset. The pretrain dataset is typically an unlabeled large corpus, such as The Pile. Tasks for pretraining and fine-tuning commonly include:\n\nlanguage modeling\nnext-sentence prediction\nquestion answering\nreading comprehension\nsentiment analysis\nparaphrasing\nThe T5 transformer report documents a large number of natural language pretraining tasks. Some examples are:\n\nrestoring or repairing incomplete or corrupted text. For example, the input, \"Thank you\u202f~~\u202fme to your party\u202f~~\u202fweek\", might generate the output, \"Thank you for inviting me to your party last week\".\ntranslation between natural languages (machine translation)\njudging the pragmatic acceptability of natural language. For example, the following sentence might be judged \"not acceptable\", because even though it is syntactically well-formed, it is improbable in ordinary human usage: The course is jumping well.\nNote that while each of these tasks is trivial or obvious for human native speakers of the language (or languages), they have typically proved challenging for previous generations of machine learning architecture.Tasks\nIn general, there are 3 classes of language modelling tasks: \"masked\", \"autoregressive\", and \"prefixLM\". These classes are independent of a specific modeling architecture such as Transformer, but they are often discussed in the context of Transformer.\nIn a masked task, one or more of the tokens is masked out, and the model would produce a probability distribution predicting what the masked-out tokens are based on the context. The loss function for the task is typically sum of log-perplexities for the masked-out tokens: \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          Loss\n        \n        =\n        \u2212\n        \n          \u2211\n          \n            t\n            \u2208\n            \n              masked tokens\n            \n          \n        \n        ln\n        \u2061\n        (\n        \n          probability of \n        \n        t\n        \n           conditional on its context\n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\text{Loss}}=-\\sum _{t\\in {\\text{masked tokens}}}\\ln({\\text{probability of }}t{\\text{ conditional on its context}})}\n  \nand the model is trained to minimize this loss function. The BERT series of models are trained for masked token prediction and another task.\nIn an autoregressive task, the entire sequence is masked at first, and the model produces a probability distribution for the first token. Then the first token is revealed and the model predicts the second token, and so on. The loss function for the task is still typically the same. The GPT series of models are trained by autoregressive tasks.\nIn a prefixLM task, the sequence is divided into two parts. The first part is presented as context, and the model predicts the first token of the second part. Then that would be revealed, and the model predicts the second token, and so on. The loss function for the task is still typically the same. The T5 series of models are trained by prefixLM tasks.\nNote that \"masked\" as in \"masked language modelling\" is not \"masked\" as in \"masked attention\", and \"prefixLM\" (prefix language modeling) is not \"prefixLM\" (prefix language model).Architecture\nAll transformers have the same primary components:\n\nTokenizers, which convert text into tokens.\nEmbedding layer, which converts tokens and positions of the tokens into vector representations.\nTransformer layers, which carry out repeated transformations on the vector representations, extracting more and more linguistic information. These consist of alternating attention and feedforward layers. There are two major types of transformer layers: encoder layers and decoder layers, with further variants.\nUn-embedding layer, which converts the final vector representations back to a probability distribution over the tokens.\nThe following description follows exactly the Transformer as described in the original paper. There are variants, described in the following section.\nBy convention, we write all vectors as row vectors. This, for example, means that pushing a vector through a linear layer means multiplying it by a weight matrix on the right, as \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n        W\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle xW}\n  \n.Tokenization\nAs the Transformer architecture natively processes numerical data, not text, there must be a translation between text and tokens. A token is an integer that represents a character, or a short segment of characters. On the input side, the input text is parsed into a token sequence. Similarly, on the output side, the output tokens are parsed back to text. The module doing the conversion between texts and token sequences is a tokenizer.\nThe set of all tokens is the vocabulary of the tokenizer, and its size is the vocabulary size \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          n\n          \n            vocabulary\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n_{\\text{vocabulary}}}\n  \n. When faced with tokens outside the vocabulary, typically a special token is used, written as \"[UNK]\" for \"unknown\".\nSome commonly used tokenizers are byte pair encoding, WordPiece, and SentencePiece.Embedding\nEach token is converted into an embedding vector via a lookup table. Equivalently stated, it multiplies a one-hot representation of the token by an embedding matrix \n  \n    \n      \n        M\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle M}\n  \n.

This shall induce a bias towards the order of the input sequence, so that, for example, the input sequence \"man bites dog\" is processed differently from \"dog bites man\".\nThe positional encoding is defined as a function of type \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        :\n        \n          R\n        \n        \u2192\n        \n          \n            R\n          \n          \n            d\n          \n        \n        ;\n        d\n        \u2208\n        \n          Z\n        \n        ,\n        d\n        >\n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f:\\mathbb {R} \\to \\mathbb {R} ^{d};d\\in \\mathbb {Z} ,d>0}\n  \n, where \n  \n    \n      \n        d\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle d}\n  \n is a positive even integer.

This allows the transformer to take any encoded position and find a linear sum of the encoded locations of its neighbors. This sum of encoded positions, when fed into the attention mechanism, would create attention weights on its neighbors, much like what happens in a convolutional neural network language model. In the author's words, \"we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by relative position.\"\nIn typical implementations, all operations are done over the real numbers, not the complex numbers, but since complex multiplication can be implemented as real 2-by-2 matrix multiplication, this is a mere notational difference.Encoder-decoder (overview)\nLike earlier seq2seq models, the original transformer model used an encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder consists of encoding layers that process all the input tokens together one layer after another, while the decoder consists of decoding layers that iteratively process the encoder's output and the decoder's output tokens so far.\nThe purpose of each encoder layer is to create contextualized representations of the tokens, where each representation corresponds to a token that \"mixes\" information from other input tokens via self-attention mechanism. Each decoder layer contains two attention sublayers: (1) cross-attention for incorporating the output of encoder (contextualized input token representations), and (2) self-attention for \"mixing\" information among the input tokens to the decoder (i.e. the tokens generated so far during inference time).\nBoth the encoder and decoder layers have a feed-forward neural network for additional processing of their outputs and contain residual connections and layer normalization steps. These feed-forward layers contain most of the parameters in a Transformer model.Feedforward network\nThe feedforward network (FFN) modules in a Transformer are 2-layered multilayer perceptrons:\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          F\n          F\n          N\n        \n        (\n        x\n        )\n        =\n        \u03d5\n        (\n        x\n        \n          W\n          \n            (\n            1\n            )\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          b\n          \n            (\n            1\n            )\n          \n        \n        )\n        \n          W\n          \n            (\n            2\n            )\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          b\n          \n            (\n            2\n            )\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {FFN} (x)=\\phi (xW^{(1)}+b^{(1)})W^{(2)}+b^{(2)}}\n  \nwhere \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          W\n          \n            (\n            1\n            )\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle W^{(1)}}\n  \n and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          W\n          \n            (\n            2\n            )\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle W^{(2)}}\n  \n are weight matrices and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          b\n          \n            (\n            1\n            )\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle b^{(1)}}\n  \n and  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          b\n          \n            (\n            2\n            )\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle b^{(2)}}\n  \n are bias vectors, and \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03d5\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\phi }\n  \n is its activation function.

It is theoretically possible for all three to be different, but that is rarely the case in practice.Multiheaded attention\nOne set of \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          (\n          \n            \n              W\n              \n                Q\n              \n            \n            ,\n            \n              W\n              \n                K\n              \n            \n            ,\n            \n              W\n              \n                V\n              \n            \n          \n          )\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\left(W^{Q},W^{K},W^{V}\\right)}\n  \n matrices is called an attention head, and each layer in a transformer model has multiple attention heads. While each attention head attends to the tokens that are relevant to each token, multiple attention heads allow the model to do this for different definitions of \"relevance\". Specifically, the query and key projection matrices, \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          W\n          \n            Q\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle W^{Q}}\n  \n and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          W\n          \n            K\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle W^{K}}\n  \n , which are involved in the attention score computation, defines the \"relevance\". Meanwhile, the value projection matrix \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          W\n          \n            V\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle W^{V}}\n  \n, in combination with the part of the output projection matrix \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          W\n          \n            O\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle W^{O}}\n  \n, determines how the attended tokens influence what information is passed to subsequent layers and ultimately the output logits. In addition, the scope of attention, or the range of token relationships captured by each attention head, can expand as tokens pass through successive layers. This allows the model to capture more complex and long-range dependencies in deeper layers. Many transformer attention heads encode relevance relations that are meaningful to humans. For example, some attention heads can attend mostly to the next word, while others mainly attend from verbs to their direct objects. The computations for each attention head can be performed in parallel, which allows for fast processing. The outputs for the attention layer are concatenated to pass into the feed-forward neural network layers.\nConcretely, let the multiple attention heads be indexed by \n  \n    \n      \n        i\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i}\n  \n, then we have\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          MultiheadedAttention\n        \n        (\n        Q\n        ,\n        K\n        ,\n        V\n        )\n        =\n        \n          \n            Concat\n          \n          \n            i\n            \u2208\n            [\n            \n              n\n              \n                heads\n              \n            \n            ]\n          \n        \n        (\n        \n          Attention\n        \n        (\n        Q\n        \n          W\n          \n            i\n          \n          \n            Q\n          \n        \n        ,\n        K\n        \n          W\n          \n            i\n          \n          \n            K\n          \n        \n        ,\n        V\n        \n          W\n          \n            i\n          \n          \n            V\n          \n        \n        )\n        )\n        \n          W\n          \n            O\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\text{MultiheadedAttention}}(Q,K,V)={\\text{Concat}}_{i\\in [n_{\\text{heads}}]}({\\text{Attention}}(QW_{i}^{Q},KW_{i}^{K},VW_{i}^{V}))W^{O}}\n  \n where the matrix \n  \n    \n      \n        X\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle X}\n  \n is the concatenation of word embeddings, and the matrices \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          W\n          \n            i\n          \n          \n            Q\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          W\n          \n            i\n          \n          \n            K\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          W\n          \n            i\n          \n          \n            V\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle W_{i}^{Q},W_{i}^{K},W_{i}^{V}}\n  \n are \"projection matrices\" owned by individual attention head \n  \n    \n      \n        i\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i}\n  \n, and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          W\n          \n            O\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle W^{O}}\n  \n is a final projection matrix owned by the whole multi-headed attention head.\nIt is theoretically possible for each attention head to have a different head dimension \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          d\n          \n            head\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle d_{\\text{head}}}\n  \n, but that is rarely the case in practice.\nAs an example, in the smallest GPT-2 model, there are only self-attention mechanisms.

The first encoder layer takes the sequence of input vectors from the embedding layer, producing a sequence of vectors. This sequence of vectors is processed by the second encoder, and so on. The output from the final encoder layer is then used by the decoder.\nAs the encoder processes the entire input all at once, every token can attend to every other token (all-to-all attention), so there is no need for causal masking.Decoder\nA decoder consists of an embedding layer, followed by multiple decoder layers, followed by an un-embedding layer.\nEach decoder consists of three major components: a causally masked self-attention mechanism, a cross-attention mechanism, and a feed-forward neural network. The decoder functions in a similar fashion to the encoder, but an additional attention mechanism is inserted which instead draws relevant information from the encodings generated by the encoders. This mechanism can also be called the encoder-decoder attention.\nLike the first encoder, the first decoder takes positional information and embeddings of the output sequence as its input, rather than encodings. The transformer must not use the current or future output to predict an output, so the output sequence must be partially masked to prevent this reverse information flow. This allows for autoregressive text generation. For decoding, all-to-all attention is inappropriate, because a token cannot attend to tokens not yet generated. Thus, the self-attention module in the decoder is causally masked.\nIn contrast, the cross-attention mechanism attends to the output vectors of the encoder, which is computed before the decoder starts decoding. Consequently, there is no need for masking in the cross-attention mechanism.\nSchematically, we have:\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                \n                  H\n                  \u2032\n                \n              \n              \n                \n                =\n                \n                  MaskedMultiheadedAttention\n                \n                (\n                H\n                ,\n                H\n                ,\n                H\n                )\n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  DecoderLayer\n                \n                (\n                H\n                )\n              \n              \n                \n                =\n                \n                  FFN\n                \n                (\n                \n                  MultiheadedAttention\n                \n                (\n                \n                  H\n                  \u2032\n                \n                ,\n                \n                  H\n                  \n                    E\n                  \n                \n                ,\n                \n                  H\n                  \n                    E\n                  \n                \n                )\n                )\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\begin{aligned}H'&={\\text{MaskedMultiheadedAttention}}(H,H,H)\\\\{\\text{DecoderLayer}}(H)&={\\text{FFN}}({\\text{MultiheadedAttention}}(H',H^{E},H^{E}))\\end{aligned}}}\n  \nwhere \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          H\n          \n            E\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle H^{E}}\n  \n is the matrix with rows being the output vectors from the encoder.\nThe last decoder is followed by a final un-embedding layer. to produce the output probabilities over the vocabulary. Then, one of the tokens is sampled according to the probability, and the decoder can be run again to produce the next token, etc, autoregressively generating output text.Adapted architectures\nMany large language models, since they do not need to predict a whole new sequence from an input sequence, only use the encoder or decoder of the original transformer architecture. Early GPT models are decoder-only models trained to predict the next token in a sequence. BERT, another language model, only makes use of an encoder, and is trained to predict a randomly masked token in a sequence.Full transformer architecture\nSublayers\nEach encoder layer contains 2 sublayers: the self-attention and the feedforward network. Each decoder layer contains 3 sublayers: the causally masked self-attention, the cross-attention, and the feedforward network.\n\nThe final points of detail are the residual connections and layer normalization (LayerNorm, or LN), which while conceptually unnecessary, are necessary for numerical stability and convergence.  \nThe residual connection, which is introduced to avoid vanishing gradient issues and stabilize the training process, can be expressed as follows: y = F(x) + x. The expression indicates that an output y is the sum of the transformation of input x (F(x)) and the input itself (x). Adding the input x can preserve the input information and avoid issues when the gradient of F(x) is close to zero.  \nSimilarly to how the feedforward network modules are applied individually to each vector, the LayerNorm is also applied individually to each vector. \nThere are two common conventions in use: the post-LN and the pre-LN convention.

The pre-LN convention, proposed several times in 2018, was found to be easier to train, requiring no warm-up, leading to faster convergence.Pseudocode\nThe following is the pseudocode for a standard pre-LN encoder-decoder Transformer, adapted from\n\ninput: Encoder input t_e\n       Decoder input t_d\noutput: Array of probability distributions, with shape (decoder vocabulary size x length(decoder output sequence))\n\n/* encoder */\nz_e \u2190 encoder.tokenizer(t_e)\n\nfor each t in 1:length(z_e) do\n    z_e[t] \u2190 encoder.embedding(z_e[t]) + encoder.positional_embedding(t)\n\nfor each l in 1:length(encoder.layers) do\n    layer \u2190 encoder.layers[l]\n\n    /* first sublayer */\n    z_e_copy \u2190 copy(z_e)\n    for each t in 1:length(z_e) do\n        z_e[t] \u2190 layer.layer_norm(z_e[t])\n    z_e \u2190 layer.multiheaded_attention(z_e, z_e, z_e)\n    for each t in 1:length(z_e) do\n        z_e[t] \u2190 z_e[t] + z_e_copy[t]\n\n    /* second sublayer */\n    z_e_copy \u2190 copy(z_e)\n    for each t in 1:length(z_e) do\n        z_e[t] \u2190 layer.layer_norm(z_e[t])\n    z_e \u2190 layer.feedforward(z_e)\n    for each t in 1:length(z_e) do\n        z_e[t] \u2190 z_e[t] + z_e_copy[t]\n\nfor each t in 1:length(z_e) do\n    z_e[t] \u2190 encoder.final_layer_norm(z_e[t])\n\n/* decoder */\nz_d \u2190 decoder.tokenizer(t_d)\n\nfor each t in 1:length(z_d) do\n    z_d[t] \u2190 decoder.embedding(z_d[t]) + decoder.positional_embedding(t)\n\nfor each l in 1:length(decoder.layers) do\n        layer \u2190 decoder.layers[l]\n\n        /* first sublayer */\n        z_d_copy \u2190 copy(z_d)\n        for each t in 1:length(z_d) do\n            z_d[t] \u2190 layer.layer_norm(z_d[t])\n        z_d \u2190 layer.masked_multiheaded_attention(z_d, z_d, z_d)\n        for each t in 1:length(z_d) do\n            z_d[t] \u2190 z_d[t] + z_d_copy[t]\n\n        /* second sublayer */\n        z_d_copy \u2190 copy(z_d)\n        for each t in 1:length(z_d) do\n            z_d[t] \u2190 layer.layer_norm(z_d[t])\n        z_d \u2190 layer.multiheaded_attention(z_d, z_e, z_e) \n        for each i in 1:length(z_d) do\n            z_d[t] \u2190 z_d[t] + z_d_copy[t]\n\n        /* third sublayer */\n        z_d_copy \u2190 copy(z_d)\n        for each t in 1:length(z_d) do\n            z_d[t] \u2190 layer.layer_norm(z_d[t])\n        z_d \u2190 layer.feedforward(z_d)\n        for each t in 1:length(z_d) do\n            z_d[t] \u2190 z_d[t] + z_d_copy[t]\n\nz_d \u2190 decoder.final_layer_norm(z_d)\n\noutput_distributions \u2190 []\nfor each t in 1:length(z_d) do\n    output_distributions.append(decoder.unembed(z_d[t]))\n\nreturn output_distributionsTerminology\nThe Transformer architecture, being modular, allows variations. Several common variations are described here.\nAn \"encoder-only\" Transformer applies the encoder to map an input text into a sequence of vectors that represent the input text. This is usually used for text embedding and representation learning for downstream applications. BERT is encoder-only. They are less often used currently, as they were found to be not significantly better than training an encoder-decoder Transformer, then taking just the encoder.\nA \"decoder-only\" Transformer is not literally decoder-only, since without an encoder, the cross-attention mechanism has nothing to attend to. Thus, the decoder layers in a decoder-only Transformer is composed of just two sublayers: the causally masked self-attention, and the feedforward network. This is usually used for text generation and instruction following. The models in the GPT series and Chinchilla series are decoder-only.\nAn \"encoder-decoder\" Transformer is generally the same as the original Transformer, with 2 sublayers per encoder layer and 3 sublayers per decoder layer, etc. They might have minor architectural improvements, such as alternative activation functions, changing the location of normalization, etc. This is also usually used for text generation and instruction following. The models in the T5 series are encoder-decoder.\nA \"prefixLM\" (prefix language model) is a decoder-only architecture, but with prefix masking, which is different from causal masking. Specifically, it has mask of the form:\u200aFigure 3\u200a\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          M\n          \n            prefixLM\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            [\n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    0\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \u2212\n                  \u221e\n                \n              \n              \n                \n                  \n                    0\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    M\n                    \n                      causal\n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n            ]\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle M_{\\text{prefixLM}}={\\begin{bmatrix}\\mathbf {0} &-\\infty \\\\\\mathbf {0} &M_{\\text{causal}}\\end{bmatrix}}}\n  \nwhere the first columns correspond to the \"prefix\", and the subsequent columns correspond to the autoregressively generated text based on the prefix. They resemble encoder-decoder models, but has less \"sparsity\". Such models are rarely used, though they are cited as theoretical possibilities and benchmarked comparisons.\nThere are also mixed seq2seq models. For example, in 2020, Google Translate replaced the previous RNN-encoder\u2013RNN-decoder model by a Transformer-encoder\u2013RNN-decoder model, on the argument that an RNN-decoder runs much faster than Transformer-decoder when run autoregressively.Subsequent work\nAlternative activation functions\nThe original transformer uses ReLU activation function. Other activation functions were developed. The Llama series and PaLM used SwiGLU; both GPT-1 and BERT used GELU. \nAlternative activation functions are often used in combination with Gated Linear Units in the feedforward module.Alternative normalizations\nThe normalization used in the Transformer can be different from LayerNorm. One example is RMSNorm which is used in the Llama series. Other examples include CapsuleNorm ScaleNorm, or FixNorm.Alternative positional encodings\nTransformers may use other positional encoding methods than sinusoidal. \nThe original Transformer paper reported using a learned positional encoding, but finding it not superior to the sinusoidal one. Later,  found that causal masking itself provides enough signal to a Transformer decoder that it can learn to implicitly perform absolute positional encoding without the positional encoding module.RoPE\nRoPE (rotary positional embedding), is best explained by considering a list of 2-dimensional vectors \n  \n    \n      \n        [\n        (\n        \n          x\n          \n            1\n          \n          \n            (\n            1\n            )\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          x\n          \n            1\n          \n          \n            (\n            2\n            )\n          \n        \n        )\n        ,\n        (\n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n          \n            (\n            1\n            )\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n          \n            (\n            2\n            )\n          \n        \n        )\n        ,\n        (\n        \n          x\n          \n            3\n          \n          \n            (\n            1\n            )\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          x\n          \n            3\n          \n          \n            (\n            2\n            )\n          \n        \n        )\n        ,\n        .\n        .\n        .\n        ]\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle [(x_{1}^{(1)},x_{1}^{(2)}),(x_{2}^{(1)},x_{2}^{(2)}),(x_{3}^{(1)},x_{3}^{(2)}),...]}\n  \n.

Since it is directly plugged into the attention mechanism, it can be combined with any positional encoder that is plugged into the \"bottom\" of the entire network (which is where the sinusoidal encoder on the original transformer, as well as RoPE and many others, are located).Relative Position Encodings\nRelative Position Encodings is similar to ALiBi, but more generic:\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                \n                  Attention\n                \n                (\n                Q\n                ,\n                K\n                ,\n                V\n                )\n                =\n                \n                  softmax\n                \n                \n                  (\n                  \n                    \n                      \n                        \n                          Q\n                          \n                            K\n                            \n                              \n                                T\n                              \n                            \n                          \n                        \n                        \n                          \n                            d\n                            \n                              k\n                            \n                          \n                        \n                      \n                    \n                    +\n                    B\n                  \n                  )\n                \n                V\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\begin{aligned}{\\text{Attention}}(Q,K,V)={\\text{softmax}}\\left({\\frac {QK^{\\mathrm {T} }}{\\sqrt {d_{k}}}}+B\\right)V\\end{aligned}}}\n  \nwhere \n  \n    \n      \n        B\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle B}\n  \n is a Toeplitz matrix, that is, \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          B\n          \n            i\n            ,\n            j\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          B\n          \n            \n              i\n              \u2032\n            \n            ,\n            \n              j\n              \u2032\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle B_{i,j}=B_{i',j'}}\n  \n whenever \n  \n    \n      \n        i\n        \u2212\n        j\n        =\n        \n          i\n          \u2032\n        \n        \u2212\n        \n          j\n          \u2032\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i-j=i'-j'}\n  \n. This is contrasted with the original sinusoidal positional encoding, which is an \"absolute positional encoding\".Efficient implementation\nThe transformer model has been implemented in standard deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch. Transformers is a library produced by Hugging Face that supplies transformer-based architectures and pretrained models.KV caching\nWhen an autoregressive transformer is used for inference, such as generating text, the query vector is different at each step, but the already-computed key and value vectors are always the same. The KV caching method saves the computed key and value vectors at each attention block, so that they are not recomputed at each new token. PagedAttention applies memory paging to KV caching.\nIf a transformer is used with a baked-in prompt, such as [\"You are a customer support agent...\"], then the key and value vectors can be computed for the prompt, and saved on disk. The saving in compute is significant when the model is used for many short interactions, such as in online chatbots.FlashAttention\nFlashAttention is an algorithm that implements the transformer attention mechanism efficiently on a GPU. It is a communication-avoiding algorithm that performs matrix multiplications in blocks, such that each block fits within the cache of a GPU, and by careful management of the blocks it minimizes data copying between GPU caches (as data movement is slow). See the page on softmax for details.\nAn improved version, FlashAttention-2, was developed to cater to the rising demand for language models capable of handling longer context lengths. It offers enhancements in work partitioning and parallelism, enabling it to achieve up to 230 TFLOPs/s on A100 GPUs (FP16/BF16), a 2x speed increase over the original FlashAttention.\nKey advancements in FlashAttention-2 include the reduction of non-matmul FLOPs, improved parallelism over the sequence length dimension, better work partitioning between GPU warps, and added support for head dimensions up to 256 and multi-query attention (MQA) and grouped-query attention (GQA).\nBenchmarks revealed FlashAttention-2 to be up to 2x faster than FlashAttention and up to 9x faster than a standard attention implementation in PyTorch. Future developments include optimization for new hardware like H100 GPUs and new data types like FP8.Multi-Query Attention\nMulti-Query Attention changes the multiheaded attention mechanism.

MQA is GQA with one group, while standard multiheaded attention is GQA with the maximal number of groups.\n\nMultihead Latent Attention (MLA) is a low-rank approximation to standard MHA. Specifically, each hidden vector, before entering the attention mechanism, is first projected to two low-dimensional spaces (\"latent space\"), one for query and one for key-value (KV vector). This design minimizes the KV cache, as only the low-dimensional KV vector needs to be cached.Speculative decoding\nSpeculative decoding is a method to accelerate token decoding. Similarly to speculative execution in CPUs, future tokens are computed quickly, then verified. If the quickly computed tokens are incorrect, they are discarded and computed slowly.\nThe key factor in speculative decoding is that a Transformer decoder can verify faster than it can decode, in the following sense.\nSuppose we have two transformer models like GPT-3 and GPT-3-small, both with a context window size of 512. To generate an entire context window autoregressively with greedy decoding with GPT-3, it must be run for 512 times, each time generating a token \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          x\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        ,\n        .\n        .\n        .\n        ,\n        \n          x\n          \n            512\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{512}}\n  \n, taking time \n  \n    \n      \n        512\n        \n          T\n          \n            GPT-3\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 512T_{\\text{GPT-3}}}\n  \n. However, if we had some educated guess for the values of these tokens, we could verify all of them in parallel, in one run of the model, by checking that each \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          x\n          \n            t\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x_{t}}\n  \n is indeed the token with the largest log-likelihood in the \n  \n    \n      \n        t\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle t}\n  \n-th output.\nIn speculative decoding, a smaller model or some other simple heuristic is used to generate a few speculative tokens that are subsequently verified by the larger model. For example, suppose we use GPT-3-small to generate four speculative tokens: \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                x\n                ~\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          \n            \n              \n                x\n                ~\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          \n            \n              \n                x\n                ~\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            3\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          \n            \n              \n                x\n                ~\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            4\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\tilde {x}}_{1},{\\tilde {x}}_{2},{\\tilde {x}}_{3},{\\tilde {x}}_{4}}\n  \n.

However, that vector can then be further processed by another Transformer block to predict the next token, and so on for arbitrarily many steps into the future. This trades off accuracy for speed, since each new token costs just one more Transformer block, rather than the entire stack.Sub-quadratic transformers\nTraining transformer-based architectures can be expensive, especially for long inputs. Many methods have been developed to attempt to address the issue. In the image domain, Swin Transformer is an efficient architecture that performs attention inside shifting windows. In the audio domain, SepTr decouples the attention in time and frequency domains. Long Range Arena (2020) is a standard benchmark for comparing the behavior of transformer architectures over long inputs.Alternative attention graphs\nThe standard attention graph is either all-to-all or causal, both of which scales as \n  \n    \n      \n        O\n        (\n        \n          N\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle O(N^{2})}\n  \n where \n  \n    \n      \n        N\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle N}\n  \n is the number of tokens in a sequence.\nReformer (2020) reduces the computational load from \n  \n    \n      \n        O\n        (\n        \n          N\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle O(N^{2})}\n  \n to \n  \n    \n      \n        O\n        (\n        N\n        ln\n        \u2061\n        N\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle O(N\\ln N)}\n  \n by using locality-sensitive hashing and reversible layers. \nSparse attention uses attention graphs that grows slower than \n  \n    \n      \n        O\n        (\n        \n          N\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle O(N^{2})}\n  \n. For example, BigBird (2020) uses random small-world networks which grows as \n  \n    \n      \n        O\n        (\n        N\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle O(N)}\n  \n.\nOrdinary transformers require a memory size that is quadratic in the size of the context window. Attention-free transformers reduce this to a linear dependence while still retaining the advantages of a transformer by linking the key to the value.Random Feature Attention\nRandom Feature Attention (2021) uses Fourier random features:\n  \n    \n      \n        \u03c6\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        =\n        \n          \n            1\n            \n              D\n            \n          \n        \n        [\n        cos\n        \u2061\n        \u27e8\n        \n          w\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        x\n        \u27e9\n        ,\n        sin\n        \u2061\n        \u27e8\n        \n          w\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        x\n        \u27e9\n        ,\n        \u22ef\n        cos\n        \u2061\n        \u27e8\n        \n          w\n          \n            D\n          \n        \n        ,\n        x\n        \u27e9\n        ,\n        sin\n        \u2061\n        \u27e8\n        \n          w\n          \n            D\n          \n        \n        ,\n        x\n        \u27e9\n        \n          ]\n          \n            T\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\varphi (x)={\\frac {1}{\\sqrt {D}}}[\\cos \\langle w_{1},x\\rangle ,\\sin \\langle w_{1},x\\rangle ,\\cdots \\cos \\langle w_{D},x\\rangle ,\\sin \\langle w_{D},x\\rangle ]^{T}}\n  \nwhere \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          w\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        .\n        .\n        .\n        ,\n        \n          w\n          \n            D\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle w_{1},...,w_{D}}\n  \n are independent samples from the normal distribution \n  \n    \n      \n        N\n        (\n        0\n        ,\n        \n          \u03c3\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        I\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle N(0,\\sigma ^{2}I)}\n  \n.

A 2022 study found that Transformers pretrained only on natural language can be finetuned on only 0.03% of parameters and become competitive with LSTMs on a variety of logical and visual tasks, demonstrating transfer learning. The LLaVA was a vision-language model composed of a language model (Vicuna-13B) and a vision model (ViT-L/14), connected by a linear layer. Only the linear layer is finetuned.\nVision transformers adapt the transformer to computer vision by breaking down input images as a series of patches, turning them into vectors, and treating them like tokens in a standard transformer.\nConformer and later Whisper follow the same pattern for speech recognition, first turning the speech signal into a spectrogram, which is then treated like an image, i.e. broken down into a series of patches, turned into vectors and treated like tokens in a standard transformer.\nPerceivers are a variant of Transformers designed for multimodality.\nFor image generation, notable architectures are DALL-E 1 (2021), Parti (2022), Phenaki (2023), and Muse (2023). Unlike later models, DALL-E is not a diffusion model. Instead, it uses a decoder-only Transformer that autoregressively generates a text, followed by the token representation of an image, which is then converted by a variational autoencoder to an image. Parti is an encoder-decoder Transformer, where the encoder processes a text prompt, and the decoder generates a token representation of an image. Muse is an encoder-only Transformer that is trained to predict masked image tokens from unmasked image tokens. During generation, all input tokens are masked, and the highest-confidence predictions are included for the next iteration, until all tokens are predicted. Phenaki is a text-to-video model. It is a bidirectional masked transformer conditioned on pre-computed text tokens. The generated tokens are then decoded to a video.Applications\nThe transformer has had great success in natural language processing (NLP). Many large language models such as GPT-2, GPT-3, GPT-4, Gemini, AlbertAGPT, Claude, BERT, Grok, XLNet, RoBERTa and ChatGPT demonstrate the ability of transformers to perform a wide variety of NLP-related subtasks and their related real-world applications, including:\n\nmachine translation\ntime series prediction\ndocument summarization\ndocument generation\nnamed entity recognition (NER)\nwriting computer code based on requirements expressed in natural language.\nspeech-to-text\nBeyond traditional NLP, the transformer architecture has had success in other applications, such as:\n\nbiological sequence analysis\nvideo understanding\nprotein folding (such as AlphaFold)\nevaluating chess board positions. Using static evaluation alone (that is, with no Minimax search) transformer achieved an Elo of 2895, putting it at grandmaster level.See also\nseq2seq \u2013 Family of machine learning approaches\nPerceiver \u2013 Variant of Transformer designed for multimodal data\nVision transformer \u2013 Machine learning model for vision processing\nLarge language model \u2013 Type of machine learning model\nBERT (language model) \u2013 Series of language models developed by Google AI\nGenerative pre-trained transformer \u2013 Type of large language model\nT5 (language model) \u2013 Series of large language models developed by Google AINotes\nReferences\n== Further reading ==", "result": "# Transformer (deep learning architecture)\n\nIn deep learning, the transformer is a deep-learning architecture introduced in 2017, named for its use of self-attention mechanisms to weight input data (such as the tokens of a sequence of text) prior to processing it further; this allows it to focus on relevant portions of the input when producing a corresponding output (such as the next token in a predicted sequence). It is primarily used in natural language processing (NLP), where it has proved very successful in sequence-to-sequence learning such as machine translation, and in multimodal tasks such as image captioning. As of 2024, transformer-based models are the most widely used architecture for training large language models (LLMs), having largely replaced recurrent neural networks (RNNs) such as LSTMs and GRUs.\n\nTransformers are usually implemented as a sequence of stacked \"layers\", each of which consists of multiple self-attention heads (a form of multi-way interaction mechanism) augmented by feedforward neural networks (FFNs). Each layer is followed by layer normalization, a form of batch normalization. Transformers are usually trained using the masked autoencoder training objective, whereby the model is trained to predict portions of the input sequence which have been masked out (randomly removed) from the input.\n\nTraining a transformer requires much less training time than an equivalent RNN-based model, but consumes much more memory per step. They are difficult to train on consumer hardware such as GPUs and are usually trained on custom-designed data centers using thousands of high-end GPUs. However, the relatively low parallelizability of the attention mechanism has recently been the target of various research efforts, and substantial progress has been made in training comparable models in a fraction of the time required by the original transformer architecture.\n\nA variant of the transformer architecture called the decoder-only transformer is the basis of the GPT series of large language models from OpenAI, while a variant of the encoder-only transformer is the basis of the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model. Combined encoder\u2013decoder transformers are the basis of the T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) model and the conversational transformer architecture. The decoder-only variant is also the basis of the ChatGPT model, and the encoder\u2013decoder variant is the basis of the Claude model from Anthropic.\n\nPretrained transformers are now ubiquitously used in natural language processing, and have been used for a variety of tasks ranging from simple text classification to complex tasks such as machine translation, question answering, and text summarization.\n\n History\n\nThe transformer model was introduced in the 2017 paper \"Attention Is All You Need\" by a team of researchers from Google Brain. The paper introduced the model as an alternative to recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for handling sequential data.\n\nPredecessors\n\nEarly models for sequence modeling included recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which maintained a hidden state that was transformed by the weights of the network at each step of the sequence. The difficulty of training RNNs due to the vanishing gradient problem limited their effectiveness, although long short-term memory (LSTM) networks and gated recurrent units (GRUs) ameliorated this to some degree by introducing gating mechanisms that allowed them to learn longer-range dependence in sequences.\n\nAnother approach to sequence modeling was to frame the problem as a form of machine translation and apply sequence-to-sequence learning with LSTM networks. This approach was used in the winning solution to the International Grapheme/Phoneme Challenge in 2015. This approach was limited by the fact that it trained the model with teacher forcing: the ground truth of the next element in the sequence was fed into the network as input when computing the next output element, instead of the actual output of the network being used as input for the next step. This prevented it from being truly probabilistic and from making long-range predictions about the sequence.\n\nIn 2016, Vaswani et al. proposed a new architecture based on self-attention mechanisms and reported superior performance on a range of NLP tasks. This architecture, dubbed the \"transformer\", was inspired by the human visual system's ability to focus on particular words or parts of a sentence when reading. The attention mechanism allowed the model to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence when producing an output, enabling it to focus on relevant portions of the input when generating output.\n\nAttention with seq2seq\n\nThe idea of using self-attention as a replacement for recurrent neural networks had already been proposed in the sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model, a model that is commonly used for machine translation and speech recognition. The seq2seq model consists of an encoder that reads an input sequence and produces a context vector, and a decoder that generates an output sequence using the context vector as input. The self-attention mechanism allows the decoder to attend to different parts of the input sequence when generating each output token, rather than relying on the context vector alone.\n\nAlthough the use of attention in the seq2seq model solved the problem of training with teacher forcing, it increased the computational complexity of the model, as computing the attention scores for each token in the sequence required comparing every pair of tokens. This made the model difficult to train on long sequences, limiting its usefulness.\n\nTo address this problem, Vaswani et al. proposed using a variant of the attention mechanism called multi-headed attention, which computes several attention scores in parallel using multiple attention \"heads\". This allows the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence simultaneously, reducing the computational complexity of the attention mechanism and enabling the model to handle longer sequences.\n\nThe transformer architecture also incorporates positional encoding to the input embeddings, which provides information about the position of each token in the sequence. This is necessary because the self-attention mechanism itself does not have access to the order of the tokens in the sequence. Positional encoding can be added to the input embeddings either by adding or multiplying them with a matrix of positional encodings. In the original transformer architecture, sinusoidal positional encodings were used, which were capable of scaling to an arbitrary length of sequence.\n\nIn practice, the positional encoding is often computed as a separate vector of the same length as the input sequence, and added to the input embeddings before feeding them into the self-attention mechanism.\n\n Encoder-decoder (overview)\n\nThe encoder-decoder architecture is a common architecture in NLP, which is used in machine translation, text summarization, and other tasks where the goal is to map between two different sequences of tokens. The encoder takes as input a sequence of tokens and produces a sequence of context vectors, one for each token in the input sequence. The decoder then generates an output sequence of tokens, conditioned on the context vectors produced by the encoder.\n\nThe transformer architecture is a variant of the encoder-decoder architecture that uses self-attention mechanisms in both the encoder and decoder. The self-attention mechanism allows the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence when producing each output token, enabling it to focus on relevant portions of the input when generating output.\n\nThe encoder consists of a stack of identical layers, each of which consists of a multi-headed self-attention mechanism followed by a feed-forward neural network. The self-attention mechanism computes a weighted sum of the context vectors produced by the encoder, where the weights are determined by the attention scores computed by the mechanism. The feed-forward network is a fully connected neural network that transforms the output of the self-attention mechanism.\n\nThe decoder also consists of a stack of identical layers, but the architecture is slightly different from that of the encoder. The decoder begins with a start-of-sequence token, which is fed into the first layer of the decoder. Each subsequent layer in the decoder computes a weighted sum of the context vectors produced by the encoder, where the weights are determined by the attention scores computed by the mechanism. The decoder also uses a second type of attention mechanism, called cross-attention, which allows the decoder to attend to the output sequence that has been generated so far. This enables the decoder to generate a sequence of tokens that is consistent with the input sequence.\n\nThe output of the last layer of the decoder is passed through a softmax layer, which produces a probability distribution over the possible output tokens. The token with the highest probability is then selected as the next token in the output sequence, and is fed back into the decoder as input for the next step.\n\n Feedforward network\n\nThe feedforward network is a sub-component of the transformer architecture that is responsible for processing the output of the self-attention mechanism. It consists of a fully connected neural network with two hidden layers, followed by a rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function. The ReLU activation function is used to introduce non-linearity into the network, allowing it to learn complex patterns in the data.\n\nThe input to the feedforward network is the output of the self-attention mechanism, which is a vector of dimensionality d_model. The output of the feedforward network is a vector of the same dimensionality, which is then added to the output of the self-attention mechanism to produce the final output of the layer. The weights and biases of the feedforward network are learned during training, along with the weights of the self-attention mechanism.\n\nThe feedforward network is applied separately to each position in the input sequence, meaning that the network is not shared across positions. This allows the model to learn different transformations for each position in the input sequence, enabling it to attend to different parts of the sequence when generating output.\n\n Scaled dot-product attention\n\nThe attention mechanism used in the transformer architecture is called the scaled dot-product attention. It is a mechanism for weighting the input data in order to emphasize the most important portions of the data when processing it further. The attention mechanism is used in both the encoder and decoder of the transformer architecture.\n\nThe scaled dot-product attention is defined as follows:\n\n    $\\operatorname {Attention} (Q,K,V)={\\text{softmax}}\\left({\\frac {QK^{T}}{\\sqrt {d_{k}}}}\\right)V$\n\nwhere Q, K, and V are the query, key, and value vectors, respectively, and d_k is the dimensionality of the key vectors. The query vector is obtained by transforming the input of the current layer using the weight matrix W_Q, while the key and value vectors are obtained by transforming the output of the previous layer using the weight matrices W_K and W_V, respectively.\n\nThe attention mechanism computes a weighted sum of the value vectors, where the weights are determined by the attention scores computed by the mechanism. The attention scores are computed by taking the dot product of the query vector with each key vector, scaling the result by the square root of the dimensionality of the key vectors, and applying the softmax function to obtain a probability distribution over the keys.\n\nThe scaled dot-product attention is a computationally efficient attention mechanism that has proven to be effective in a wide range of tasks. It has become a standard component of many transformer-based models, including the GPT and BERT models.\n\n Attention head\n\nThe attention mechanism used in the transformer architecture is a form of self-attention, which allows the model to weigh the importance of different portions of the input data when processing it. The attention mechanism is defined as follows:\n\n    $\\operatorname {Attention} (Q,K,V)={\\text{softmax}}(QK^{T}/\\sqrt {d_{k}})V$\n\nwhere Q, K, and V are the query, key, and value vectors, respectively, and d_k is the dimensionality of the key vectors.\n\nThe query vector is obtained by transforming the input of the current layer using the weight matrix W_Q, while the key and value vectors are obtained by transforming the output of the previous layer using the weight matrices W_K and W_V, respectively.\n\nThe attention mechanism computes a weighted sum of the value vectors, where the weights are determined by the attention scores computed by the mechanism. The attention scores are computed by taking the dot product of the query vector with each key vector, scaling the result by the square root of the dimensionality of the key vectors, and applying the softmax function to obtain a probability distribution over the keys.\n\nThe attention mechanism is used in the transformer architecture to allow the model to attend to different portions of the input data when processing it. By weighing the importance of different portions of the input data, the attention mechanism allows the model to focus on the most relevant portions of the data when generating output.\n\nMultiheaded attention\n\nThe attention mechanism used in the transformer architecture is a form of multiheaded attention, which allows the model to attend to different portions of the input data using multiple attention \"heads\". The multiheaded attention mechanism is defined as follows:\n\n    $\\operatorname {MultiHead} (Q,K,V)=\\operatorname {Concat} (h_{1},\\ldots ,h_{n})W_{O}$\n\nwhere h_i is the output of the i-th attention head, n is the number of attention heads, and W_O is a weight matrix.\n\nEach attention head computes its own attention scores and produces its own output vector. The outputs of all the attention heads are concatenated together and transformed using the weight matrix W_O to produce the final output of the multiheaded attention mechanism.\n\nThe multiheaded attention mechanism allows the model to attend to different portions of the input data using multiple attention heads, each of which focuses on a different aspect of the data. By using multiple attention heads, the model can learn to attend to different portions of the input data simultaneously, enabling it to attend to multiple aspects of the data at once.\n\n Masked attention\n\nThe attention mechanism used in the transformer architecture is a form of masked attention, which is used to prevent the model from attending to future tokens when generating output. The masked attention mechanism is defined as follows:\n\n    $M(i,j)={\\begin{cases}0,&{\\text{if }}j<i\\\\-\\infty ,&{\\text{otherwise}}\\end{cases}}$\n\nwhere M(i,j) is the mask applied to the attention scores for the i-th query and j-th key.\n\nWhen computing the attention scores, the masked attention mechanism sets the attention scores for all future tokens to negative infinity, effectively preventing the model from attending to those tokens. This ensures that the model attends to the input tokens in the correct order, and prevents it from using information about future tokens when generating output.\n\nThe masked attention mechanism is used in the transformer architecture to ensure that the model generates output tokens in the correct order. By preventing the model from attending to future tokens, the masked attention mechanism ensures that the model generates output tokens that are consistent with the input tokens.\n\n Encoder\n\nThe encoder of the transformer architecture is responsible for encoding the input sequence into a sequence of context vectors, one for each token in the input sequence. The encoder consists of a stack of identical layers, each of which consists of a multi-headed self-attention mechanism followed by a feed-forward neural network.\n\nThe multi-headed self-attention mechanism is used to compute a weighted sum of the input vectors, where the weights are determined by the attention scores computed by the mechanism. The feed-forward neural network is a fully connected neural network that transforms the output of the self-attention mechanism.\n\nThe encoder is initialized with an embedding layer, which maps each token in the input sequence to a dense vector of dimensionality d_model. The embedding layer is followed by a normalization layer, which normalizes the input vectors to have a mean of zero and a variance of one.\n\nThe encoder is trained using the masked autoencoder objective, which is a form of unsupervised learning. The masked autoencoder objective is defined as follows:\n\n    $\\ell =\\| x-\\hat {x}\\| _{2}^{2}$\n\nwhere x is the input sequence and $\\hat {x}$ is the reconstructed sequence produced by the encoder-decoder model.\n\nDuring training, the encoder is trained to reconstruct the input sequence using the decoder, while the decoder is trained to reconstruct the input sequence using the encoder. This allows the model to learn a compressed representation of the input sequence that captures the most important features of the sequence.\n\n Decoder\n\nThe decoder of the transformer architecture is responsible for generating an output sequence of tokens, conditioned on the context vectors produced by the encoder. The decoder consists of a stack of identical layers, each of which consists of a multi-headed self-attention mechanism followed by a feed-forward neural network.\n\nThe multi-headed self-attention mechanism is used to compute a weighted sum of the input vectors, where the weights are determined by the attention scores computed by the mechanism. The feed-forward neural network is a fully connected neural network that transforms the output of the self-attention mechanism.\n\nThe decoder is initialized with a start token, which is used as the first input token for the decoder. The decoder is then trained to generate the rest of the output sequence using the encoder context vectors and the previous output tokens as input.\n\nThe decoder is trained using the cross-entropy loss, which measures the difference between the predicted output tokens and the true output tokens. The cross-entropy loss is defined as follows:\n\n    $H(p,q)=-\\sum _{i}p_{i}\\log q_{i}$\n\nwhere p is the true output distribution and q is the predicted output distribution.\n\nDuring training, the decoder is trained to generate the output sequence using the encoder context vectors and the previous output tokens as input. The encoder context vectors provide the decoder with information about the input sequence, while the previous output tokens provide the decoder with information about the context in which the current token is being generated.\n\n Adapted architectures\n\nSome models only use the encoder or decoder part of the transformer architecture. Early GPT models were decoder-only, while BERT is an encoder-only model.\n\n Full transformer architecture\n\nThe full transformer architecture is a deep-learning architecture that is composed of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder is responsible for encoding the input sequence, while the decoder is responsible for generating the output sequence.\n\nThe encoder consists of a stack of identical layers, each of which consists of a multi-headed self-attention mechanism followed by a feed-forward neural network. The decoder also consists of a stack of identical layers, but the architecture is slightly different from that of the encoder. The decoder begins with a start-of-sequence token, which is fed into the first layer of the decoder. Each subsequent layer in the decoder computes a weighted sum of the context vectors produced by the encoder, where the weights are determined by the attention scores computed by the mechanism. The decoder also uses a second type of attention mechanism, called cross-attention, which allows the decoder to attend to the output sequence that has been generated so far. This enables the decoder to generate a sequence of tokens that is consistent with the input sequence.\n\nThe output of the last layer of the decoder is passed through a softmax layer, which produces a probability distribution over the possible output tokens. The token with the highest probability is then selected as the next token in the output sequence, and is fed back into the decoder as input for the next step.\n\nThe transformer architecture is a powerful deep-learning architecture that has achieved state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and question answering. Its ability to learn long-range dependencies in sequences has made it particularly useful for natural language processing tasks.\n\n Sublayers\n\nEach layer of the transformer architecture consists of two sublayers: a multi-headed self-attention sublayer and a feed-forward sublayer. The multi-headed self-attention sublayer is used to attend to different portions of the input sequence, while the feed-forward sublayer is used to transform the output of the self-attention sublayer.\n\nThe multi-headed self-attention sublayer is a variant of the attention mechanism that allows the model to attend to different portions of the input sequence using multiple attention \"heads\". Each attention head computes its own attention scores and produces its own output vector. The outputs of all the attention heads are concatenated together and transformed using a weight matrix to produce the final output of the multi-headed self-attention sublayer.\n\nThe feed-forward sublayer is a fully connected neural network with two hidden layers, followed by a rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function. The ReLU activation function is used to introduce non-linearity into the network, allowing it to learn complex patterns in the data. The input to the feed-forward sublayer is the output of the self-attention sublayer, and the output of the feed-forward sublayer is added to the output of the self-attention sublayer to produce the final output of the layer.\n\nThe transformer architecture is a powerful deep-learning architecture that has achieved state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and question answering. Its ability to learn long-range dependencies in sequences has made it particularly useful for natural language processing tasks.\n\n Pseudocode\n\nThe following pseudocode shows how the transformer architecture can be implemented in a programming language such as Python. The code defines a Transformer class that implements the transformer architecture, and includes methods for initializing the model, training the model, and generating output sequences using the model.\n\nThe Transformer class has several attributes, including the number of layers in the encoder and decoder, the dimensionality of the input vectors, the number of attention heads in the multi-headed attention mechanism, the feed-forward network, the normalization layers, and the dropout rate.\n\nThe forward method of the Transformer class implements the forward pass of the transformer architecture. It takes as input the input sequence x and the target sequence y, and returns the loss of the model on the input-output pair. The method first embeds the input and target sequences using the embedding layers, adds positional encodings to the embedded sequences, and passes them through the encoder and decoder respectively. The output of the decoder is then passed through a softmax layer to produce the predicted output sequence, which is compared to the true output sequence using the cross-entropy loss to compute the loss of the model.\n\nThe train method of the Transformer class trains the transformer model on a dataset of input-output pairs. It first initializes the model parameters using the Xavier initialization method, and then enters a training loop that iterates over the dataset for a fixed number of epochs. In each epoch, the model is trained on each input-output pair in the dataset using stochastic gradient descent with backpropagation to update the model parameters. The loss of the model on the training set is printed at regular intervals during training.\n\nThe decode method of the Transformer class generates an output sequence for a given input sequence using the trained transformer model. It first embeds the input sequence and adds positional encodings to the embedded sequence, and then passes it through the encoder to produce a sequence of context vectors. The method then enters a decoding loop that generates the output sequence token by token. In each iteration of the loop, the method generates a probability distribution over the possible output tokens using the decoder and the context vectors produced by the encoder, and selects the token with the highest probability as the next token in the output sequence. The selected token is then appended to the output sequence and used as input for the next iteration of the loop.\n\nThis pseudocode provides a basic implementation of the transformer architecture, but there are many ways to modify and extend the architecture to suit different tasks and requirements.\n\n Terminology\n\nThere are many variations of the transformer architecture, and the terminology used to describe the different components of the architecture can be confusing. Here we provide a glossary of some of the most common terms used to describe the transformer architecture.\n\n* Encoder: A component of the transformer architecture that is responsible for encoding the input sequence into a sequence of context vectors, one for each token in the input sequence.\n* Decoder: A component of the transformer architecture that is responsible for generating an output sequence of tokens, conditioned on the context vectors produced by the encoder.\n* Multi-headed attention: A variant of the attention mechanism that allows the model to attend to different portions of the input sequence using multiple attention \"heads\". Each attention head computes its own attention scores and produces its own output vector. The outputs of all the attention heads are concatenated together and transformed using a weight matrix to produce the final output of the multi-headed attention mechanism.\n* Feed-forward network: A sub-component of the transformer architecture that is responsible for processing the output of the self-attention mechanism. It consists of a fully connected neural network with two hidden layers, followed by a rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function.\n* Normalization: A technique used in the transformer architecture to normalize the input vectors to have a mean of zero and a variance of one. This helps to stabilize the training process and improve the convergence of the model.\n* Dropout: A regularization technique used in the transformer architecture to prevent overfitting. Dropout randomly sets a fraction of the input units to zero during training, which forces the model to learn a more robust representation of the data.\n* Positional encoding: A technique used in the transformer architecture to provide information about the position of each token in the input sequence. Positional encoding is added to the input embeddings before they are fed into the self-attention mechanism.\n\n Subsequent work\n\nSince the original transformer paper, many variants of the transformer architecture have been proposed. Some of the most notable variants include BERT, GPT, and T5. These models have achieved state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of tasks, including natural language understanding, question answering, and text generation.\n\n Alternative activation functions\n\nThe feedforward network in the transformer architecture uses the ReLU activation function. However, other activation functions can be used instead. For example, the Llama series of models uses the SwiGLU activation function, which is a gated linear unit with a sigmoid activation function instead of a ReLU activation function. The GELU activation function is also commonly used in transformer architectures.\n\n Alternative normalizations\n\nThe transformer architecture uses layer normalization. However, other normalization techniques can be used instead. For example, the Llama series of models uses RMS normalization.\n\n Alternative positional encodings\n\nThe transformer architecture uses sinusoidal positional encoding. However, other positional encodings can be used instead. For example, the original GPT model uses learned positional embeddings, while the BERT model uses absolute positional embeddings.\n\n RoPE\n\nRotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) is a technique used in the transformer architecture to encode the position of each token in the input sequence. RoPE uses rotary embeddings to rotate the input embeddings, which provides information about the position of each token in the sequence.\n\nThe rotary embedding for a position k is defined as follows:\n\n    $R(k)={\\begin{bmatrix}\\cos(kr);\\\\\\sin(kr)\\end{bmatrix}}$\n\nwhere r is the frequency of the embedding and k is the position.\n\nThe input embeddings x are rotated using the rotary embeddings R(k) as follows:\n\n    $x_{rotated}=R(k)\\otimes x$\n\nwhere \u2297 denotes the Hadamard product.\n\nThe rotated embeddings are then passed through the self-attention mechanism.\n\nThe advantage of RoPE is that it allows the model to attend to a larger number of positions than would be possible with fixed positional embeddings. This is because the rotary embeddings can be used to encode the position of each token in the sequence, regardless of the length of the sequence.\n\nRoPE is used in the Llama series of models, as well as in other models such as GPT-3 and BERT.\n\n ALiBi\n\nAttention with Linear Biases (ALiBi) is a positional encoding scheme for the transformer architecture. It is a simple and efficient alternative to the traditional sinusoidal positional encoding, and has the advantage of being able to scale to an arbitrary length of sequence.\n\nThe ALiBi attention mechanism is defined as follows:\n\n    $\\operatorname {Attention} (Q,K,V)={\\text{softmax}}\\left(QK^{T}+B\\right)V$\n\nwhere B is a bias matrix that decreases linearly with the distance between the query and key positions.\n\nThe bias matrix B is defined as follows:\n\n    $B(i,j)=-\\alpha \\cdot |i-j|$\n\nwhere \u03b1 is a learnable parameter that controls the slope of the linear decrease in the bias.\n\nThe ALiBi attention mechanism is a simple and efficient alternative to the traditional sinusoidal positional encoding, and has the advantage of being able to scale to an arbitrary length of sequence.\n\nRelative Position Encodings\n\nRelative position encodings are a type of positional encoding used in the transformer architecture. Unlike the traditional sinusoidal positional encoding, which encodes the absolute position of each token in the sequence, relative position encodings encode the relative position between tokens in the sequence.\n\nThe advantage of relative position encodings is that they allow the model to attend to a larger number of positions than would be possible with fixed positional embeddings. This is because the relative position encodings can be used to encode the position of each token in the sequence, regardless of the length of the sequence.\n\nRelative position encodings are used in the T5 model, as well as in other models such as GPT-3 and BERT.\n\n Efficient implementation\n\nThe transformer model is a deep-learning architecture that is widely used in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. While the transformer model has achieved state-of-the-art performance on a variety of NLP tasks, it can be computationally expensive to train and infer, especially for long sequences.\n\nOne way to improve the efficiency of the transformer model is to use optimized libraries such as NVIDIA's Triton, which can automatically generate optimized kernels for the attention and feed-forward operations.\n\nAnother way to improve the efficiency of the transformer model is to use techniques such as group normalization and flash attention, which can reduce the computational complexity of the attention mechanism.\n\nFinally, it is also possible to use techniques such as quantization and knowledge distillation to reduce the size of the transformer model and make it more efficient to train and infer.\n\n KV caching\n\nIn the transformer architecture, the attention mechanism is used to weigh the importance of different portions of the input sequence when processing it. This allows the model to attend to different portions of the input sequence when generating output.\n\nIn addition to attending to different portions of the input sequence, the attention mechanism can also attend to previously generated tokens. This is done using key-value (KV) caching, which stores the keys and values from the previous step of the sequence and uses them as input to the attention mechanism in the current step.\n\nKV caching allows the model to attend to previously generated tokens, which can be useful for tasks such as text generation, where the model needs to generate a sequence of tokens that are consistent with the previous tokens in the sequence.\n\nFlashAttention is an optimized implementation of the attention mechanism that is designed to be fast and memory-efficient. It uses a technique called \"kernel fusion\" to fuse the computation of the attention scores and the attention output into a single kernel, which reduces the number of memory accesses required by the attention mechanism.\n\nFlashAttention has been shown to be significantly faster than the standard attention mechanism implemented in PyTorch, while achieving similar or better accuracy on a variety of tasks.\n\n Multi-Query Attention\n\nMulti-query attention is a variant of the attention mechanism that uses a single attention head to attend to all of the input tokens. This reduces the number of parameters in the attention mechanism and can improve the efficiency of the model.\n\nMulti-query attention has been shown to be effective for tasks such as image classification and machine translation. It has also been combined with other techniques, such as group normalization and flash attention, to further improve the efficiency and performance of the model.\n\n Speculative decoding\n\nSpeculative decoding is a technique for accelerating the decoding of sequences using the transformer architecture. The idea is to decode multiple tokens ahead of their turn in the sequence, and then verify the decoded tokens before proceeding.\n\nTo implement speculative decoding, a small model is used to generate speculative tokens for each position in the sequence. The speculative tokens are then verified by checking whether they satisfy certain constraints, such as being valid words in a language model.\n\nIf a speculative token is verified, it is kept and used to generate the next token in the sequence. If a speculative token is not verified, it is discarded and the next token in the sequence is generated using a different speculative token.\n\nSpeculative decoding can be used to accelerate the decoding of sequences using the transformer architecture, as it allows multiple tokens to be decoded in parallel. However, it requires additional computation to verify the speculative tokens, so the overall speedup achieved by speculative decoding depends on the balance between the parallelism gained by decoding multiple tokens ahead of their turn and the additional computation required to verify the speculative tokens.\n\n Sub-quadratic transformers\n\nTraining transformer-based models on long sequences can be computationally expensive, as the quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism scales with the length of the sequence. To address this issue, several approaches have been proposed to reduce the computational complexity of the attention mechanism.\n\nOne approach is to use attention mechanisms that have sub-quadratic complexity with respect to the length of the sequence. For example, the linear attention mechanism has a complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the sequence. Other approaches include using hierarchical attention mechanisms, which divide the sequence into smaller chunks and compute attention within each chunk, or using attention mechanisms that rely on fixed-length context vectors, such as the transformer-XL model.\n\nAnother approach is to use techniques such as kv-caching or peephole decoding to reduce the amount of computation required for each token in the sequence. These techniques allow the model to reuse computations across tokens, reducing the overall computational burden.\n\nThese approaches can significantly reduce the computational complexity of training transformer-based models on long sequences, making it feasible to train models on larger datasets or to use longer contexts in downstream tasks.\n\n Alternative attention graphs\n\nThe transformer architecture uses the attention mechanism to weigh the importance of different portions of the input sequence when processing it. This allows the model to attend to different portions of the input sequence when generating output.\n\nThere are several variants of the attention mechanism that have been proposed. One such variant is the Reformer, which uses locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) to reduce the computational complexity of the attention mechanism. Another variant is the Longformer, which uses a combination of local and global attention to attend to both nearby and distant portions of the input sequence.\n\nOther variants of the attention mechanism include the Shifted-Window Attention, which divides the input sequence into overlapping windows and computes attention within each window, and the Blockwise Attention, which computes attention within fixed-length blocks of the input sequence.\n\nThese variants of the attention mechanism can be used to improve the efficiency or effectiveness of the transformer architecture for specific tasks or datasets.\n\n Random Feature Attention\n\nRandom Feature Attention (RFA) is a method for approximating the attention mechanism in the transformer architecture using random features. The idea is to use a set of random features to approximate the attention scores, and then use these scores to compute a weighted sum of the input vectors.\n\nRFA has been shown to be effective for tasks such as image classification and machine translation. It has also been combined with other techniques, such as group normalization and flash attention, to further improve the efficiency and performance of the model.\n\nRandom Feature Attention is a simple and efficient alternative to the traditional attention mechanism, and has the advantage of being able to scale to an arbitrary length of sequence.\n\n Multimodality\n\nThe transformer architecture can be extended to handle multiple modalities of data, such as text, images, and audio. This is done by using a separate encoder for each modality, and then concatenating the outputs of the encoders before passing them through a joint decoder.\n\nFor example, the LLaVA model uses a text encoder based on the BERT architecture and an image encoder based on the CLIP architecture. The outputs of the two encoders are concatenated and passed through a joint decoder that generates a text output.\n\nThe ability to handle multiple modalities of data makes the transformer architecture a powerful tool for multimodal tasks such as image captioning, visual question answering, and speech recognition.\n\n Applications\n\nThe transformer architecture has been successfully applied to a wide range of tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, question answering, and image captioning. The architecture has also been used to improve the performance of speech recognition systems and recommendation systems.\n\nOne of the most successful applications of the transformer architecture is in the field of natural language processing (NLP). The transformer architecture has been used to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a variety of NLP tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and question answering.\n\nThe transformer architecture has also been used to improve the performance of computer vision tasks such as image classification and object detection. For example, the ViT (Vision Transformer) model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ImageNet classification task using a purely transformer-based architecture.\n\nThe transformer architecture has also been used to improve the performance of speech recognition systems. The Wav2Vec model, which is based on the transformer architecture, has been shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the LibriSpeech speech recognition task.\n\nThe transformer architecture has also been used to improve the performance of recommendation systems. The NeuREC model, which is based on the transformer architecture, has been shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance on several recommendation tasks.\n\nSee also\n\n* List of machine learning algorithms\n* List of natural language processing algorithms\n* Machine learning\n* Neural network\n* Natural language processing\n\nNotes\n\n* \u2191 Vaswani et al. mention using dropout with a rate of p=0.1 as one of their \"key training procedures\", but do not report the exact value of p in the experiments.\n* \u2191 \"Positional encoding\" in this context refers to the positional encoding scheme described in the original paper by Vaswani et al.; see the \"Sinusoidal positional encoding\" subsection above.\n* \u2191 The positional encoding scheme described in the original paper by Vaswani et al. assumes that the maximum sequence length is known beforehand and encoded into the positional embedding matrix. When the input sequence exceeds this maximum length, the excess elements are simply ignored. Several solutions have been proposed to address this limitation, including truncating the positional embedding matrix or dynamically extending it to accommodate longer sequences.\n* \u2191 The original paper by Vaswani et al. describes a linear position-wise feedforward network, whose inner feedforward layer has the same width as the model (d_model). However, it is common to use a wider feedforward layer, e.g. 4d_model.\n* \u2191 In the original paper by Vaswani et al., the feedforward layers do not have a ReLU activation function after the first linear layer. Instead, the ReLU is applied to the entire output of the feedforward layer.\n* \u2191 The original paper by Vaswani et al. does not specify the exact type of normalization used in the model.
