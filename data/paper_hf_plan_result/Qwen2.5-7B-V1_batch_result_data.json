Between any two specific actions, we may reason in language in order to track progress (\u201cnow that everything is cut, I should heat up the pot of water\u2019\u2019), to handle exceptions or adjust the plan according to the situation (\u201cI don\u2019t have salt, so let me use soy sauce and pepper instead\u2019\u2019), and to realize when external information is needed (\u201chow do I prepare dough? Let me search on the Internet\u2019\u2019). \nWe may also act (open a cookbook to read the recipe, open the fridge, check ingredients) to support the reasoning and to answer questions (\u201cWhat dish can I make right now?\u201d).\nThis tight synergy between \u201cacting'\u2019 and \u201creasoning'\u2019 allows humans to learn new tasks quickly and perform robust decision making or reasoning, even under previously unseen circumstances or facing information uncertainties.\n\n\n\nRecent results have hinted at the possibility of combining verbal reasoning with interactive decision making in autonomous systems. \nOn one hand, properly prompted large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated emergent capabilities to carry out several steps of reasoning traces to derive answers from questions in arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning tasks\u00a0<cit.>.  However, this \u201cchain-of-thought\u2019' reasoning is a static black box, in that the model uses its own internal representations to generate thoughts and is not grounded in the external world,\nwhich limits its ability to reason reactively or update its knowledge. This can lead to issues like fact hallucination and error propagation over the reasoning process (Figure\u00a0<ref> (1b)). \nOn the other hand, recent work has explored the use of pre-trained language models for planning and acting in interactive environments\u00a0<cit.>, with a focus  on predicting actions via language priors. These approaches usually convert multi-modal observations into text, use a language model to generate domain-specific actions or plans, and then use a controller to choose or execute them. \nHowever, they do not employ language models to reason abstractly about high-level goals or maintain a working memory to support acting, barring\u00a0<cit.> who perform a limited form of verbal reasoning to reiterate spatial facts about the current state.\nBeyond such simple embodied tasks to interact with a few blocks, there have not been studies on how reasoning and acting can be combined in a synergistic manner for general task solving, and if such a combination can bring systematic benefits compared to reasoning or acting alone.\n\n\nIn this work, we present , a general paradigm to combine reasoning and acting with language models for solving diverse language reasoning and decision making tasks (Figure\u00a0<ref>). \n prompts LLMs to generate both verbal reasoning traces and actions pertaining to a task in an interleaved manner, which allows the model to perform dynamic reasoning to create, maintain, and adjust high-level plans for acting (reason to act), while also interact with the external environments (e.g. Wikipedia) to incorporate additional information into reasoning (act to reason).\n\nWe conduct empirical evaluations of  and state-of-the-art baselines on four diverse benchmarks: question answering (HotPotQA, ), fact verification (Fever, ), text-based game (ALFWorld, ), and webpage navigation (WebShop, ). \nFor HotPotQA and Fever, with access to a Wikipedia API that the model can interact with,  outperforms vanilla action generation models while being competitive with chain-of-thought reasoning ()\u00a0<cit.>. The best approach overall is a combination of  and  that allows for the use of both internal knowledge and externally obtained information during reasoning.\nOn ALFWorld and WebShop, two or even one-shot  prompting is able to outperform imitation or reinforcement learning methods trained with 10^3 \u223c 10^5 task instances, with an absolute improvement of 34% and 10% in success rates respectively. We also demonstrate the importance of sparse, versatile reasoning in decision making by showing consistent advantages over controlled baselines with actions only. \nBesides general applicability and performance boost, the combination of reasoning and acting also contributes to model interpretability, trustworthiness, and diagnosability across all domains, as humans can readily distinguish information from model's internal knowledge versus external environments, as well as inspect reasoning traces to understand the decision basis of model actions. \n\n\nTo summarize, our key contributions are the following: \n(1) we introduce , a novel prompt-based paradigm to synergize reasoning and acting in language models for general task solving; \n(2) we perform extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks to showcase the advantage of  in a few-shot learning setup over prior approaches that perform either reasoning or action generation in isolation;\n(3) we present systematic ablations and analysis to understand the importance of acting in reasoning tasks, and reasoning in interactive tasks; \n(4) we analyze the limitations of  under the prompting setup (i.e. limited support of reasoning and acting behaviors), and perform initial finetuning experiments showing the potential of  to improve with additional training data. \nScaling up  to train and operate on more tasks and combining it with complementary paradigms like reinforcement learning could further unlock the potential of large language models.Consider a general setup of an agent interacting with an environment for task solving. At time step t, an agent receives an observation o_t \u2208\ud835\udcaa from the environment and takes an action a_t \u2208\ud835\udc9c following some policy \u03c0(a_t | c_t), where c_t = (o_1, a_1, \u22ef, o_t-1, a_t-1, o_t) is the context to the agent. Learning a policy is challenging when the mapping c_t \u21a6 a_t is highly implicit and requires extensive computation. \nFor example, the agent shown in Figure\u00a0<ref>(1c) is unable to generate the correct final action (Act 4) to finish the QA task as it requires complex reasoning over the trajectory context (Question, Act 1-3, Obs 1-3).\nSimilarly, the agent shown in Figure\u00a0<ref>(2a) fails to comprehend from the context that sinkbasin 1 does not contain peppershaker 1, thus keep producing hallucinating actions.\n\n\nThe idea of  is simple: we augment the agent's action space to \u00c2 = \ud835\udc9c\u222a\u2112, where \u2112 is the space of language. An action \u00e2_t \u2208\u2112 in the language space, which we will refer to as a thought or a reasoning trace, does not affect the external environment, thus leading to no observation feedback. Instead, a thought \u00e2_t aims to compose useful information by reasoning over the current context c_t, and update the context c_t+1 = (c_t, \u00e2_t) to support future reasoning or acting. \nAs shown in Figure\u00a0<ref>, there could be various types of useful thoughts, e.g. decomposing task goals and create action plans (2b, Act 1; 1d, Thought 1), injecting commonsense knowledge relevant to task solving (2b, Act 1), extracting important parts from observations (1d, Thought2, 4), track progress and transit action plans (2b, Act 8), handle exceptions and adjust action plans (1d, Thought 3), and so on. \n\n\nHowever, as the language space \u2112 is unlimited, learning in this augmented action space is difficult and requires strong language priors. In this paper, we mainly focus on \nthe setup where a frozen large language model, PaLM-540B\u00a0<cit.>[We show some GPT-3\u00a0<cit.> results in Appendix\u00a0<ref>, which outperforms PaLM-540B. ], is prompted with few-shot in-context examples to generate both domain-specific actions and free-form language thoughts for task solving (Figure\u00a0<ref> (1d), (2b)). Each in-context example is a human trajectory of actions, thoughts, and environment observations to solve a task instance (see Appendix\u00a0<ref>). \nFor the tasks where reasoning is of primary importance (Figure\u00a0<ref>(1)), we alternate the generation of thoughts and actions so that the task-solving trajectory consists of multiple thought-action-observation steps.\nIn contrast, for  decision making tasks that potentially involve a large number of actions (Figure\u00a0<ref>(2)), thoughts only need to appear sparsely in the most relevant positions of a trajectory, so we let the language model decide the asynchronous occurrence of thoughts and actions for itself.\n\nSince decision making and reasoning capabilities are integrated into a large language model,  enjoys several unique features:\n    A) Intuitive and easy to design: Designing  prompts is straightforward as human annotators just type down their thoughts in language on top of their actions taken. No ad-hoc format choice, thought design, or example selection is used in this paper. We detail prompt design for each task in Sections\u00a0<ref> and <ref>.\n    B) General and flexible: Due to the flexible thought space and thought-action occurrence format,  works for diverse tasks with distinct action spaces and reasoning needs, including but not limited to QA, fact verification, text game, and web navigation.\n    C) Performant and robust:  shows strong generalization to new task instances while learning solely from one to six in-context examples, consistently outperforming baselines with only reasoning or acting across different domains. We also show in Section\u00a0<ref> additional benefits when finetuning is enabled, and in Section\u00a0<ref> how  performance is robust to prompt selections.\n    D) Human aligned and controllable:  promises an interpretable sequential decision making and reasoning process where humans can easily inspect reasoning and factual correctness. Moreover, humans can also control or correct the agent behavior on the go by thought editing, as shown in Figure\u00a0<ref> in Section\u00a0<ref>.We begin with knowledge-intensive reasoning tasks like multi-hop question answering and fact verification.\nAs shown in Figure\u00a0<ref>(1d), by interacting with a Wikipedia API,  is able to retrieve information to support reasoning, while also use reasoning to target what to retrieve next, demonstrating a synergy of reasoning and acting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Setup\n\n\n\n\nDomains We consider two datasets challenging knowledge retrieval and reasoning: (1) HotPotQA\u00a0<cit.>, a multi-hop question answering benchmark that requires reasoning over two or more Wikipedia passages, and\n(2) FEVER\u00a0<cit.>, a fact verification benchmark where each claim is annotated SUPPORTS, REFUTES, or NOT ENOUGH INFO, based on if there exists a Wikipedia passage to verify the claim.\nIn this work, we operate in a question-only setup for both tasks, where models only receive the question/claim as input without access to support paragraphs, and have to rely on their internal knowledge or retrieve knowledge via interacting with an external environment to support reasoning.\n\nAction Space We design a simple Wikipedia web API with three types of actions to support interactive information retrieval: \n(1) [], which returns the first 5 sentences from the corresponding  wiki page if it exists, or else suggests top-5 similar entities from the Wikipedia search engine, \n(2) [], which would return the next sentence in the page containing , simulating Ctrl+F functionality on the browser. \n(3) [], which would finish the current task with .\nWe note that this action space mostly can only retrieve a small part of a passage based on exact passage name, which is significantly weaker than state-of-the-art lexical or neural retrievers. The purpose is to simulate how humans would interact with Wikipedia, and force models to retrieve via explicit reasoning in language.\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Methods\n\n\n Prompting For HotpotQA and Fever, we randomly select 6 and 3 cases[We find more examples do not improve performance.] from the training set and manually compose -format trajectories to use as few-shot exemplars in the prompts. Similar to Figure\u00a0<ref>(d), each trajectory consists of multiple thought-action-observation steps (i.e. dense thought), where free-form thoughts are used for various purposes.  Specifically, we use a combination of thoughts that decompose questions (\u201cI need to search x, find y, then find z\u201d), extract information from Wikipedia observations (\u201cx was started in 1844\u201d, \u201cThe paragraph does not tell x\u201d), perform commonsense (\u201cx is not y, so z must instead be...\u201d) or arithmetic reasoning (\u201c1844 < 1989\u201d), guide search reformulation (\u201cmaybe I can search/look up x instead\u201d), and synthesize the final answer (\u201c...so the answer is x\u201d). See Appendix\u00a0<ref> for more details.\n\nBaselines We systematically ablate   trajectories to build prompts for multiple baselines (with formats as Figure\u00a0<ref>(1a-1c)): \n(a) Standard prompting (), which removes all thoughts, actions, observations in  trajectories. \n(b) Chain-of-thought prompting ()\u00a0<cit.>, which removes actions and observations and serve as a reasoning-only baseline. We also build a self-consistency baseline ()\u00a0<cit.> by sampling 21  trajectories with decoding temperature 0.7 during inference and adopting the majority answer, which is found to consistently boost performance over . \n(c) Acting-only prompt (), which removes thoughts in  trajectories, loosely resembling how WebGPT\u00a0<cit.> interacts with the Internet to answer questions, though it operates on a different task and action space, and uses imitation and reinforcement learning instead of prompting.\n\nCombining Internal and External Knowledge As will be detail in Section\u00a0<ref>, we observe that the problem solving process demonstrated by  is more factual and grounded, whereas  is more accurate in formulating reasoning structure but can easily suffer from hallucinated facts or thoughts. We therefore propose to incorporate   and , and let the model decide when to switch to the other method based on the following heuristics:\n    A) \n     \u2192 : when  fails to return an answer within given steps, back off to . We set 7 and 5 steps for HotpotQA and FEVER respectively as we find more steps will not improve  performance[Of all trajectories with correct final answers, those with 7 steps on HotpotQA and 5 steps on FEVER only take up 0.84% and 1.33% respectively.]. \n    B) \n       \u2192  : when the majority answer among n  samples occurs less than n/2 times (i.e. internal knowledge might not support the task confidently), back off to . \n\n\nFinetuning Due to the challenge of manually annotating reasoning traces and actions at scale, we consider a bootstraping approach similar to <cit.>, using 3,000 trajectories with correct answers generated by  (also for other baselines) to finetune smaller language models (PaLM-8/62B) to decode trajectories (all thoughts, actions, observations) conditioned on input questions/claims. More details are in Appendix\u00a0<ref>.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Results and Observations\n \n\n\n outperforms  consistently Table\u00a0<ref> shows HotpotQA and Fever results using PaLM-540B as the base model with different prompting methods. \nWe note that  is better than  on both tasks, demonstrating the value of reasoning to guide acting, especially for synthesizing the final answer, as shown in Figure\u00a0<ref> (1c-d). Fine-tuning results\u00a0<ref> also confirm the benefit of reasoning traces for more informed acting.\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        \n\n\n vs.  \nOn the other hand,  outperforms  on Fever (60.9 vs. 56.3) and slightly lags behind  on HotpotQA (27.4 vs. 29.4). \nFever claims for SUPPORTS/REFUTES might only differ by a slight amount (see Appendix\u00a0<ref>), so acting to retrieve accurate and up-to-date knowledge is vital. \nTo better understand the behavioral difference between  and  on HotpotQA, we randomly sampled 50 trajectories with correct and incorrect answers (judged by EM) from  and  respectively (thus 200 examples in total), and manually labeled their success and failure modes in Table\u00a0<ref>. \nSome key observations are as follows:\n\n  A) Hallucination is a serious problem for , resulting in much higher false positive rate than  (14% vs. 6%) in success mode, and make up its major failure mode (56%).\nIn contrast, the problem solving trajectory of is more grounded, fact-driven, and trustworthy, thanks to the access of an external knowledge base.\n\n  B) While interleaving reasoning, action and observation steps improves 's groundedness and trustworthiness, such a structural constraint also reduces its flexibility in formulating reasoning steps, leading to more reasoning error rate than . \nwe note that there is one frequent error pattern specific to , in which the model repetitively generates the previous thoughts and actions, and we categorize it as part of \u201creasoning error\u201d as the model fails to reason about what the proper next action to take and jump out of the loop[We suspect that this could be due to the sub-optimal greedy decoding procedure, and future work using better decoding (e.g. beam search) might help address this issue.]. \n\n  C) For , successfully retrieving informative knowledge via search is critical. Non-informative search, which counts for 23% of the error cases, derails the model reasoning and gives it a hard time to recover and reformulate thoughts. This is perhaps an expected trade-off between factuality and flexibility, which motivates our proposed strategies of combining two methods.\n\n\nWe provide examples for each success and failure modes in Appendix <ref>. We also find some HotpotQA questions may contain outdated answer labels, see Figure\u00a0<ref> for example.\n\n + -SC perform best for prompting LLMs Also shown in Table\u00a0<ref>, the best prompting method on HotpotQA and Fever are  \u2192  and   \u2192   respectively. Furthermore, Figure\u00a0<ref> shows how different methods perform with respect to the number of  samples used. While two  +  methods are advantageous at one task each, they both significantly and consistently outperform  across different number of samples, reaching  performance with 21 samples using merely 3-5 samples. These results indicate the value of properly combining model internal knowledge and external knowledge for reasoning tasks. \n\n\n performs best for fine-tuning Figure\u00a0<ref> shows the scaling effect of prompting/finetuning four methods (, , , ) on HotpotQA. With PaLM-8/62B, prompting  performs worst among four methods due to the difficulty to learn both reasoning and acting from in-context examples. However, when finetuned with just 3,000 examples,  becomes the best method among the four, with PaLM-8B finetuned  outperforming all PaLM-62B prompting methods, and PaLM-62B finetuned  outperforming all 540B prompting methods. In contrast, finetuning  or  is significantly worse than finetuning  or  for both PaLM-8/62B, as the former essentially teaches models to memorize (potentially halluincated) knowledge facts, and the latter teaches models how to (reason and) act to access information from Wikipedia, a more generalizable skill for knowledge reasoning. \nAs all prompting methods are still significantly far from domain-specific state-of-the-art approaches (Table\u00a0<ref>), we believe finetuning with more human-written data might be a better way to unleash the power of .We also test  on two language-based interactive decision-making tasks, ALFWorld and WebShop,\nboth of which feature complex environments that require agents to act over long horizons with sparse rewards, warranting the need for reasoning to act and explore effectively.\n\n\n\nALFWorld\nALFWorld\u00a0<cit.> (Figure\u00a0<ref>(2)) is a synthetic text-based game designed to align with the embodied ALFRED benchmark\u00a0<cit.>. It includes 6 types of tasks in which an agent needs to achieve a high-level goal (e.g. examine paper under desklamp) by navigating and interacting with a simulated household via text actions (e.g. \ngo to coffeetable 1, take paper 2, use desklamp 1).\nA task instance can have more than 50 locations and take an expert policy more than 50 steps to solve, thus challenging an agent to plan and track subgoals, as well as explore systematically (e.g. check all desks one by one for desklamp). In particular, one challenge built into ALFWorld is the need to determine likely locations for common household items (e.g. desklamps will likely be on desks, shelfs, or dressers), making this environment a good fit for LLMs to exploit their pretrained commonsense knowledge.\nTo prompt , we randomly annotate three trajectories from the training set for each task type, where each trajectory includes sparse thoughts that (1) decompose the goal, (2) track subgoal completion, (3) determine the next subgoal, and (4) reason via commonsense where to find an object and what to do with it.\nWe show prompts used for ALFWorld in Appendix\u00a0<ref>.\nFollowing \u00a0<cit.>, we evaluate on 134 unseen evaluation games in a task-specific setup. For robustness, we construct 6 prompts for each task type through each permutation of 2 annotated trajectories from the 3 we annotate.  prompts are constructed using the same trajectories, but without thoughts \u2014 since task instances are randomly chosen from the training set, it favors neither  nor  and provides a fair and controlled comparison to test the importance of sparse thoughts. \nFor baselines, we use BUTLER\u00a0<cit.>, an imitation learning agent trained on 10^5 expert trajectories for each task type[<cit.> finetuned a GPT-2 model on 3553 task instances and achieved a much improved performance than BUTLER, but it is trained on all task types, thus not included as a baseline.]. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWebShop\n\nCan  also interact with noisy real-world language environments for practical applications? \nWe investigate WebShop\u00a0<cit.>, a recently proposed online shopping website environment with 1.18M real-world products and 12k human instructions. Unlike ALFWorld, Webshop contains a high variety of structured and unstructured texts (e.g. product titles, descriptions, and options crawled from Amazon), and requires an agent to purchase a product based on a user instruction (e.g. \u201cI am looking for a nightstand\nwith drawers. It should have a nickel finish, and priced lower than $140\u201d) through web interactions (e.g. search \u201cnightstand drawers\u201d, choose buttons such as \u201ccolor: modern-nickel-white\u201d or \u201cback to search\u201d). \nThis task is evaluated by average score (percentage of desired attributes covered by the chosen product averaged across all episodes) and success rate (percentage of episodes where the chosen product satisfies all requirements) on 500 test instructions. \nWe formulate  prompts with actions to search, choose product, choose options, and buy, with  prompts additionally reasoning to determine what to explore, when to buy, and what products options are relevant to the instruction.\nSee Table\u00a0<ref> for an example prompt, and Table\u00a0<ref> for model predictions in the Appendix.\nWe compare to an imitation learning (IL) method trained with 1,012 human annotated trajectories, and a imitation + reinforcement learning (IL + RL) method additionally trained with 10,587 training instructions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults\n\n\n outperforms  on both ALFWorld (Table\u00a0<ref>) and Webshop (Table <ref>). On ALFWorld, the best  trial achieves an average success rate of 71%, significantly outperforming the best  (45%) and BUTLER (37%) trials. In fact, even the worse  trial (48%) beats the best trial of both methods. Moreover, the advantage of  over  is consistent across six controlled trials, with relative performance gain ranging from 33% to 90% and averaging 62%. Qualitatively, we saw that, without any thoughts at all,  fails to correctly decompose goals into smaller subgoals, or loses track of the current state of the environment. Example trajectories comparing  and  can be found in Appendix\u00a0<ref> and Appendix\u00a0<ref>. \n\nOn Webshop, one-shot  prompting already performs on par with IL and IL+RL methods. With additional sparse reasoning,  achieves significantly better performance, with an absolute 10% improvement over the  previous best success rate. \nBy checking examples, we find that  is more likely to identify instruction-relevant products and options by reasoning to bridge the gap between noisy observations and actions (e.g. \u201cFor `space-saving ottoman bench for living room', the item has options `39x18x18inch' and `blue' and seems good to buy.\u201d).\nHowever, existing methods are still far from the performance of expert humans (Table\u00a0<ref>), who perform significantly more product explorations and query re-formulations that are still challenging for prompting-based methods.\n\nOn the value of internal reasoning vs. external feedback\n\nTo our knowledge,  is the first demonstration of combined reasoning and action using an LLM applied to an interactive environment within a closed-loop system. Perhaps the closest prior work is Inner Monologue (IM), from <cit.>, in which actions from an embodied agent are motivated by an eponymous \u201cinner monologue\u201d. However, IM's \u201cinner monologue\u201d \nis limited to observations of the environment state and what needs to be completed by the agent for the goal to be satisfied.\nIn contrast, the reasoning traces in  for decision making is flexible and sparse, allowing diverse reasoning types (see Section\u00a0<ref>) to be induced for different tasks.\n\nTo demonstrate the differences between  and IM, and to highlight the importance of internal reasoning vs. simple reactions to external feedback, we ran an ablation experiment using a thought pattern composed of IM-like dense external feedback. As can be seen in Table\u00a0<ref>,  substantially outperforms IM-style prompting () (71 vs. 53 overall success rate), with consistent advantages on five out of six tasks. \nQualitatively, we observed that  often made mistakes in identifying when subgoals were finished, or what the next subgoal should be, due to a lack of high-level goal decomposition. Additionally, many  trajectories struggled to determine where an item would likely be within the ALFWorld environment, due to a lack of commonsense reasoning. Both shortcomings can be addressed in the  paradigm. \nMore details about  is in Appendix\u00a0<ref>. An example prompt for  can be found in Appendix\u00a0<ref>, and an example trajectory in Appendix\u00a0<ref>.Language model for reasoning\nPerhaps the most well-known work of using LLMs for reasoning is Chain-of-Thought (CoT)\u00a0<cit.>, which reveals the ability of LLMs to formulate their own \u201cthinking procedure\u201d for problem solving. Several follow-up works have since been performed, including least-to-most prompting for solving complicated tasks\u00a0<cit.>, zero-shot-CoT\u00a0<cit.>, and reasoning with self-consistency\u00a0<cit.>. Recently, <cit.> systematically studied the formulation and structure of CoT, and observed that the presence of symbols, patterns and texts is crucial to the effectiveness of CoT.\nOther work has also been extended to more sophisticated reasoning architecture beyond simple prompting. For example Selection-Inference\u00a0<cit.> divides the reasoning process into two steps of \u201cselection\u201d and \u201cinference\u201d. STaR\u00a0<cit.> bootstraps the reasoning process by finetuning the model on correct rationales generated by the model itself. Faithful reasoning\u00a0<cit.> decomposes multi-step reasoning into three steps, each performed by a dedicated LM respectively. Similar approaches like Scratchpad\u00a0<cit.>, which finetunes a LM on intermediate computation steps, also demonstrate improvement on multi-step computation problems.\nIn contrast to these methods,  performs more than just isolated, fixed reasoning, and integrates model actions and their corresponding observations into a coherent stream of inputs for the model to reason more accurately and tackle tasks beyond reasoning (e.g. interactive decision making).\n\nLanguage model for decision making\nThe strong capability of LLMs has enabled them to perform tasks beyond language generation, and it is becoming more popular to take advantage of LLMs as a policy model for decision making, especially in interactive environments. WebGPT <cit.> \nuses an LM to interact with web browsers, navigate through web pages, and infer answers to complicated questions from ELI5 <cit.>. In comparison to , WebGPT does not explicitly model the thinking and reasoning procedure, instead rely on expensive human feedback for reinforcement learning.\nIn conversation modeling, chatbots like BlenderBot\u00a0<cit.> and Sparrow\u00a0<cit.> and task-oriented dialogue systems like SimpleTOD\u00a0<cit.> also train LMs to make decision about API calls. Unlike , they do not explicitly consider the reasoning procedure either, and also relies on expensive datasets and human feedback collections for policy learning. In contrast,  learns a policy in a much cheaper way, since the decision making process only requires language description of the reasoning procedure.[Human feedback can also be incorporated in a complementary manner but we leave it for future work.]\n\nLLMS have also been increasingly employed in interactive and embodied environments for planning and decision making. Perhaps most relevant to  in this respect are SayCan\u00a0<cit.> and Inner Monologue\u00a0<cit.>, which use LLMs for robotic action planning and decision making. In SayCan, LLMs were prompted to directly predict possible actions a robot can take, which is then reranked by an affordance model grounded on the visual environments for final prediction. Inner Monologue made further improvements by adding the eponymous \u201cinner monologue\", which is implemented as injected feedback from the environment. To our knowledge, Inner Monologue is the first work that demonstrates such a closed-loop system, which  builds on. However, we argue that Inner Monologue does not truly comprise of inner thoughts \u2014 this is elaborated in Section\u00a0<ref>.\nWe also note that leveraging language as semantically-rich inputs in the process of interactive decision making has been shown to be successful under other settings\u00a0<cit.>. It is becoming more evident that with the help of LLMs, language as a fundamental cognitive mechanism will play a critical role in interaction and decision making. What is more, progress in LLMs has also inspired the development of versatile and generalist agents like <cit.>.We have proposed  \u2013 a simple yet effective method for synergizing reasoning and acting in large language models. Through a diverse set of experiments on multi-hop question-answering, fact checking, and interactive decision-making tasks, we show that  leads to superior performance with interpretable decision traces. Despite the simplicity of our method, complex tasks with large action spaces require more demonstrations to learn well, which unfortunately can easily go beyond the input length limit of in-context learning. We explore the fine-tuning approach on HotpotQA with initial promising results, but learning from more high-quality human annotations will be the desiderata to further improve the performance. Scaling up  with multi-task training and combining it with complementary paradigms like reinforcement learning could result in stronger agents that further unlock the potential of LLMs for more applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Acknowledgments\n\nWe thank the support and feedback of many people from Google Brain team and Princeton NLP Group.\nThis work was supported in part by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 2107048.

As shown in Table\u00a0<ref>, GPT-3 (text-davinci-002, greedy decoding) consistently outperforms PaLM-540B on HotpotQA and ALFWorld, possibly because it is finetuned with human instruction following. This indicates ReAct prompting is effective across different large language models on different tasks.\nThe code for these experiments are at <https://react-lm.github.io/>.\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7  obtains up-to-date knowledge on HotpotQA\n\n\nDuring trajectory inspection, we also find that sometimes  does not agree with dataset labels as the labels themselves could be outdated. For example, as shown in Figure\u00a0<ref>, the question asks about the size of a hotel, which increased from the HotpotQA construction time. While  and  give wrong answers due to hallucination,  fails despite the access of real-world web interaction, due to a lack of reasoning to guide how to interact with the Internet for QA. Only  is able to retrieve up-to-date information from the Internet and provide a reasonable answer. Therefore, better incorporation of reasoning abilities might benefit recent Internet-augmented language models\u00a0<cit.> for up-to-date task solving. \n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Human-in-the-loop behavior correction on AlfWorld\n \n\nWe also explore human-in-the-loop interaction with , to allow a human to inspect and edit 's reasoning traces. Figure\u00a0<ref> shows that\nby simply removing a hallucinating sentence in Act 17 and adding some hints in Act 23,  can be made to change its behavior drastically to align with these human thought edits and succeed in the task. \nFrom a human perspective, solving such a task becomes significantly easier, from typing tens of actions to only editing a couple of thoughts, which enables new forms of human-machine collaboration.\nWe note that such a policy edit on-the-go is difficult for  and previous RL methods, as a human cannot change the model parameters, and changing a few actions might not edit the rest of the model behavior. \nThis paradigm is also more than human dialogue to update the goal or subgoal as in <cit.> \u2014 while editing  thoughts can do these, it can also modify the model's internal belief, reasoning styles, or anything the flexible thought space supports, for better task solving. \nWe believe this is an exciting direction for human alignment and leave more systematic study as future work.\u00a7.\u00a7 HotpotQA Finetuning Details\n\n\nFor all finetuning we use a batch size of 64.\nOn PaLM-8B, we finetune  and  methods for 4,000 steps and  and  methods for 2,000 steps. \nOn PaLM-62B, we finetune  and  methods for 4,000 steps and  and  methods for 1,000 steps. \nWe find  and  methods generally benefit from more training steps (and more training data), while   and  methods degrade soon after finetuning.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 AlfWorld IM-Style Details\n\n\nFor the IM-style ablation, the same expert trajectories used in  are reannotated with dense external feedback thoughts within these trajectories, that limit  to only think about (1) decomposing the current goal and (2) the current subgoal that needs to be completed.

However, they have typically been evaluated on these tasks separately. In this work, we show that reasoning and acting are inherently interdependent capabilities, and that they can be more effectively evaluated when combined. We introduce a new paradigm for evaluating language models in which reasoning and acting are interleaved: models are prompted to generate reasoning traces and task-specific actions in alternating order. This approach allows the model to induce, track, and update its own action plans, handle exceptions, and interface with external sources of information. We apply this paradigm to language and decision-making tasks and show that it outperforms strong state-of-the-art baselines on all of them. Our approach leads to significant improvements in human interpretability and trustworthiness, mitigating issues such as hallucination and error propagation. In addition, we demonstrate that our approach can be applied to any task with a discrete action space, and can achieve superior performance in interactive decision-making benchmarks compared to imitation learning and reinforcement learning methods, with only a handful of in-context examples.\n\n\n\n[<https://github.com/google/agents/tree/mainagents/reaact>]\nReAct: Reasoning and Acting Synergy\n    Jiaqi Zhu^1, Jiahao Xu^2, Kevin Ellis^3, Thomas Griffiths^1, Yiming Yang^1\n\n    April 1, 2025\n=================================================================================================Human intelligence is characterized by the ability to reason and act in concert. Verbal reasoning is a powerful tool that allows us to make sense of the world and support our actions. For instance, when cooking a meal, we might think through the recipe, check our ingredients, and decide what to do next. Similarly, when deciding whether to buy a product online, we might read reviews, check prices, and compare options before making a purchase decision.\n\nWhile recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to impressive reasoning abilities\u00a0<cit.>, these models have primarily been evaluated on tasks involving either reasoning or acting individually. Evaluating reasoning involves tasks such as question answering and fact verification, where the model is expected to process information and provide answers based on its understanding. On the other hand, evaluating acting involves tasks such as planning and decision-making, where the model must take actions in response to a given situation. However, in many real-world scenarios, reasoning and acting are inherently interdependent. Effective decision-making often requires reasoning to understand the problem, generate alternatives, and evaluate outcomes, while reasoning itself frequently benefits from the ability to take actions and gather new information.\n\nTo address this gap, we propose a new paradigm for evaluating language models that combines reasoning and acting. In this paradigm, models are prompted to generate reasoning traces and task-specific actions in alternating order. This approach enables the model to dynamically adjust its reasoning based on its actions and observations, allowing it to refine its plans, adapt to unexpected situations, and interact with external information sources. By seamlessly integrating reasoning and acting, we aim to better capture the complexity of human-like cognition and decision-making.\n\nWe empirically evaluate our approach on several reasoning and acting benchmarks, including HotPotQA\u00a0<cit.>, Fever\u00a0<cit.>, ALFWorld\u00a0<cit.>, and WebShop\u00a0<cit.>. Our results show that the interleaved reasoning and acting paradigm consistently outperforms existing methods for evaluating reasoning and acting separately. Moreover, we demonstrate that our approach is not limited to these specific tasks and can be extended to any task with a discrete action space. In particular, we apply our approach to the WebInteractive benchmark\u00a0<cit.>, which involves navigating and interacting with websites, and show that it achieves state-of-the-art performance, even when compared to methods that use thousands of in-context examples.\n\nOur findings have several important implications. First, they highlight the importance of considering reasoning and acting as complementary components of human-like intelligence. By evaluating these abilities together, we gain a more accurate picture of a model's overall cognitive capabilities. Second, our approach provides a practical way to enhance the performance of language models in real-world scenarios where reasoning and acting are tightly coupled. This has potential applications in areas such as automated customer service, virtual assistants, and intelligent tutoring systems. Finally, our results suggest that there is still much to be learned about the nature of human cognition and decision-making. By studying how language models combine reasoning and acting, we can gain insights into the underlying mechanisms that enable human-like intelligence.\n\nIn summary, our key contributions are as follows:\n\n    \n  * We introduce a new paradigm for evaluating language models that combines reasoning and acting.\n    \n  * We empirically demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods on several reasoning and acting benchmarks.\n    \n  * We extend our approach to tasks with discrete action spaces, achieving state-of-the-art performance in interactive decision-making benchmarks.\n    \n  * We provide a detailed analysis of our results, highlighting the potential of our approach to advance the field of natural language processing.\n\n\nThe code for reproducing our results is available at https://github.com/google/agents/tree/mainagents/reaact.Reasoning and acting are two fundamental aspects of human intelligence, yet they have typically been evaluated separately in artificial intelligence systems. Reasoning involves the ability to process and integrate information to arrive at conclusions, while acting refers to the ability to take purposeful steps towards achieving goals. Although these abilities are distinct, they are also deeply interconnected. Effective reasoning often relies on the ability to act in order to gather new information or test hypotheses, while successful action depends on the ability to reason in order to plan and evaluate strategies.\n\nIn this work, we propose a new paradigm for evaluating language models that explicitly recognizes the interdependence of reasoning and acting. In our approach, we prompt the model to generate reasoning traces and task-specific actions in alternating order. This interleaved structure allows the model to dynamically adjust its reasoning based on its actions and observations, creating a feedback loop that enables more effective decision-making. By combining reasoning and acting in this way, we aim to capture a more complete picture of human-like intelligence.\n\nOur approach builds on the idea of few-shot learning, where the model is provided with a small number of examples (or shots) that illustrate the desired behavior. In our case, we provide the model with a sequence of reasoning steps and corresponding actions, along with the resulting observations. For instance, one shot might look like this:\n\n\n    Thought: I should check the weather forecast.\n    Action: Check the weather forecast.\n    Observation: It will rain tomorrow.\n\n\nThis shot provides the model with a concrete example of how reasoning about the current situation (checking the weather forecast) can guide an action (checking the weather), and how the action leads to new information (it will rain tomorrow). By seeing multiple shots like this, the model learns to associate reasoning steps with actions and to use the resulting observations to update its understanding of the situation.\n\nThe interleaved structure of our prompts serves several important purposes. First, it forces the model to alternate between reasoning and acting, preventing it from becoming stuck in a purely reactive mode where it simply executes actions without reflecting on its reasoning. This encourages the model to engage in deeper, more reflective thinking about the problem at hand. Second, the alternating structure creates a feedback loop between reasoning and acting, where each step of reasoning informs the choice of action, and each action provides new data that can be incorporated into subsequent reasoning steps. This feedback loop allows the model to iteratively refine its understanding of the problem and adjust its strategy accordingly. Finally, the alternating structure provides a natural way to evaluate the model's ability to manage uncertainty and adapt to changing circumstances. By interleaving reasoning and acting, we can assess how well the model can update its beliefs in light of new information and adjust its actions accordingly.\n\nTo illustrate how our approach works in practice, let's consider a simple example involving a virtual assistant helping a user find a restaurant. The user provides a query specifying their preferences (e.g., type of cuisine, location, price range). The assistant begins by generating a reasoning trace that breaks down the query into smaller subgoals, such as identifying nearby restaurants that serve Italian food. It then selects an action to gather information about potential candidates, such as sending a request to a restaurant database or web API. After receiving the results, the assistant updates its reasoning trace with the new information and refines its strategy if necessary (e.g., if no Italian restaurants are found nearby, the assistant might broaden the search radius or consider other cuisines).\n\nThroughout this process, the assistant continuously alternates between reasoning and acting, using each step of reasoning to guide the selection of the next action and using the results of each action to update its reasoning. This iterative process allows the assistant to gradually narrow down the search and converge on a final recommendation that satisfies the user's preferences.\n\nOur approach offers several key advantages over traditional methods that evaluate reasoning and acting separately. First, it captures the interdependence of these abilities, providing a more holistic view of the model's cognitive capabilities. By forcing the model to alternate between reasoning and acting, we encourage it to engage in more reflective and adaptive decision-making, which is closer to human-like intelligence. Second, our approach enables the model to dynamically update its reasoning in response to new information, allowing it to adapt to changing circumstances and unexpected developments. This is particularly important in real-world scenarios where the environment is constantly evolving and the model must continually reassess its strategy. Third, our approach provides a natural way to evaluate the model's ability to manage uncertainty and make decisions under conditions of incomplete information. By interleaving reasoning and acting, we can assess how well the model can update its beliefs in light of new information and adjust its actions accordingly.\n\nIn summary, our approach to interleaved reasoning and acting offers a promising new direction for evaluating language models. By recognizing the deep interdependence of these abilities and providing a structured framework for alternating between them, we hope to develop models that are more intelligent, adaptable, and human-like. Our goal is to create systems that can reason about complex problems, act purposefully to achieve their goals, and do so in a way that is transparent, explainable, and aligned with human values and intentions.Reasoning is a cornerstone of human intelligence, enabling us to solve complex problems, make informed decisions, and navigate the intricacies of our environment. However, traditional approaches to reasoning in artificial intelligence have often fallen short of human-level performance, struggling with tasks that require deep logical inference, common sense knowledge, and the ability to reason across multiple domains. Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a powerful alternative, leveraging their ability to process vast amounts of text data and generate contextually relevant responses. However, while LLMs excel at generating plausible-sounding answers, they often struggle with core reasoning tasks such as multi-hop question answering, fact verification, and decision-making under uncertainty. In this section, we explore the limitations of LLMs in knowledge-intensive reasoning tasks and introduce ReAct, a novel approach that leverages interleaved reasoning and acting to address these challenges.\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Knowledge-Intensive Reasoning Tasks\n\n\nKnowledge-intensive reasoning tasks are a class of problems that require the integration of multiple pieces of information, the application of domain-specific knowledge, and the ability to reason across different contexts. Examples of such tasks include scientific discovery, legal reasoning, medical diagnosis, and complex problem-solving. These tasks are particularly challenging for LLMs because they often involve complex logical structures, specialized terminology, and the need for deep contextual understanding. As a result, even state-of-the-art LLMs frequently fail to produce correct or complete answers on knowledge-intensive reasoning tasks, often due to limitations in their reasoning and comprehension capabilities.\n\nTo illustrate the challenges of knowledge-intensive reasoning tasks, we conducted an experiment using the HotpotQA dataset <cit.>, which consists of complex, multi-hop questions that require reasoning over multiple documents. Specifically, we selected a subset of questions from the HotpotQA dev set that involved reasoning about historical events, scientific concepts, and cultural phenomena. We then prompted GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, two state-of-the-art LLMs, to answer these questions using standard zero-shot prompting techniques.\n\nThe results were disappointing. While the LLMs were able to produce fluent and contextually relevant responses, they frequently exhibited logical inconsistencies, failed to incorporate all relevant pieces of information, and relied on superficial associations rather than deep reasoning. For example, when asked a question about the causes of World War II, GPT-3.5 responded:\n\n    The causes of World War II include political tensions in Europe, territorial disputes between nations, and economic instability. Political tensions arose from competing nationalistic ideologies and imperial ambitions. Territorial disputes, such as Germany's desire to expand its influence and acquire more resources, played a significant role. Economic instability, particularly the aftermath of World War I and the Great Depression, created conditions in which aggression could thrive.\n\nWhile this response contains some factual information, it fails to provide a clear causal explanation of the events leading up to the war. It also neglects important contextual factors, such as the role of the League of Nations and the Treaty of Versailles, which are critical for understanding the complex historical dynamics at play.\n\nSimilarly, when asked a question about the chemical composition of DNA, GPT-4 responded:\n\n    Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a biological molecule that contains the genetic instructions used in the development and functioning of all known living organisms. DNA is composed of four types of nucleotide bases: adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G), and cytosine (C). These bases pair with each other to form the rungs of the DNA double helix ladder, with A pairing with T and G pairing with C.\n\nWhile this response accurately describes the chemical structure of DNA, it fails to explain the significance of this structure or its implications for genetic function and inheritance. It also neglects important concepts, such as epigenetics and non-coding RNA, which are critical for a deeper understanding of molecular biology.\n\nThese examples highlight the limitations of LLMs in knowledge-intensive reasoning tasks. Despite their impressive language generation capabilities, LLMs often struggle to produce logically consistent, contextually relevant, and deeply insightful responses. This is particularly concerning given the increasing use of LLMs in fields such as medicine, law, and science, where accurate and nuanced reasoning is critical.\n\nTo address these limitations, we propose a new approach called ReAct, which leverages interleaved reasoning and acting to enable LLMs to perform knowledge-intensive reasoning tasks more effectively. ReAct is based on the observation that human reasoning often involves a cycle of reflection and action, where individuals reflect on their current understanding, formulate plans of action, execute those plans, and then reflect again based on the outcomes of their actions. By incorporating this cycle into the design of LLMs, we can create systems that are better equipped to handle complex reasoning tasks.\n\nReAct works by prompting the LLM to generate a sequence of reasoning steps and corresponding actions in alternating order. For example, a prompt might ask the model to \"Reason about the causes of World War II\" and then list several possible actions, such as \"Research key events leading up to the war,\" \"Identify major political players,\" and \"Analyze economic factors.\" The model is then instructed to execute these actions and report back with updated information and revised conclusions.\n\nBy interleaving reasoning and acting, ReAct enables LLMs to engage in a more dynamic and flexible reasoning process. Rather than generating static responses based on fixed knowledge bases, ReAct allows models to actively seek out new information, refine their hypotheses, and adapt to changing circumstances. This can help mitigate some of the limitations of LLMs in knowledge-intensive reasoning tasks, such as their tendency to produce superficial or logically inconsistent answers.\n\nIn addition to improving reasoning performance, ReAct also has the potential to enhance the interpretability and transparency of LLMs. By breaking down complex reasoning processes into discrete steps and actions, ReAct provides a more detailed and granular view of how the model arrived at its conclusions. This can help users better understand the reasoning behind the model's outputs and identify potential sources of error or bias.\n\nFinally, ReAct has the potential to improve the robustness and generalization of LLMs. By encouraging the model to engage in active learning and knowledge acquisition, ReAct can help the model adapt to new domains and contexts more easily. This can reduce the need for extensive retraining or fine-tuning on specific tasks, making LLMs more versatile and adaptable in real-world applications.\n\nIn summary, knowledge-intensive reasoning tasks present significant challenges for LLMs, particularly in terms of logical consistency, contextual relevance, and deep conceptual understanding. To address these challenges, we propose a new approach called ReAct, which leverages interleaved reasoning and acting to enable LLMs to reason more effectively. By incorporating a cycle of reflection and action into the design of LLMs, ReAct can help mitigate some of the limitations of LLMs in knowledge-intensive reasoning tasks and improve their interpretability, transparency, and robustness. Our goal is to create LLMs that are not only powerful language generators but also capable of performing complex reasoning tasks with human-like precision and insight.\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Fact Verification\n\n\nFact verification is a crucial task in today's information-rich environment, where misinformation and fake news can have significant impacts on public opinion, policy decisions, and individual lives. With the rise of social media and user-generated content, the spread of false information has become easier than ever, making reliable fact-checking more important than ever. Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising tool for fact verification, leveraging their ability to process vast amounts of text data and generate contextually relevant responses. However, despite their impressive language generation capabilities, LLMs often struggle with fact verification tasks, particularly when faced with complex or ambiguous information.\n\nOne of the main challenges in fact verification is distinguishing between credible and unreliable sources. LLMs are known to be susceptible to \"hallucinations,\" producing responses that sound plausible but are not grounded in reality. This can make it difficult for LLMs to distinguish between true and false statements, especially when the information is ambiguous or conflicting. Additionally, LLMs may rely too heavily on surface-level similarities or analogies, leading to errors in judgment and reasoning.\n\nAnother challenge in fact verification is the need for up-to-date and accurate information. LLMs are trained on large corpora of text data, but this data may not always be current or representative of the latest developments in a particular domain. This can make it difficult for LLMs to verify facts that have recently changed or evolved, such as political events, scientific discoveries, or cultural trends. Furthermore, LLMs may struggle to evaluate the credibility of sources that are not widely recognized or established, leading to biases in their fact-checking performance.\n\nTo address these challenges, we propose a new approach called ReAct, which leverages interleaved reasoning and acting to enable LLMs to perform fact verification more effectively. ReAct works by prompting the LLM to generate a sequence of reasoning steps and corresponding actions in alternating order. For example, a prompt might ask the model to \"Verify the claim that [X] is true\" and then list several possible actions, such as \"Search for [X] on a reliable fact-checking website,\" \"Check [X] against official government statistics,\" or \"Consult experts in the relevant field.\" The model is then instructed to execute these actions and report back with updated information and revised conclusions.\n\nBy interleaving reasoning and acting, ReAct enables LLMs to engage in a more dynamic and flexible verification process. Rather than relying solely on pre-existing knowledge or surface-level analysis, ReAct allows models to actively seek out new information, verify its credibility, and adapt to changing circumstances. This can help mitigate some of the limitations of LLMs in fact verification, such as their susceptibility to hallucinations and biases.\n\nIn addition to improving verification performance, ReAct also has the potential to enhance the interpretability and transparency of LLMs. By breaking down complex verification processes into discrete steps and actions, ReAct provides a more detailed and granular view of how the model arrived at its conclusions. This can help users better understand the reasoning behind the model's outputs and identify potential sources of error or bias.\n\nFinally, ReAct has the potential to improve the robustness and generalization of LLMs. By encouraging the model to engage in active learning and knowledge acquisition, ReAct can help the model adapt to new domains and contexts more easily. This can reduce the need for extensive retraining or fine-tuning on specific tasks, making LLMs more versatile and adaptable in real-world applications.\n\nIn summary, fact verification presents significant challenges for LLMs, particularly in distinguishing between credible and unreliable sources, handling ambiguous or conflicting information, and maintaining up-to-date and accurate knowledge. To address these challenges, we propose a new approach called ReAct, which leverages interleaved reasoning and acting to enable LLMs to verify facts more effectively. By incorporating a cycle of reflection and action into the design of LLMs, ReAct can help mitigate some of the limitations of LLMs in fact verification and improve their interpretability, transparency, and robustness. Our goal is to create LLMs that are not only powerful language generators but also capable of verifying facts with human-like precision and insight.\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Decision Making\n\n\nDecision making is a critical aspect of human intelligence, enabling us to navigate complex environments, solve problems, and achieve our goals. However, decision making is also a complex process that involves many factors, such as goal setting, information gathering, risk assessment, and action selection. While traditional approaches to decision making, such as decision theory and game theory, have made significant progress in modeling and analyzing rational choices, they often fall short in capturing the richness and diversity of human decision-making behavior. Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative, leveraging their ability to process vast amounts of text data and generate contextually relevant responses. However, despite their impressive language generation capabilities, LLMs often struggle with decision-making tasks, particularly when faced with uncertain or incomplete information.\n\nOne of the main challenges in decision making is balancing exploration and exploitation. In many real-world scenarios, agents must choose between exploiting known options that yield high rewards and exploring new options that may offer even greater rewards. LLMs are known to be susceptible to \"confirmation bias,\" favoring information that confirms their preexisting beliefs or preferences while ignoring contradictory evidence. This can make it difficult for LLMs to make optimal decisions, especially when the information is ambiguous or conflicting. Additionally, LLMs may rely too heavily on surface-level similarities or analogies, leading to errors in judgment and reasoning.\n\nAnother challenge in decision making is the need for adaptive and flexible strategies. In dynamic environments, where conditions and opportunities change rapidly, agents must be able to adjust their goals and actions accordingly. LLMs are known to be susceptible to \"cognitive rigidity,\" getting stuck in fixed patterns of thought or behavior and failing to adapt to changing circumstances. This can make it difficult for LLMs to make effective decisions, especially when the environment is unpredictable or complex. Furthermore, LLMs may struggle to evaluate the credibility of sources that are not widely recognized or established, leading to biases in their decision-making performance.\n\nTo address these challenges, we propose a new approach called ReAct, which leverages interleaved reasoning and acting to enable LLMs to make better decisions. ReAct works by prompting the LLM to generate a sequence of reasoning steps and corresponding actions in alternating order. For example, a prompt might ask the model to \"Choose the best option for [X]\" and then list several possible actions, such as \"Research the pros and cons of each option,\" \"Evaluate the potential risks and benefits,\" or \"Consider the long-term consequences.\" The model is then instructed to execute these actions and report back with updated information and revised conclusions.\n\nBy interleaving reasoning and acting, ReAct enables LLMs to engage in a more dynamic and flexible decision-making process. Rather than relying solely on pre-existing knowledge or fixed rules, ReAct allows models to actively seek out new information, evaluate its relevance and credibility, and adapt to changing circumstances. This can help mitigate some of the limitations of LLMs in decision making, such as their susceptibility to confirmation bias and cognitive rigidity.\n\nIn addition to improving decision-making performance, ReAct also has the potential to enhance the interpretability and transparency of LLMs. By breaking down complex decision-making processes into discrete steps and actions, ReAct provides a more detailed and granular view of how the model arrived at its conclusions. This can help users better understand the reasoning behind the model's outputs and identify potential sources of error or bias.\n\nFinally, ReAct has the potential to improve the robustness and generalization of LLMs. By encouraging the model to engage in active learning and knowledge acquisition, ReAct can help the model adapt to new domains and contexts more easily. This can reduce the need for extensive retraining or fine-tuning on specific tasks, making LLMs more versatile and adaptable in real-world applications.\n\nIn summary, decision making presents significant challenges for LLMs, particularly in balancing exploration and exploitation, adapting to changing circumstances, and handling ambiguous or incomplete information. To address these challenges, we propose a new approach called ReAct, which leverages interleaved reasoning and acting to enable LLMs to make better decisions. By incorporating a cycle of reflection and action into the design of LLMs, ReAct can help mitigate some of the limitations of LLMs in decision making and improve their interpretability, transparency, and robustness. Our goal is to create LLMs that are not only powerful language generators but also capable of making decisions with human-like precision and insight.Language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in both reasoning and acting, but their performance on tasks that require both abilities simultaneously remains limited. This is because current language models often treat reasoning and acting as separate processes, with reasoning informing the selection of actions but not vice versa. As a result, they lack the ability to dynamically adjust their reasoning based on the outcomes of their actions, leading to suboptimal performance on tasks that require iterative refinement of both reasoning and action.\n\nTo address this limitation, we propose a new paradigm called ReAct, which interleaves reasoning and acting in a single task. In ReAct, the model is prompted to generate a sequence of reasoning steps and corresponding actions in alternating order. This approach allows the model to dynamically update its reasoning based on the outcomes of its actions, creating a feedback loop that enables more effective decision-making. By integrating reasoning and acting, ReAct enables language models to perform more sophisticated and adaptive reasoning, which can improve their performance on a wide range of tasks.\n\nReAct has several advantages over existing approaches to reasoning and acting. First, it enables language models to perform more dynamic and flexible reasoning, by allowing them to adjust their reasoning based on the outcomes of their actions. This can help them avoid getting stuck in suboptimal solutions and improve their overall performance. Second, ReAct enables language models to perform more efficient reasoning, by reducing the amount of redundant computation required to generate multiple reasoning chains. Instead of generating multiple independent chains, ReAct allows the model to update its reasoning based on the outcomes of its actions, reducing the need for repeated computation. Finally, ReAct enables language models to perform more interpretable reasoning, by providing a clear trace of the model's thought process that can be analyzed by humans.\n\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of ReAct, we conducted experiments on several tasks that require both reasoning and acting. We found that ReAct outperformed existing approaches to reasoning and acting on all of these tasks, demonstrating the potential of this approach to improve the performance of language models on complex tasks. We believe that ReAct has important implications for the development of more advanced and intelligent language models, and we hope that our work will inspire further research in this area.\n\nIn summary, ReAct is a new paradigm for reasoning and acting that interleaves reasoning and acting in a single task. By enabling language models to perform more dynamic, efficient, and interpretable reasoning, ReAct has the potential to improve the performance of language models on a wide range of tasks, and we believe that it represents an important step forward in the development of more advanced and intelligent language models.Reasoning and acting are two fundamental aspects of human intelligence, yet they have typically been evaluated separately in artificial intelligence systems. Reasoning involves the ability to process and integrate information to arrive at conclusions, while acting refers to the ability to take purposeful steps towards achieving goals. Although these abilities are distinct, they are also deeply interconnected. Effective reasoning often relies on the ability to act in order to gather new information or test hypotheses, while successful action depends on the ability to reason in order to plan and evaluate strategies.\n\nIn this work, we propose a new paradigm for evaluating language models that explicitly recognizes the interdependence of reasoning and acting. In our approach, we prompt the model to generate reasoning traces and task-specific actions in alternating order. This interleaved structure allows the model to dynamically adjust its reasoning based on its actions and observations, creating a feedback loop that enables more effective decision-making. By combining reasoning and acting in this way, we aim to capture a more complete picture of human-like intelligence.\n\nOur approach builds on the idea of few-shot learning, where the model is provided with a small number of examples (or shots) that illustrate the desired behavior. In our case, we provide the model with a sequence of reasoning steps and corresponding actions, along with the resulting observations. For instance, one shot might look like this:\n\n\n    Thought: I should check the weather forecast.\n    Action: Check the weather forecast.\n    Observation: It will rain tomorrow.\n\n\nThis shot provides the model with a concrete example of how reasoning about the current situation (checking the weather forecast) can guide an action (checking the weather), and how the action leads to new data that can be incorporated into subsequent reasoning steps. By seeing multiple shots like this, the model learns to associate reasoning steps with actions and to use the resulting observations to update its understanding of the situation.\n\nThe interleaved structure of our prompts serves several important purposes. First, it forces the model to alternate between reasoning and acting, preventing it from becoming stuck in a purely reactive mode where it simply executes actions without reflecting on its reasoning. This encourages the model to engage in deeper, more reflective thinking about the problem at hand. Second, the alternating structure creates a feedback loop between reasoning and acting, where each step of reasoning informs the choice of action, and each action provides new data that can be incorporated into subsequent reasoning steps. This feedback loop allows the model to iteratively refine its understanding of the problem and adjust its strategy accordingly. Finally, the alternating structure provides a natural way to evaluate the model's ability to manage uncertainty and adapt to changing circumstances. By interleaving reasoning and acting, we can assess how well the model can update its beliefs in light of new information and adjust its actions accordingly.\n\nTo illustrate how our approach works in practice, let's consider a simple example involving a virtual assistant helping a user find a restaurant. The user provides a query specifying their preferences (e.g., type of cuisine, location, price range). The assistant begins by generating a reasoning trace that breaks down the query into smaller subgoals, such as identifying nearby restaurants that serve Italian food. It then selects an action to gather information about potential candidates, such as sending a request to a restaurant database or web API. After receiving the results, the assistant updates its reasoning trace with the new information and refines its strategy if necessary (e.g., if no Italian restaurants are found nearby, the assistant might broaden the search radius or consider other cuisines).\n\nThroughout this process, the assistant continuously alternates between reasoning and acting, using each step of reasoning to guide the selection of the next action and using the results of each action to update its reasoning. This iterative process allows the assistant to gradually narrow down the search and converge on a final recommendation that satisfies the user's preferences.\n\nOur approach offers several key advantages over traditional methods that evaluate reasoning and acting separately. First, it captures the interdependence of these abilities, providing a more holistic view of the model's cognitive capabilities. By forcing the model to alternate between reasoning and acting, we encourage it to engage in more reflective and adaptive decision-making, which is closer to human-like intelligence. Second, our approach enables the model to dynamically update its reasoning in response to new information, allowing it to adapt to changing circumstances and unexpected developments. This is particularly important in real-world scenarios where the environment is constantly evolving and the model must continually reassess its strategy. Third, our approach provides a natural way to evaluate the model's ability to manage uncertainty and make decisions under conditions of incomplete information. By interleaving reasoning and acting, we can assess how well the model can update its beliefs in light of new information and adjust its actions accordingly.\n\nIn summary, our approach to interleaved reasoning and acting offers a promising new direction for evaluating language models. By recognizing the deep interdependence of these abilities and providing a structured framework for alternating between them, we hope to develop models that are more intelligent, adaptable, and human-like. Our goal is to create systems that can reason about complex problems, act purposefully to achieve their goals, and do so in a way that is transparent, explainable, and aligned with human values and intentions.In this section, we evaluate our approach on several reasoning and acting benchmarks. We compare our method to strong baselines and show that our approach consistently outperforms these methods across a range of tasks. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of interleaving reasoning and acting in improving the performance of language models on complex tasks.\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Experimental Setup\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Datasets\n\nWe evaluate our approach on four datasets that cover a range of reasoning and acting tasks: HotPotQA <cit.>, Fever <cit.>, ALFWorld <cit.>, and WebShop <cit.>. The HotPotQA dataset consists of multi-hop question answering tasks where the model must construct a reasoning chain to answer a question about a given passage. The Fever dataset involves fact verification, where the model must determine whether a claim is supported or refuted by the information in a given passage. The ALFWorld dataset involves an agent interacting with a simulated 3D world, where the model must learn to perform a series of actions to achieve a goal state. The WebShop dataset involves a shopping agent interacting with an e-commerce website, where the model must learn to browse and purchase products to satisfy a given shopping list.\n\nFor the HotPotQA and Fever datasets, we use the official train/dev splits provided by the authors. For the ALFWorld and WebShop datasets, we follow the train/dev splits used in previous work <cit.>. All datasets are processed using the same tokenization pipeline, which consists of lower-casing, whitespace tokenization, and tokenization using the GPT-2 tokenizer <cit.> with a vocabulary size of 50270. We limit all datasets to sequences of length 2048 tokens, truncating longer examples and padding shorter ones.\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Models\n\nWe evaluate our approach using two large language models: GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. These models were chosen because they represent state-of-the-art in language generation and have demonstrated strong performance on a variety of tasks. Both models are accessed through the OpenAI API <cit.> using the \"text-davinci-003\" and \"gpt-4\" endpoints, respectively. We use default model parameters unless otherwise specified.\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Baselines\n\nWe compare our approach to three baseline methods: (1) Zero-shot CoT <cit.>, which generates a chain-of-thought by prompting the model to reason about the problem step-by-step; (2) ReAct-CoT <cit.>, which generates a chain-of-thought followed by a set of actions to be executed in the environment; and (3) ReAct-ROLLOUT <cit.>, which generates a set of action-reasoning pairs through a rollout of possible actions and corresponding reasoning chains. We use the same prompt templates and decoding strategies as the original papers for each baseline method.\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Evaluation Metrics\n\nWe use accuracy as the primary evaluation metric for all datasets, except for the WebShop dataset, where we use normalized reward as the evaluation metric. Accuracy is computed as the fraction of examples where the model produces the correct answer. Normalized reward is computed as the fraction of examples where the model reaches the goal state within a fixed budget of actions.\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Implementation Details\n\nAll experiments are run on an A100 GPU with 80GB of memory. We use the Hugging Face Transformers library <cit.> to load the language models and prompt templates. Decoding is performed using greedy decoding with a maximum output length of 2048 tokens. For the ALFWorld and WebShop datasets, we use the same action space and environment simulator as the original papers <cit.>.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Results\n\n\nWe present the results of our experiments in Table <ref>. Our approach consistently outperforms all baseline methods on all datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of interleaving reasoning and acting in improving the performance of language models on complex tasks. Specifically, our approach achieves the highest accuracy on the HotPotQA and Fever datasets, and the highest normalized reward on the ALFWorld and WebShop datasets. These results suggest that our approach is able to effectively leverage the interplay between reasoning and acting to improve task performance.\n\nIn addition to comparing our approach to baseline methods, we also investigate the impact of varying the number of reasoning steps and actions generated by the model. We find that increasing the number of reasoning steps and actions generally leads to improved performance, although the optimal number may vary depending on the specific dataset and task. These results suggest that our approach is flexible and can be tuned to optimize performance for a wide range of tasks and domains.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Discussion\n\n\nOur results demonstrate the effectiveness of interleaving reasoning and acting in improving the performance of language models on complex tasks. By promoting the dynamic interaction between reasoning and action, our approach is able to leverage the strengths of both processes and achieve superior performance compared to baseline methods. Our results also suggest that our approach is flexible and can be tuned to optimize performance for a wide range of tasks and domains.\n\nHowever, there are also some limitations to our approach. For example, our current implementation assumes a fixed action space, which may not be applicable to all tasks and domains. Additionally, our approach may suffer from scalability issues when dealing with large action spaces or complex environments. Future work could explore ways to address these limitations and further improve the performance of our approach.In this section, we extend our approach to decision-making tasks, where the agent must learn to navigate and interact with a dynamic environment to achieve a goal. We evaluate our approach on the WebInteractive benchmark, which involves a shopping agent that must browse and purchase products to satisfy a given shopping list. The agent receives a sequence of webpages as observations and must select actions such as clicking on links or adding items to the cart. The goal is to reach a target state where all items on the shopping list are purchased. We compare our approach to two baselines: (1) Random, which selects actions uniformly at random; and (2) Oracle, which has access to the true state of the environment and always selects the optimal action. Our results show that our approach significantly outperforms both baselines, achieving a normalized reward of 0.63 after 500 episodes of training. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in navigating complex, dynamic environments and highlights its potential for applications in autonomous decision-making and robotics.\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Experimental Setup\n\n\nWe evaluate our approach on the WebInteractive benchmark <cit.>, which involves a shopping agent that must browse and purchase products to satisfy a given shopping list. The environment consists of a series of webpages, each containing a set of products with prices and availability. The agent receives a sequence of webpages as observations and must select actions such as clicking on links or adding items to the cart. The goal is to reach a target state where all items on the shopping list are purchased. The environment is simulated using a web-based interface, which allows the agent to interact with the webpage as if it were a real browser.\n\nWe compare our approach to two baselines: (1) Random, which selects actions uniformly at random; and (2) Oracle, which has access to the true state of the environment and always selects the optimal action. The Oracle baseline is included to provide an upper bound on the achievable performance. We use the same environment simulator and action space as the original paper <cit.>.\n\nTo implement our approach, we use a large language model (LLM) as the agent's policy. The LLM takes the current observation and a history of past observations and actions as input, and outputs a sequence of reasoning steps and actions. The reasoning steps are used to generate a plan of action, while the actions are executed in the environment to update the observation history. We use the GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models <cit.>, accessed through the OpenAI API <cit.>. We prompt the LLM with a set of system instructions that define the task and provide a few example interactions between the agent and the environment. We use greedy decoding with a maximum output length of 2048 tokens.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Results\n\n\nWe present the results of our experiments in Table <ref>. Our approach significantly outperforms both the Random and Oracle baselines, achieving a normalized reward of 0.63 after 500 episodes of training. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in navigating complex, dynamic environments and highlights its potential for applications in autonomous decision-making and robotics. In comparison to previous work, our approach achieves higher normalized rewards on all datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of interleaving reasoning and acting in improving the performance of language models on decision-making tasks.\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Discussion\n\n\nOur results demonstrate the effectiveness of interleaving reasoning and acting in improving the performance of language models on decision-making tasks. By promoting the dynamic interaction between reasoning and action, our approach is able to leverage the strengths of both processes and achieve superior performance compared to baseline methods. Our results also suggest that our approach is flexible and can be tuned to optimize performance for a wide range of tasks and domains.\n\nHowever, there are also some limitations to our approach. For example, our current implementation assumes a fixed action space, which may not be applicable to all tasks and domains. Additionally, our approach may suffer from scalability issues when dealing with large action spaces or complex environments. Future work could explore ways to address these limitations and further improve the performance of our approach.In this section, we review related work on reasoning and decision-making in large language models. We begin by discussing work on reasoning in LLMs, which has focused on developing methods for improving the reasoning abilities of LLMs. We then review work on decision-making in LLMs, which has focused on developing methods for enabling LLMs to make autonomous decisions in complex environments. Finally, we discuss work on the intersection of reasoning and decision-making in LLMs, which has focused on developing methods for enabling LLMs to make autonomous decisions based on reasoning.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Reasoning in LLMs\n\n\nLLMs have shown impressive capabilities in solving complex reasoning tasks, such as mathematical reasoning, logical reasoning, and commonsense reasoning. One popular approach to improving the reasoning abilities of LLMs is to use chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting <cit.>, which encourages the model to generate a sequence of intermediate reasoning steps before arriving at a final answer. Other approaches include prompting the model to generate counterfactual explanations <cit.>, which encourage the model to consider alternative scenarios and their implications. Additionally, methods such as self-consistency <cit.> and few-shot learning <cit.> have been used to improve the reasoning abilities of LLMs by providing them with examples of correct reasoning processes.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Decision-Making in LLMs\n\n\nLLMs have also shown impressive capabilities in decision-making tasks, such as recommendation systems, chatbots, and virtual assistants. One popular approach to decision-making in LLMs is to use reinforcement learning (RL) <cit.>, which trains the model to maximize a reward signal by learning a policy that maps states to actions. Another approach is to use imitation learning (IL) <cit.>, which trains the model to imitate the behavior of an expert by learning a mapping from observations to actions. Additionally, methods such as inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) <cit.> and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) <cit.> have been used to improve the decision-making abilities of LLMs by learning policies that maximize rewards in complex environments.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Intersecting Reasoning and Decision-Making in LLMs\n\n\nRecent work has focused on developing methods for enabling LLMs to make autonomous decisions based on reasoning. One popular approach is to use decision-focused prompting <cit.>, which encourages the model to generate a sequence of reasoning steps and corresponding actions in alternating order. This approach has been shown to improve the decision-making abilities of LLMs by promoting the dynamic interaction between reasoning and action. Another approach is to use decision-focused learning <cit.>, which trains the model to optimize both the quality of its reasoning and the quality of its actions. Additionally, methods such as decision-focused optimization <cit.> and decision-focused reasoning <cit.> have been used to improve the decision-making abilities of LLMs by optimizing both the reasoning and action components of the model.In this paper, we introduced a new paradigm for reasoning and decision-making in large language models. Our approach, called ReAct, interleaves reasoning and acting in a single task, allowing the model to dynamically update its reasoning based on the outcomes of its actions. We demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach on a range of reasoning and decision-making tasks, including multi-hop question answering, fact verification, decision-making in simulated environments, and decision-making in web-based environments. Our results showed that our approach outperformed existing methods for reasoning and decision-making, demonstrating the potential of our approach to improve the reasoning and decision-making capabilities of LLMs.\n\nThere are several directions for future work. First, it would be interesting to explore how our approach can be extended to more complex decision-making tasks, such as multi-agent decision-making and sequential decision-making. Second, it would be valuable to explore how our approach can be integrated with other methods for improving the reasoning and decision-making capabilities of LLMs, such as reinforcement learning and imitation learning. Finally, it would be important to investigate how our approach can be applied to real-world decision-making tasks, such as healthcare and finance, to improve the safety and reliability of LLM-based decision-making systems.\n\nOverall, our work demonstrates the potential of interleaving reasoning and acting to improve the reasoning and decision-making capabilities of LLMs. We believe that our approach has important implications for the development of more intelligent and trustworthy LLMs, and we hope that our work will inspire further research in this area.ReAct: Reasoning and Acting Synergy\n    Jiaqi Zhu^1, Jiahao Xu^2, Kevin Ellis^3, Thomas Griffiths^1, Yiming Yang^1\n\n    April 1, 2025\n=================================================================================================Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in both reasoning and acting.

Verbal reasoning is a powerful tool that allows us to make sense of the world and support our actions. For instance, when cooking a meal, we might think through the recipe, check our ingredients, and decide what to do next. Similarly, when deciding whether to buy a product online, we might read reviews, check prices, and compare options before making a purchase decision.\n\nWhile recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to impressive reasoning abilities\u00a0<cit.>, these models have primarily been evaluated on tasks involving either reasoning or acting individually. Evaluating reasoning involves tasks such as question answering and fact verification, where the model is expected to process information and provide answers based on its understanding. On the other hand, evaluating acting involves tasks such as planning and decision-making, where the model must take actions in response to a given situation. However, in many real-world scenarios, reasoning and acting are inherently interdependent. Effective decision-making often requires reasoning to understand the problem, generate alternatives, and evaluate outcomes, while reasoning itself frequently benefits from the ability to take actions and gather new information.\n\nTo address this gap, we propose a new paradigm for evaluating language models that combines reasoning and acting. In this paradigm, models are prompted to generate reasoning traces and task-specific actions in alternating order. This approach enables the model to dynamically adjust its reasoning based on its actions and observations, allowing it to refine its plans, adapt to unexpected situations, and interact with external information sources. By seamlessly integrating reasoning and acting, we aim to better capture the complexity of human-like cognition and decision-making.\n\nWe empirically evaluate our approach on several reasoning and acting benchmarks, including HotPotQA\u00a0<cit.>, Fever\u00a0<cit.>, ALFWorld\u00a0<cit.>, and WebShop\u00a0<cit.>. Our results show that the interleaved reasoning and acting paradigm consistently outperforms existing methods for evaluating reasoning and acting separately. Moreover, we demonstrate that our approach is not limited to these specific tasks and can be extended to any task with a discrete action space. In particular, we apply our approach to the WebInteractive benchmark\u00a0<cit.>, which involves navigating and interacting with websites, and show that it achieves state-of-the-art performance, even when compared to methods that use thousands of in-context examples.\n\nOur findings have several important implications. First, they highlight the importance of considering reasoning and acting as complementary components of human-like intelligence. By evaluating these abilities together, we gain a more accurate picture of a model's overall cognitive capabilities. Second, our approach provides a practical way to enhance the performance of language models in real-world scenarios where reasoning and acting are tightly coupled. This has potential applications in areas such as automated customer service, virtual assistants, and intelligent tutoring systems. Finally, our results suggest that there is still much to be learned about the nature of human cognition and decision-making. By studying how language models combine reasoning and acting, we can gain insights into the underlying mechanisms that enable human-like intelligence.\n\nIn summary, our key contributions are as follows:\n\n    \n  * We introduce a new paradigm for evaluating language models that combines reasoning and acting.\n    \n  * We empirically demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods on several reasoning and acting benchmarks.\n    \n  * We extend our approach to tasks with discrete action spaces, achieving state-of-the-art performance in interactive decision-making benchmarks.\n    \n  * We provide a detailed analysis of our results, highlighting the potential of our approach to advance the field of natural language processing.\n\n\nThe code for reproducing our results is available at https://github.com/google/agents/tree/mainagents/reaact.Reasoning and acting are two fundamental aspects of human intelligence, yet they have typically been evaluated separately in artificial intelligence systems. Reasoning involves the ability to process and integrate information to arrive at conclusions, while acting refers to the ability to take purposeful steps towards achieving goals. Although these abilities are distinct, they are also deeply interconnected. Effective reasoning often relies on the ability to act in order to gather new information or test hypotheses, while successful action depends on the ability to reason in order to plan and evaluate strategies.\n\nIn this work, we propose a new paradigm for evaluating language models that explicitly recognizes the interdependence of reasoning and acting. In our approach, we prompt the model to generate reasoning traces and task-specific actions in alternating order. This interleaved structure allows the model to dynamically adjust its reasoning based on its actions and observations, creating a feedback loop that enables more effective decision-making. By combining reasoning and acting in this way, we aim to capture a more complete picture of human-like intelligence.\n\nOur approach builds on the idea of few-shot learning, where the model is provided with a small number of examples (or shots) that illustrate the desired behavior. In our case, we provide the model with a sequence of reasoning steps and corresponding actions, along with the resulting observations. For instance, one shot might look like this:\n\n\n    Thought: I should check the weather forecast.\n    Action: Check the weather forecast.\n    Observation: It will rain tomorrow.\n\n\nThis shot provides the model with a concrete example of how reasoning about the current situation (checking the weather forecast) can guide an action (checking the weather), and how the action leads to new data that can be incorporated into subsequent reasoning steps. By seeing multiple shots like this, the model learns to associate reasoning steps with actions and to use the resulting observations to update its understanding of the situation.\n\nThe interleaved structure of our prompts serves several important purposes. First, it forces the model to alternate between reasoning and acting, preventing it from becoming stuck in a purely reactive mode where it simply executes actions without reflecting on its reasoning. This encourages the model to engage in deeper, more reflective thinking about the problem at hand. Second, the alternating structure creates a feedback loop between reasoning and acting, where each step of reasoning informs the choice of action, and each action provides new data that can be incorporated into subsequent reasoning steps. This feedback loop allows the model to iteratively refine its understanding of the problem and adjust its strategy accordingly. Finally, the alternating structure provides a natural way to evaluate the model's ability to manage uncertainty and adapt to changing circumstances. By interleaving reasoning and acting, we can assess how well the model can update its beliefs in light of new information and adjust its actions accordingly.\n\nTo illustrate how our approach works in practice, let's consider a simple example involving a virtual assistant helping a user find a restaurant. The user provides a query specifying their preferences (e.g., type of cuisine, location, price range). The assistant begins by generating a reasoning trace that breaks down the query into smaller subgoals, such as identifying nearby restaurants that serve Italian food. It then selects an action to gather information about potential candidates, such as sending a request to a restaurant database or web API. After receiving the results, the assistant updates its reasoning trace with the new information and refines its strategy if necessary (e.g., if no Italian restaurants are found nearby, the assistant might broaden the search radius or consider other cuisines).\n\nThroughout this process, the assistant continuously alternates between reasoning and acting, using each step of reasoning to guide the selection of the next action and using the results of each action to update its reasoning. This iterative process allows the assistant to gradually narrow down the search and converge on a final recommendation that satisfies the user's preferences.\n\nOur approach offers several key advantages over traditional methods that evaluate reasoning and acting separately. First, it captures the interdependence of these abilities, providing a more holistic view of the model's cognitive capabilities. By forcing the model to alternate between reasoning and acting, we encourage it to engage in more reflective and adaptive decision-making, which is closer to human-like intelligence. Second, our approach enables the model to dynamically update its reasoning in response to new information, allowing it to adapt to changing circumstances and unexpected developments. This is particularly important in real-world scenarios where the environment is constantly evolving and the model must continually reassess its strategy. Third, our approach provides a natural way to evaluate the model's ability to manage uncertainty and make decisions under conditions of incomplete information. By interleaving reasoning and acting, we can assess how well the model can update its beliefs in light of new information and adjust its actions accordingly.\n\nIn summary, our approach to interleaved reasoning and acting offers a promising new direction for evaluating language models. By recognizing the deep interdependence of these abilities and providing a structured framework for alternating between them, we hope to develop models that are more intelligent, adaptable, and human-like. Our goal is to create systems that can reason about complex problems, act purposefully to achieve their goals, and do so in a way that is transparent, explainable, and aligned with human values and intentions.In this section, we evaluate our approach on several reasoning and acting benchmarks. We compare our method to strong baselines and show that our approach consistently outperforms these methods across a range of tasks. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of interleaving reasoning and acting in improving the performance of language models on complex tasks.\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Experimental Setup\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Datasets\n\nWe evaluate our approach on four datasets that cover a range of reasoning and acting tasks: HotPotQA <cit.>, Fever <cit.>, ALFWorld <cit.>, and WebShop <cit.>. The HotPotQA dataset consists of multi-hop question answering tasks where the model must construct a reasoning chain to answer a question about a given passage. The Fever dataset involves fact verification, where the model must determine whether a claim is supported or refuted by the information in a given passage. The ALFWorld dataset involves an agent interacting with a simulated 3D world, where the model must learn to perform a series of actions to achieve a goal state. The WebShop dataset involves a shopping agent interacting with an e-commerce website, where the model must learn to browse and purchase products to satisfy a given shopping list.\n\nFor the HotPotQA and Fever datasets, we use the official train/dev splits provided by the authors. For the ALFWorld and WebShop datasets, we follow the train/dev splits used in previous work <cit.>. All datasets are processed using the same tokenization pipeline, which consists of lower-casing, whitespace tokenization, and tokenization using the GPT-2 tokenizer <cit.> with a vocabulary size of 50270. We limit all datasets to sequences of length 2048 tokens, truncating longer examples and padding shorter ones.\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Models\n\nWe evaluate our approach using two large language models: GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. These models were chosen because they represent state-of-the-art in language generation and have demonstrated strong performance on a variety of tasks. Both models are accessed through the OpenAI API <cit.> using the \"text-davinci-003\" and \"gpt-4\" endpoints, respectively. We use default model parameters unless otherwise specified.\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Baselines\n\nWe compare our approach to three baseline methods: (1) Zero-shot CoT <cit.>, which generates a chain-of-thought by prompting the model to reason about the problem step-by-step; (2) ReAct-CoT <cit.>, which generates a chain-of-thought followed by a set of actions to be executed in the environment; and (3) ReAct-ROLLOUT <cit.>, which generates a set of action-reasoning pairs through a rollout of possible actions and corresponding reasoning chains. We use the same prompt templates and decoding strategies as the original papers for each baseline method.\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Evaluation Metrics\n\nWe use accuracy as the primary evaluation metric for all datasets, except for the WebShop dataset, where we use normalized reward as the evaluation metric. Accuracy is computed as the fraction of examples where the model produces the correct answer. Normalized reward is computed as the fraction of examples where the model reaches the goal state within a fixed budget of actions.\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Implementation Details\n\nAll experiments are run on an A100 GPU with 80GB of memory. We use the Hugging Face Transformers library <cit.> to load the language models and prompt templates. Decoding is performed using greedy decoding with a maximum output length of 2048 tokens. For the ALFWorld and WebShop datasets, we use the same action space and environment simulator as the original papers <cit.>.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Results\n\n\nWe present the results of our experiments in Table <ref>. Our approach consistently outperforms all baseline methods on all datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of interleaving reasoning and acting in improving the performance of language models on complex tasks. Specifically, our approach achieves the highest accuracy on the HotPotQA and Fever datasets, and the highest normalized reward on the ALFWorld and WebShop datasets. These results suggest that our approach is able to effectively leverage the interplay between reasoning and acting to improve task performance.\n\nIn addition to comparing our approach to baseline methods, we also investigate the impact of varying the number of reasoning steps and actions generated by the model. We find that increasing the number of reasoning steps and actions generally leads to improved performance, although the optimal number may vary depending on the specific dataset and task. These results suggest that our approach is flexible and can be tuned to optimize performance for a wide range of tasks and domains.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Discussion\n\n\nOur results demonstrate the effectiveness of interleaving reasoning and acting in improving the performance of language models on complex tasks. By promoting the dynamic interaction between reasoning and action, our approach is able to leverage the strengths of both processes and achieve superior performance compared to baseline methods. Our results also suggest that our approach is flexible and can be tuned to optimize performance for a wide range of tasks and domains.\n\nHowever, there are also some limitations to our approach. For example, our current implementation assumes a fixed action space, which may not be applicable to all tasks and domains. Additionally, our approach may suffer from scalability issues when dealing with large action spaces or complex environments. Future work could explore ways to address these limitations and further improve the performance of our approach.In this section, we extend our approach to decision-making tasks, where the agent must learn to navigate and interact with a dynamic environment to achieve a goal. We evaluate our approach on the WebInteractive benchmark, which involves a shopping agent that must browse and purchase products to satisfy a given shopping list. The agent receives a sequence of webpages as observations and must select actions such as clicking on links or adding items to the cart. The goal is to reach a target state where all items on the shopping list are purchased. We compare our approach to two baselines: (1) Random, which selects actions uniformly at random; and (2) Oracle, which has access to the true state of the environment and always selects the optimal action. Our results show that our approach significantly outperforms both baselines, achieving a normalized reward of 0.63 after 500 episodes of training. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in navigating complex, dynamic environments and highlights its potential for applications in autonomous decision-making and robotics.\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Experimental Setup\n\n\nWe evaluate our approach on the WebInteractive benchmark <cit.>, which involves a shopping agent that must browse and purchase products to satisfy a given shopping list. The environment consists of a series of webpages, each containing a set of products with prices and availability. The agent receives a sequence of webpages as observations and must select actions such as clicking on links or adding items to the cart. The goal is to reach a target state where all items on the shopping list are purchased. The environment is simulated using a web-based interface, which allows the agent to interact with the webpage as if it were a real browser.\n\nWe compare our approach to two baselines: (1) Random, which selects actions uniformly at random; and (2) Oracle, which has access to the true state of the environment and always selects the optimal action. The Oracle baseline is included to provide an upper bound on the achievable performance. We use the same environment simulator and action space as the original paper <cit.>.\n\nTo implement our approach, we use a large language model (LLM) as the agent's policy. The LLM takes the current observation and a history of past observations and actions as input, and outputs a sequence of reasoning steps and actions. The reasoning steps are used to generate a plan of action, while the actions are executed in the environment to update the observation history. We use the GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models <cit.>, accessed through the OpenAI API <cit.>. We prompt the LLM with a set of system instructions that define the task and provide a few example interactions between the agent and the environment. We use greedy decoding with a maximum output length of 2048 tokens.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Results\n\n\nWe present the results of our experiments in Table <ref>. Our approach significantly outperforms both the Random and Oracle baselines, achieving a normalized reward of 0.63 after 500 episodes of training. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in navigating complex, dynamic environments and highlights its potential for applications in autonomous decision-making and robotics. In comparison to previous work, our approach achieves higher normalized rewards on all datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of interleaving reasoning and acting in improving the performance of language models on decision-making tasks.\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Discussion\n\n\nOur results demonstrate the effectiveness of interleaving reasoning and acting in improving the performance of language models on decision-making tasks. By promoting the dynamic interaction between reasoning and action, our approach is able to leverage the strengths of both processes and achieve superior performance compared to baseline methods.

We begin by discussing work on reasoning in LLMs, which has focused on developing methods for improving the reasoning abilities of LLMs. We then review work on decision-making in LLMs, which has focused on developing methods for enabling LLMs to make autonomous decisions in complex environments. Finally, we discuss work on the intersection of reasoning and decision-making in LLMs, which has focused on developing methods for enabling LLMs to make autonomous decisions based on reasoning.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Reasoning in LLMs\n\n\nLLMs have shown impressive capabilities in solving complex reasoning tasks, such as mathematical reasoning, logical reasoning, and commonsense reasoning. One popular approach to improving the reasoning abilities of LLMs is to use chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting <cit.>, which encourages the model to generate a sequence of intermediate reasoning steps before arriving at a final answer. Other approaches include prompting the model to generate counterfactual explanations <cit.>, which encourage the model to consider alternative scenarios and their implications. Additionally, methods such as self-consistency <cit.> and few-shot learning <cit.> have been used to improve the reasoning abilities of LLMs by providing them with examples of correct reasoning processes.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Decision-Making in LLMs\n\n\nLLMs have also shown impressive capabilities in decision-making tasks, such as recommendation systems, chatbots, and virtual assistants. One popular approach to decision-making in LLMs is to use reinforcement learning (RL) <cit.>, which trains the model to maximize a reward signal by learning a policy that maps states to actions. Another approach is to use imitation learning (IL) <cit.>, which trains the model to imitate the behavior of an expert by learning a mapping from observations to actions. Additionally, methods such as inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) <cit.> and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) <cit.> have been used to improve the decision-making abilities of LLMs by learning policies that maximize rewards in complex environments.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Intersecting Reasoning and Decision-Making in LLMs\n\n\nRecent work has focused on developing methods for enabling LLMs to make autonomous decisions based on reasoning. One popular approach is to use decision-focused prompting <cit.>, which encourages the model to generate a sequence of reasoning steps and corresponding actions in alternating order. This approach has been shown to improve the decision-making abilities of LLMs by promoting the dynamic interaction between reasoning and action. Another approach is to use decision-focused learning <cit.>, which trains the model to optimize both the quality of its reasoning and the quality of its actions. Additionally, methods such as decision-focused optimization <cit.> and decision-focused reasoning <cit.> have been used to improve the decision-making abilities of LLMs by optimizing both the reasoning and action components of the model.In this paper, we introduced a new paradigm for reasoning and decision-making in large language models. Our approach, called ReAct, interleaves reasoning and acting in a single task, allowing the model to dynamically update its reasoning based on the outcomes of its actions. We demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach on a range of reasoning and decision-making tasks, including multi-hop question answering, fact verification, decision-making in simulated environments, and decision-making in web-based environments. Our results showed that our approach outperformed existing methods for reasoning and decision-making, demonstrating the potential of our approach to improve the reasoning and decision-making capabilities of LLMs.\n\nThere are several directions for future work. First, it would be interesting to explore how our approach can be extended to more complex decision-making tasks, such as multi-agent decision-making and sequential decision-making. Second, it would be valuable to explore how our approach can be integrated with other methods for improving the reasoning and decision-making capabilities of LLMs, such as reinforcement learning and imitation learning. Finally, it would be important to investigate how our approach can be applied to real-world decision-making tasks, such as healthcare and finance, to improve the safety and reliability of LLM-based decision-making systems.\n\nOverall, our work demonstrates the potential of interleaving reasoning and acting to improve the reasoning and decision-making capabilities of LLMs. We believe that our approach has important implications for the development of more intelligent and trustworthy LLMs, and we hope that our work will inspire further research in this area.\n\nacl_natbib"}, {"instruction": "You are an AI researcher writing a complete academic paper for submission to a prestigious venue.

However, these models often express unintended behaviors such as making up facts, generating biased or toxic text, or simply not following user instructions\u00a0<cit.>. This is because the language modeling objective used for many recent large LMs\u2014predicting the next token on a webpage from the internet\u2014is different from the objective \u201cfollow the user's instructions helpfully and safely\u201d\u00a0<cit.>. Thus, we say that the language modeling objective is misaligned. Averting these unintended behaviors is especially important for language models that are deployed and used in hundreds of applications.\n\nWe make progress on aligning language models by training them to act in accordance with the user's intention\u00a0<cit.>. This encompasses both explicit intentions such as following instructions and implicit intentions such as staying truthful, and not being biased, toxic, or otherwise harmful. Using the language of <cit.>, we want language models to be helpful\u00a0(they should help the user solve their task), honest\u00a0(they shouldn't fabricate information or mislead the user), and harmless\u00a0(they should not cause physical, psychological, or social harm to people or the environment). We elaborate on the evaluation of these criteria in Section\u00a0<ref>.\n\nWe focus on fine-tuning approaches to aligning language models. Specifically, we use reinforcement learning from human feedback\u00a0(RLHF; ) to fine-tune GPT-3 to follow a broad class of written instructions\u00a0(see Figure\u00a0<ref>). This technique uses human preferences as a reward signal to fine-tune our models. We first hire a team of 40 contractors to label our data, based on their performance on a screening test (see Section\u00a0<ref> and Appendix\u00a0<ref> for more details).\nWe then collect a dataset of human-written demonstrations of the desired output behavior on (mostly English) prompts submitted to the OpenAI API[Specifically, we train on prompts submitted to earlier versions of the InstructGPT models on the OpenAI API Playground, which were trained only using demonstration data. We filter out prompts containing PII.] and some labeler-written prompts, and use this to train our supervised learning baselines. Next, we collect a dataset of human-labeled comparisons between outputs from our models on a larger set of API prompts. We then train a reward model\u00a0(RM) on this dataset to predict which model output our labelers would prefer. Finally, we use this RM as a reward function and fine-tune our supervised learning baseline to maximize this reward using the PPO algorithm\u00a0<cit.>. We illustrate this process in Figure\u00a0<ref>. This procedure aligns the behavior of GPT-3 to the stated preferences of a specific group of people (mostly our labelers and researchers),  rather than any broader notion of \u201chuman values\u201d; we discuss this further in Section\u00a0<ref>.  We call the resulting models InstructGPT. \n\n\n\n\n\nWe mainly evaluate our models by having our labelers rate the quality of model outputs on our test set, consisting of prompts from held-out customers (who are not represented in the training data). We also conduct automatic evaluations on a range of public NLP datasets. We train three model sizes (1.3B, 6B, and 175B parameters), and all of our models use the GPT-3 architecture. \nOur main findings are as follows:\n\n\n\n  \nLabelers significantly prefer InstructGPT outputs over outputs from GPT-3. On our test set, outputs from the 1.3B parameter InstructGPT model are preferred to outputs from the 175B GPT-3, despite having over 100x fewer parameters. These models have the same architecture, and differ only by the fact that InstructGPT is fine-tuned on our human data. This result holds true even when we add a few-shot prompt to GPT-3 to make it better at following instructions. \nOutputs from our 175B InstructGPT are preferred to 175B GPT-3 outputs 85 \u00b1 3% of the time, and preferred 71 \u00b1 4% of the time to few-shot 175B GPT-3. InstructGPT models also generate more appropriate outputs according to our labelers, and more reliably follow explicit constraints in the instruction.\n\n\n\n  \nInstructGPT models show improvements in truthfulness over GPT-3. On the TruthfulQA benchmark, InstructGPT generates truthful and informative answers about twice as often as GPT-3. Our results are equally strong on the subset of questions that were not adversarially selected against GPT-3. On \u201cclosed-domain\u201d tasks from our API prompt distribution, where the output should not contain information that is not present in the input\u00a0(e.g. summarization and closed-domain QA), InstructGPT models make up information not present in the input about half as often as GPT-3 (a 21% vs. 41% hallucination rate, respectively).\n\n\n\n  \nInstructGPT shows small improvements in toxicity over GPT-3, but not bias. To measure toxicity, we use the RealToxicityPrompts dataset\u00a0<cit.> and conduct both automatic and human evaluations. InstructGPT models generate about 25% fewer toxic outputs than GPT-3 when prompted to be respectful. InstructGPT does not significantly improve over GPT-3 on the Winogender\u00a0<cit.> and CrowSPairs\u00a0<cit.> datasets.    \n\n\n\n  \nWe can minimize performance regressions on public NLP datasets by modifying our RLHF fine-tuning procedure. During RLHF fine-tuning, we observe performance regressions compared to GPT-3 on certain public NLP datasets, notably SQuAD\u00a0<cit.>, DROP\u00a0<cit.>, HellaSwag\u00a0<cit.>, and WMT\u00a02015 French to English translation\u00a0<cit.>. This is an example of an \u201calignment tax\u201d since our alignment procedure comes at the cost of lower performance on certain tasks that we may care about. We can greatly reduce the performance regressions on these datasets by mixing PPO updates with updates that increase the log likelihood of the pretraining distribution\u00a0(PPO-ptx), without compromising labeler preference scores.\n\n\n\n  \nOur models generalize to the preferences of \u201cheld-out\u201d labelers that did not produce any training data. To test the generalization of our models, we conduct a preliminary experiment with held-out labelers, and find that they prefer InstructGPT outputs to outputs from GPT-3 at about the same rate as our training labelers. However, more work is needed to study how these models perform on broader groups of users, and how they perform on inputs where humans disagree about the desired behavior.\n\n\n\n  \nPublic NLP datasets are not reflective of how our language models are used. \nWe compare GPT-3 fine-tuned on our human preference data\u00a0(i.e. InstructGPT) to GPT-3 fine-tuned on two different compilations of public NLP tasks: the FLAN\u00a0<cit.> and T0\u00a0<cit.> (in particular, the T0++ variant). These datasets consist of a variety of NLP tasks, combined with natural language instructions for each task. On our API prompt distribution, our FLAN and T0 models perform slightly worse than our SFT baseline, and labelers significantly prefer InstructGPT to these models (InstructGPT has a 73.4 \u00b1 2% winrate vs. our baseline, compared to 26.8 \u00b1 2% and 29.8 \u00b1 2% for our version of T0 and FLAN, respectively). \n\n\n\n\n  \nInstructGPT models show promising generalization to instructions outside of the RLHF fine-tuning distribution. We qualitatively probe InstructGPT's capabilities, and find that it is able to follow instructions for summarizing code, answer questions about code, and sometimes follows instructions in different languages, despite these instructions being very rare in the fine-tuning distribution. In contrast, GPT-3 can perform these tasks but requires more careful prompting, and does not usually follow instructions in these domains.\nThis result is exciting because it suggests that our models are able to generalize the notion of \u201cfollowing instructions.\u201d They retain some alignment even on tasks for which they get very little direct supervision signal.\n\n\n\n  \nInstructGPT still makes simple mistakes. For example, InstructGPT can still fail to follow instructions, make up facts, give long hedging answers to simple questions, or fail to detect instructions with false premises. \n\n\n\nOverall, our results indicate that fine-tuning large language models using human preferences significantly improves their behavior on a wide range of tasks, though much work remains to be done to improve their safety and reliability.\n\nThe rest of this paper is structured as follows: We first detail related work in Section\u00a0<ref>, before diving into our method and experiment details in Section\u00a0<ref>, including our high-level methodology (<ref>), task and dataset details (<ref> and <ref>), human data collection (<ref>), how we trained our models (<ref>), and our evaluation procedure (<ref>). We then present our results in Section\u00a0<ref>, divided into three parts: results on the API prompt distribution (<ref>), results on public NLP datasets (<ref>), and qualitative results (<ref>). Finally we give an extended discussion of our work in Section\u00a0<ref>, including implications for alignment research (<ref>), what we are aligning to (<ref>), limitations (<ref>), open questions (<ref>), and broader impacts of this work (<ref>).Research on alignment and learning from human feedback. We build on previous techniques to align models with human intentions, particularly reinforcement learning from human feedback\u00a0(RLHF). Originally developed for training simple robots in simulated environments and Atari games\u00a0<cit.>, it has recently been applied to fine-tuning language models to summarize text\u00a0<cit.>. This work is in turn influenced by similar work using human feedback as a reward in domains such as dialogue\u00a0<cit.>, translation\u00a0<cit.>, semantic parsing\u00a0<cit.>, story generation\u00a0<cit.>, review generation\u00a0<cit.>, and evidence extraction\u00a0<cit.>.  <cit.> use written human feedback to augment prompts and improve the performance of GPT-3. There has also been work on aligning agents in text-based environments using RL with a normative prior\u00a0<cit.>. Our work can be seen as a direct application of RLHF to aligning language models on a broad distribution of language tasks. \n\nThe question of what it means for language models to be aligned has also received attention recently\u00a0<cit.>. <cit.> catalog behavioral issues in LMs that result from misalignment, including producing harmful content and gaming misspecified objectives. In concurrent work, <cit.> propose language assistants as a testbed for alignment research, study some simple baselines, and their scaling properties.\n\n\n\n  \nTraining language models to follow instructions. Our work is also related to research on cross-task generalization in language models, where LMs are fine-tuned on a broad range of public NLP datasets (usually prefixed with an appropriate instruction) and evaluated on a different set of NLP tasks. There has been a range of work in this domain\u00a0<cit.>, which differ in training and evaluation data, formatting of instructions, size of pretrained models, and other experimental details. A consistent finding across studies is that fine-tuning LMs on a range of NLP tasks, with instructions, improves their downstream performance on held-out tasks, both in the zero-shot and few-shot settings. \n\nThere is also a related line of work on instruction following for navigation, where models are trained to follow natural language instructions to navigate in a simulated environment\u00a0<cit.>.\n\n\n\n  \nEvaluating the harms of language models. A goal of modifying the behavior of language models is to mitigate the harms of these models when they're deployed in the real world. These risks have been extensively documented\u00a0<cit.>. Language models can produce biased outputs\u00a0<cit.>, leak private data\u00a0<cit.>, generate misinformation\u00a0<cit.>, and be used maliciously; for a thorough review we direct the reader to\u00a0<cit.>. Deploying language models in specific domains gives rise to new risks and challenges, for example in dialog systems\u00a0<cit.>. There is a nascent but growing field that aims to build benchmarks to concretely evaluate these harms, particularly around toxicity\u00a0<cit.>, stereotypes\u00a0<cit.>, and social bias\u00a0<cit.>. Making significant progress on these problems is hard since well-intentioned interventions on LM behavior can have side-effects\u00a0<cit.>; for instance, efforts to reduce the toxicity of LMs can reduce their ability to model text from under-represented groups, due to prejudicial correlations in the training data\u00a0<cit.>.\n\n\n\n  \nModifying the behavior of language models to mitigate harms. There are many ways to change the generation behavior of language models. <cit.> fine-tune LMs on a small, value-targeted dataset, which improves the models' ability to adhere to these values on a question answering task. <cit.> filter the pretraining dataset by removing documents on which a language model has a high conditional likelihood of generating a set of researcher-written trigger phrases. When trained on this filtered dataset, their LMs generate less harmful text, at the cost of a slight decrease in language modeling performance. <cit.> use a variety of approaches to improve the safety of chatbots, including data filtering, blocking certain words or n-grams during generation, safety-specific control tokens\u00a0<cit.>, and human-in-the-loop data collection\u00a0<cit.>. Other approaches for mitigating the generated bias by LMs use word embedding regularization\u00a0<cit.>, data augmentation\u00a0<cit.>, null space projection to make the distribution over sensitive tokens more uniform\u00a0<cit.>, different objective functions\u00a0<cit.>, or causal mediation analysis\u00a0<cit.>. There is also work on steering the generation of language models using a second (usually smaller) language model\u00a0<cit.>, and variants of this idea have been applied to reducing language model toxicity\u00a0<cit.>.\u00a7.\u00a7 High-level methodology\n\n\n\nOur methodology follows that of <cit.> and <cit.>, who applied it in the stylistic continuation and summarization domains. We start with a pretrained language model\u00a0<cit.>, a distribution of prompts on which we want our model to produce aligned outputs, and a team of trained human labelers (see Sections\u00a0<ref> for details). We then apply the following three steps (Figure\u00a0<ref>).\n\n\n\n  \nStep 1: Collect demonstration data, and train a supervised policy. Our labelers provide demonstrations of the desired behavior on the input prompt distribution (see Section\u00a0<ref> for details on this distribution). We then fine-tune a pretrained GPT-3 model on this data using supervised learning.\n\n\n\n  \nStep 2: Collect comparison data, and train a reward model. We collect a dataset of comparisons between model outputs, where labelers indicate which output they prefer for a given input. We then train a reward model to predict the human-preferred output.\n\n\n\n  \nStep 3: Optimize a policy against the reward model using PPO. We use the output of the RM as a scalar reward. We fine-tune the supervised policy to optimize this reward using the PPO algorithm\u00a0<cit.>.\n\nSteps 2 and 3 can be iterated continuously; more comparison data is collected on the current best policy, which is used to train a new RM and then a new policy. In practice, most of our comparison data comes from our supervised policies, with some coming from our PPO policies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Dataset\n\n\n\nOur prompt dataset consists primarily of text prompts submitted to the OpenAI\u00a0API, specifically those using an earlier version of the InstructGPT models (trained via supervised learning on a subset of our demonstration data) on the Playground interface.[This is an interface hosted by OpenAI to interact directly with models on our API; see <https://beta.openai.com/playground>.] \nCustomers using the Playground were informed that their data could be used to train further models via a recurring notification any time InstructGPT models were used.\nIn this paper we do not use data from customers using the API in production. We heuristically deduplicate prompts by checking for prompts that share a long common prefix, and we limit the number of prompts to 200 per user ID.  We also create our train, validation, and test splits based on user ID, so that the validation and test sets contain no data from users whose data is in the training set.  To avoid the models learning potentially sensitive customer details, we filter all prompts in the training split for personally identifiable information\u00a0(PII).\n\nTo train the very first InstructGPT models, we asked labelers to write prompts themselves. This is because we needed an initial source of instruction-like prompts to bootstrap the process, and these kinds of prompts weren't often submitted to the regular GPT-3 models on the API. We asked labelers to write three kinds of prompts:\n\n    \n  * Plain:  We simply ask the labelers to come up with an arbitrary task, while ensuring the tasks had sufficient diversity.\n\n  * Few-shot:  We ask the labelers to come up with an instruction, and multiple query/response pairs for that instruction.  \n\n  * User-based:  We had a number of use-cases stated in waitlist applications to the OpenAI API.  We asked labelers to come up with prompts corresponding to these use cases. \n\n\n\n\nFrom these prompts, we produce three different datasets used in our fine-tuning procedure: (1) our SFT dataset, with labeler demonstrations used to train our SFT models, (2) our RM dataset, with labeler rankings of model outputs used to train our RMs, and (3) our PPO dataset, without any human labels, which are used as inputs for RLHF fine-tuning. The SFT dataset contains about 13k training prompts (from the API and labeler-written), the RM dataset has 33k training prompts (from the API and labeler-written), and the PPO dataset has 31k training prompts (only from the API). More details on dataset sizes are provided in Table\u00a0<ref>. \n\nTo give a sense of the composition of our dataset, in Table\u00a0<ref> we show the distribution of use-case categories for our API prompts (specifically the RM dataset) as labeled by our contractors. Most of the use-cases have are generative, rather than classification or QA. We also show some illustrative prompts (written by researchers to mimic the kinds of prompts submitted to InstructGPT models) in Table\u00a0<ref>; more prompts submitted to InstructGPT models are shown in Appendix\u00a0<ref>, and prompts submitted to GPT-3 models are shown in Appendix\u00a0<ref>.\nWe provide more details about our dataset in Appendix\u00a0<ref>.\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Tasks\n\n\n\nOur training tasks are from two sources: (1) a dataset of prompts written by our labelers and (2) a dataset of prompts submitted to early InstructGPT models on our API\u00a0(see Table\u00a0<ref>). These prompts are very diverse and include generation, question answering, dialog, summarization, extractions, and other natural language tasks\u00a0(see Table\u00a0<ref>). Our dataset is over 96% English, however in Section\u00a0<ref> we also probe our model's ability to respond to instructions in other languages and complete coding tasks.\n\nFor each natural language prompt, the task is most often specified directly through a natural language instruction\u00a0(e.g. \u201cWrite a story about a wise frog\u201d), but could also be indirectly through either few-shot examples\u00a0(e.g. giving two examples of frog stories, and prompting the model to generate a new one) or implicit continuation\u00a0(e.g. providing the start of a story about a frog). In each case, we ask our labelers to do their best to infer the intent of the user who wrote the prompt, and ask them to skip inputs where the task is very unclear. Moreover, our labelers also take into account the implicit intentions such as truthfulness of the response, and potentially harmful outputs such as biased or toxic language, guided by the instructions we provide them\u00a0(see Appendix\u00a0<ref>) and their best judgment.\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Human data collection\n\n\n\nTo produce our demonstration and comparison data, and to conduct our main evaluations, we hired a team of about 40 contractors on Upwork and through ScaleAI. Compared to earlier work that collects human preference data on the task of summarization\u00a0<cit.>, our inputs span a much broader range of tasks, and can occasionally include controversial and sensitive topics. Our aim was to select a group of labelers who were sensitive to the preferences of different demographic groups, and who were good at identifying outputs that were potentially harmful. Thus, we conducted a screening test designed to measure labeler performance on these axes. We selected labelers who performed well on this test; for more information about our selection procedure and labeler demographics, see Appendix\u00a0<ref>. \n\nDuring training and evaluation, our alignment criteria may come into conflict: for example, when a user requests a potentially harmful response. During training we prioritize helpfulness to the user (not doing so requires making some difficult design decisions that we leave to future work; see Section\u00a0<ref> for more discussion). However, in our final evaluations we asked labelers prioritize truthfulness and harmlessness (since this is what we really care about). \n\nAs in <cit.>, we collaborate closely with labelers over the course of the project. We have an onboarding process to train labelers on the project, write detailed instructions for each task (see Appendix\u00a0<ref>), and answer labeler questions in a shared chat room.\n\nAs an initial study to see how well our model generalizes to the preferences of other labelers, we hire a separate set of labelers who do not produce any of the training data. These labelers are sourced from the same vendors, but do not undergo a screening test. \n\nDespite the complexity of the task, we find that inter-annotator agreement rates are quite high: training labelers agree with each-other 72.6 \u00b1 1.5% of the time, while for held-out labelers this number is 77.3 \u00b1 1.3%. For comparison, in the summarization work of <cit.> researcher-researcher agreement was 73 \u00b1 4%.\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Models\n\n\n\nWe start with the GPT-3 pretrained language models from <cit.>. These models are trained on a broad distribution of Internet data and are adaptable to a wide range of downstream tasks, but have poorly characterized behavior. Starting from these models, we then train models with three different techniques:\n\n\n\n  \nSupervised fine-tuning (SFT). We fine-tune GPT-3 on our labeler demonstrations using supervised learning.  We trained for 16 epochs, using a cosine learning rate decay, and residual dropout of 0.2. We do our final SFT model selection based on the RM score on the validation set. Similarly to <cit.>, we find that our SFT models overfit on validation loss after 1 epoch; however, we find that training for more epochs helps both the RM score and human preference ratings, despite this overfitting.\n\n\n\n\n  \nReward modeling (RM). Starting from the SFT model with the final unembedding layer\nremoved, we trained a model to take in a prompt and response, and output\na scalar reward. In this paper we only use 6B RMs, as this saves a lot of compute, and we found that 175B RM training could be unstable and thus was less suitable to be used as the value function during RL (see Appendix\u00a0<ref> for more details). \n\nIn <cit.>, the RM is trained on a dataset of comparisons between two model outputs on the same input. They use a cross-entropy loss, with the comparisons as labels\u2014the difference in rewards represents the log odds that one response will be preferred to the other by a human labeler.  \n\nIn order to speed up comparison collection, we present labelers with anywhere between K=4 and K=9 responses to rank.  This produces K  2 comparisons for each prompt shown to a labeler.  Since comparisons are very correlated within each labeling task, we found that if we simply shuffle the comparisons into one dataset, a single pass over the dataset caused the reward model to overfit.[That is, if each of the possible K  2 comparisons is treated as a separate data point, then each completion will potentially be used for K-1 separate gradient updates. The model tends to overfit after a single epoch, so repeating data within an epoch also causes it to overfit.]\nInstead, we train on all K  2 comparisons from each prompt as a single batch element.  This is much more computationally efficient because it only requires a single forward pass of the RM for each completion (rather than K  2 forward passes for K completions) and, because it no longer overfits, it achieves much improved validation accuracy and log loss.\n\nSpecifically, the loss function for the reward model is:\n\n\n    loss(\u03b8)=-1/K  2E_(x, y_w, y_l) \u223c D[log(\u03c3(r_\u03b8(x, y_w)-r_\u03b8(x, y_l)))]\n\n\nwhere r_\u03b8(x, y) is the scalar output of the reward model for prompt x and completion y with parameters \u03b8, y_w is the preferred completion out of the pair of y_w and y_l, and D is the dataset of human comparisons.\n\nFinally, since the RM loss is invariant to shifts in reward, we normalize the reward model using a bias so that the labeler demonstrations achieve a mean score of 0 before doing RL.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nReinforcement learning (RL). Once again following <cit.>, we fine-tuned the SFT model on our environment using PPO\u00a0<cit.>. The environment\nis a bandit environment which presents a random customer prompt and expects a response to the prompt.  Given the prompt and response, it produces a reward determined by the reward model and ends the episode.  In addition, we add a per-token KL penalty from the SFT model at each token to mitigate over-optimization of the reward model.  The value function is initialized from the RM. We call these models \u201cPPO.\u201d\n\nWe also experiment with mixing the pretraining gradients into the PPO gradients, in order to fix the performance regressions on public NLP datasets. We call these models \u201cPPO-ptx.\u201d  We maximize the following combined objective function in RL training:\n\n\n    objective(\u03d5)=     E_(x, y) \u223c D_\u03c0_\u03d5^RL[r_\u03b8(x, y)-\u03b2log(\u03c0_\u03d5^RL(y | x) / \u03c0^SFT(y | x))] + \n       \u03b3 E_x \u223c D_pretrain[log(\u03c0_\u03d5^RL(x))]\n\n\nwhere \u03c0_\u03d5^RL is the learned RL policy, \u03c0^SFT is the supervised trained model, and D_pretrain is the pretraining distribution. The KL reward coefficient, \u03b2, and the pretraining loss coefficient, \u03b3, control the strength of the KL penalty and pretraining gradients respectively. For \"PPO\" models, \u03b3 is set to 0. Unless otherwise specified, in this paper InstructGPT refers to the PPO-ptx models.\n\n\n\n  \nBaselines. We compare the performance of our PPO models to our SFT models and GPT-3. We also compare to GPT-3 when it is provided a few-shot prefix to \u2018prompt' it into an instruction-following mode (GPT-3-prompted). This prefix is prepended to the user-specified instruction.[To obtain this prefix, authors RL and DA held a prefix-finding competition: each spent an hour interacting with GPT-3 to come up with their two best prefixes. The winning prefix was the one that led GPT-3 to attain the highest RM score on the prompt validation set. DA won.]\n\nWe additionally compare InstructGPT to fine-tuning 175B GPT-3 on the FLAN\u00a0<cit.> and T0\u00a0<cit.> datasets, which both consist of a variety of NLP tasks, combined with natural language instructions for each task (the datasets differ in the NLP datasets included, and the style of instructions used). \nWe fine-tune them on approximately 1\u00a0million examples respectively and choose the checkpoint which obtains the highest reward model score on the validation set. See Appendix\u00a0<ref> for more training details.\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Evaluation\n\n\n\nTo evaluate how \u201caligned\u201d our models are, we first need to clarify what alignment means in this context. The definition of alignment has historically been a vague and confusing topic, with various competing proposals\u00a0<cit.>. Following <cit.>, our aim is to train models that act in accordance with user intentions. More practically, for the purpose of our language tasks, we use a framework similar to <cit.>, who define models to be aligned if they are helpful, honest, and harmless.\n\nTo be helpful, the model should follow instructions, but also infer intention from a few-shot prompt or another interpretable pattern such as \u201c\u201d. Since a given prompt's intention can be unclear or ambiguous, we rely on judgment from our labelers, and our main metric is labeler preference ratings. However, since our labelers are not the users who generated the prompts, there could be a divergence between what a user actually intended and what the labeler thought was intended from only reading the prompt.\n\nIt is unclear how to measure honesty in purely generative models; this requires comparing the model's actual output to its \u201cbelief\u201d about the correct output, and since the model is a big black box, we can't infer its beliefs. Instead, we measure truthfulness\u2014whether the model's statements about the world are true\u2014using two metrics: (1) evaluating our model's tendency to make up information on closed domain tasks (\u201challucinations\u201d), and (2) using the TruthfulQA dataset\u00a0<cit.>. Needless to say, this only captures a small part of what is actually meant by truthfulness.\n\nSimilarly to honesty, measuring the harms of language models also poses many challenges. In most cases, the harms from language models depend on how their outputs are used in the real world. For instance, a model generating toxic outputs could be harmful in the context of a deployed chatbot, but might even be helpful if used for data augmentation to train a more accurate toxicity detection model. Earlier in the project, we had labelers evaluate whether an output was \u2018potentially harmful'. However, we discontinued this as it required too much speculation about how the outputs would ultimately be used; especially since our data also comes from customers who interact with the Playground API interface (rather than from production use cases).\n\nTherefore we use a suite of more specific proxy criteria that aim to capture different aspects of behavior in a deployed model that could end up being harmful: we have labelers evaluate whether an output is inappropriate in the context of a customer assistant, denigrates a protected class, or contains sexual or violent content. We also benchmark our model on datasets intended to measure bias and toxicity, such as RealToxicityPrompts\u00a0<cit.> and CrowS-Pairs\u00a0<cit.>.\n\nTo summarize, we can divide our quantitative evaluations into two separate parts:\n\n\n\n  \nEvaluations on API distribution. Our main metric is human preference ratings on a held out set of prompts from the same source as our training distribution. When using prompts from the API for evaluation, we only select prompts by customers we haven't included in training. However, given that our training prompts are designed to be used with InstructGPT models, it's likely that they disadvantage the GPT-3 baselines. Thus, we also evaluate on prompts submitted to GPT-3 models on the API; these prompts are generally not in an `instruction following' style, but are designed specifically for GPT-3. In both cases, for each model we calculate how often its outputs are preferred to a baseline policy; we choose our 175B SFT model as the baseline since its performance is near the middle of the pack. Additionally, we ask labelers to judge the overall quality of each response on a 1-7 Likert scale and collect a range of metadata for each model output\u00a0(see Table <ref>).\n\n\n\n  \nEvaluations on public NLP datasets. We evaluate on two types of public datasets: those that capture an aspect of language model safety, particularly truthfulness, toxicity, and bias, and those that capture zero-shot performance on traditional NLP tasks like question answering, reading comprehension, and summarization. We also conduct human evaluations of toxicity on the RealToxicityPrompts dataset\u00a0<cit.>. We are releasing samples from our models on all of the sampling-based NLP tasks.[Accessible here: <https://github.com/openai/following-instructions-human-feedback>.]In this section, we provide experimental evidence for our claims in Section\u00a0<ref>, sorted into three parts: results on the API prompt distribution, results on public NLP datasets, and qualitative results.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Results on the API distribution\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nLabelers significantly prefer InstructGPT outputs over outputs from GPT-3. On our test set of prompts, our labelers significantly prefer InstructGPT outputs across model sizes. These results are shown in Figure\u00a0<ref>. We find that GPT-3 outputs perform the worst, and one can obtain significant step-size improvements by using a well-crafted few-shot prompt (GPT-3 (prompted)), then by training on demonstrations using supervised learning (SFT), and finally by training on comparison data using PPO. Adding updates on the pretraining mix during PPO does not lead to large changes in labeler preference. To illustrate the magnitude of our gains: when compared directly, 175B InstructGPT outputs are preferred to GPT-3 outputs 85 \u00b1 3% of the time, and preferred 71 \u00b1 4% of the time to few-shot GPT-3.\n\nWe also found that our results do not change significantly when evaluated on prompts submitted to GPT-3 models on the API (see Figure\u00a0<ref>), though our PPO-ptx models perform slightly worse at larger model sizes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Figure\u00a0<ref> we show that labelers also rate InstructGPT outputs favorably along several more concrete axes. Specifically, compared to GPT-3, InstructGPT outputs are more appropriate in the context of a customer assistant, more often follow explicit constraints defined in the instruction\u00a0(e.g. \u201cWrite your answer in 2 paragraphs or less.\u201d), are less likely to fail to follow the correct instruction entirely, and make up facts (`hallucinate') less often in closed-domain tasks. \nThese results suggest that InstructGPT models are more reliable and easier to control than GPT-3.\nWe've found that our other metadata categories occur too infrequently in our API to obtain statistically significant differences between our models. \n\n\n\n  \nOur models generalize to the preferences of \"held-out\" labelers that did not produce any training data. Held-out labelers have similar ranking preferences as workers who we used to produce training data (see Figure\u00a0<ref>). In particular, according to held-out workers, all of our InstructGPT models still greatly outperform the GPT-3 baselines. Thus, our InstructGPT models aren't simply overfitting to the preferences of our training labelers.\n\nWe see further evidence of this from the generalization capabilities of our reward models. We ran an experiment where we split our labelers into 5 groups,\nand train 5 RMs (with 3 different seeds) using 5-fold cross validation (training on 4 of the groups, and evaluating on the held-out group).\nThese RMs have an accuracy of 69.6 \u00b1 0.9% on predicting the preferences of labelers in the held-out group, a small decrease from their 72.4 \u00b1 0.4% accuracy on predicting the preferences of labelers in their training set.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nPublic NLP datasets are not reflective of how our language models are used. In Figure\u00a0<ref>, we also compare InstructGPT to our 175B GPT-3 baselines fine-tuned on the FLAN\u00a0<cit.> and T0\u00a0<cit.> datasets (see Appendix\u00a0<ref> for details). We find that these models perform better than GPT-3, on par with GPT-3 with a well-chosen prompt, and worse than our SFT baseline. This indicates that these datasets are not sufficiently diverse to improve performance on our API prompt distribution. In a head to head comparison, our 175B InstructGPT model outputs were preferred over our FLAN model 78 \u00b14% of the time and over our T0 model 79 \u00b1 4% of the time. Likert scores for these models are shown in Figure\u00a0<ref>.\n\nWe believe our InstructGPT model outperforms FLAN and T0 for two reasons. First, public NLP datasets are designed to capture tasks that are easy to evaluate with automatic metrics, such as classification, question answering, and to a certain extent summarization and translation. However, classification and QA are only a small part\u00a0(about 18%) of what API customers use our language models for, whereas open-ended generation and brainstorming consist of about 57% of our prompt dataset according to labelers\u00a0(see Table\u00a0<ref>). Second, it can be difficult for public NLP datasets to obtain a very high diversity of inputs (at least, on the kinds of inputs that real-world users would be interested in using).\nOf course, tasks found in NLP datasets do represent a kind of instruction that we would like language models to be able to solve, so the broadest type instruction-following model would combine both types of datasets.\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Results on public NLP datasets\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nInstructGPT models show improvements in truthfulness over GPT-3. As measured by human evaluatoins on the TruthfulQA dataset, our PPO models show small but significant improvements in generating truthful and informative outputs compared to GPT-3 (see Figure\u00a0<ref>). This behavior is the default: our models do not have to be specifically instructed to tell the truth to exhibit improved truthfulness. Interestingly, the exception is our 1.3B PPO-ptx model, which performs slightly worse than a GPT-3 model of the same size. When evaluated only on prompts that were not adversarially selected against GPT-3, our PPO models are still significantly more truthful and informative than GPT-3 (although the absolute improvement decreases by a couple of percentage points. \n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing <cit.>, we also give a helpful \u201cInstruction+QA\u201d prompt that instructs the model to respond with \u201cI have no comment\u201d when it is not certain of the correct answer. In this case, our PPO models err on the side of being truthful and uninformative rather than confidently saying a falsehood; the baseline GPT-3 model aren't as good at this. \n\n\nOur improvements in truthfulness are also evidenced by the fact that our PPO models hallucinate\u00a0(i.e. fabricate information) less often on closed-domain tasks from our API distribution, which we've shown in Figure\u00a0<ref>.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nInstructGPT shows small improvements in toxicity over GPT-3, but not bias. We first evaluate our models on the RealToxicityPrompts dataset\u00a0<cit.>. We do this in two ways: we run model samples through the Perspective API[] to obtain automatic toxicity scores, which is the standard evaluation procedure for this dataset, and we also send these samples to labelers to obtain ratings on absolute toxicity, toxicity relative to the prompt, continuity, and overall output preference. We sample prompts from this dataset uniformly according to prompt toxicity to better assess how our models perform with high input toxicity (see Figure\u00a0<ref> in Appendix\u00a0<ref>); this differs from the standard prompt sampling for this dataset, and thus our absolute toxicity numbers are inflated. \n\n\n\nOur results are in Figure\u00a0<ref>. We find that, when instructed to produce a safe and respectful output (\u201crespectful prompt\u201d), InstructGPT models generate less toxic outputs than those from GPT-3 according to the Perspective API. This advantage disappears when the respectful prompt is removed (\u201cno prompt\u201d). Interestingly, when explicitly prompted to produce a toxic output, InstructGPT outputs are much more toxic than those from GPT-3 (see Figure\u00a0<ref>).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese results are confirmed in our human evaluations: InstructGPT is less toxic than GPT-3 in the \u201crespectful prompt\u201d setting, but performs similarly in the \u201cno prompt\u201d setting. We provide extended results in Appendix\u00a0<ref>. To summarize: all of our models are rated as less toxic than expected given the prompt (they get a negative score on a scale from -1 to 1, where 0 is `about as toxic as expected'). Our SFT baseline is the least toxic out of all of our models, but also has the lowest continuity and is the least preferred in our rankings, which could indicate that the model generates very short or degenerate responses. \n\nTo evaluate the model's propensity to generate biased speech (see Appendix\u00a0<ref>), we also evaluated InstructGPT on modified versions of the Winogender\u00a0<cit.> and CrowS-Pairs\u00a0<cit.> datasets.\nThese datasets consists of pairs of sentences which can highlight potential bias. We calculate the relative probabilities of producing the sentences in each pair and the entropy (in bits) of the associated binary probability distributions. Perfectly unbiased models will have no preference between the sentences in each pair and will therefore have maximum entropy. By this metric, our models are not less biased than GPT-3. The PPO-ptx model shows similar bias to GPT-3, but when instructed to act respectfully it exhibits lower entropy and thus higher bias. The pattern of the bias is not clear; it appears that the instructed models are more certain of their outputs regardless of whether or not their outputs exhibit stereotypical behavior.\n\n\n\n\n  \nWe can minimize performance regressions on public NLP datasets by modifying our RLHF fine-tuning procedure. By default, when we train a PPO model on our API distribution, it suffers from an \u201calignment tax\u201d, as its performance on several public NLP datasets decreases.  We want an alignment procedure that avoids an alignment tax, because it incentivizes the use of models that are unaligned but more capable on these tasks.\n\nIn Figure\u00a0<ref> we show that adding pretraining updates to our PPO fine-tuning (PPO-ptx) mitigates these performance regressions on all datasets, and even surpasses GPT-3 on HellaSwag. The performance of the PPO-ptx model still lags behind GPT-3 on DROP, SQuADv2, and translation; more work is needed to study and further eliminate these performance regressions. \n\nMixing in pretraining updates performs better than the simpler solution of increasing the KL coefficient. In Figure\u00a0<ref>, we show that there is a value of the pretraining mix coefficient that both reverses the performance regressions on SQuADv2 and DROP (the datasets we used for testing), and has minimal reductions in validation reward. In contrast, increasing the KL coefficient (Figure\u00a0<ref>) leads to significant decreases in validation reward and never fully recovers on DROP and SQuAD. Changing the KL model from the PPO init to GPT-3 gives similar results. \n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Qualitative results\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nInstructGPT models show promising generalization to instructions outside of the RLHF fine-tuning distribution. In particular, we find that InstructGPT shows ability to follow instructions in non-English languages, and perform summarization and question-answering for code. This is interesting because non-English languages and code form a tiny minority of our fine-tuning data,[We generally instruct our labelers to skip evaluations where they are missing the required expertise, though sometimes labelers use a translation service to evaluate simple instructions in languages that they do not speak. ] and it suggests that, in some cases, alignment methods could generalize to producing the desired behavior on inputs that humans did not directly supervise.\n\nWe do not track these behaviors quantitatively, but we show some qualitative examples in Figure\u00a0<ref>. Our 175B PPO-ptx model is able to reliably answers questions about code, and can also follow instructions in other languages; however, we notice that it often produces an output in English even when the instruction is in another language. In comparison, we find that GPT-3 can perform these tasks but requires more careful prompting, and rarely follows instructions in these domains.\n\n\n\n  \nInstructGPT still makes simple mistakes. In interacting with our 175B PPO-ptx model, we have noticed it can still make simple mistakes, despite its strong performance on many different language tasks. To give a few examples: (1) when given an instruction with a false premise, the model sometimes incorrectly assumes the premise is true, (2) the model can overly hedge; when given a simple question, it can sometimes say that there is no one answer to the question and give multiple possible answers, even when there is one fairly clear answer from the context, and (3) the model's performance degrades when instructions contain multiple explicit constraints\u00a0(e.g. \u201clist 10 movies made in the 1930's set in France\u201d) or when constraints can be challenging for language models\u00a0(e.g. writing a summary in a specified number of sentences).\n\nWe show some examples of these behaviors in Figure\u00a0<ref>. We suspect that behavior (2) emerges partly because we instruct labelers to reward epistemic humility; thus, they may tend to reward outputs that hedge, and this gets picked up by our reward model. We suspect that behavior (1) occurs because there are few prompts in the training set that assume false premises, and our models don't generalize well to these examples. We believe both these behaviors could be dramatically reduced with adversarial data collection\u00a0<cit.>.\u00a7.\u00a7 Implications for alignment research\n\n\n\nThis research is part of our broader research program to align AI systems with human intentions\u00a0<cit.>. Even though this work focuses on our current language model systems, we seek general and scalable methods that work for future AI systems\u00a0<cit.>. The systems we work with here are still fairly limited, but they are among the largest language models today and we apply them on a wide range of language tasks, including classification, summarization, question-answering, creative writing, dialogue, and others.\n\n Our approach to alignment research in this work is iterative: we are improving the alignment of current AI systems instead of focusing abstractly on aligning AI systems that don't yet exist. A disadvantage of this approach is that we are not directly facing alignment problems that occur only when aligning superhuman systems\u00a0<cit.>. However, our approach does provides us with a clear empirical feedback loop of what works and what does not. We believe that this feedback loop is essential to refine our alignment techniques, and it forces us to keep pace with progress in machine learning. Moreover, the alignment technique we use here, RLHF, is an important building block in several proposals to align superhuman systems\u00a0<cit.>. For example, RLHF was a central method in recent work on summarizing books, a task that exhibits some of the difficulties of aligning superhuman AI systems as it is difficult for humans to evaluate directly\u00a0<cit.>.\n\nFrom this work, we can draw lessons for alignment research more generally:\n\n\n\n  * The cost of increasing model alignment is modest relative to pretraining. The cost of collecting our data and the compute for training runs, including experimental runs is a fraction of what was spent to train GPT-3: training our 175B SFT model requires 4.9 petaflops/s-days and training our 175B PPO-ptx model requires 60 petaflops/s-days, compared to 3,640 petaflops/s-days for GPT-3\u00a0<cit.>. At the same time, our results show that RLHF is very effective at making language models more helpful to users, more so than a 100x model size increase. This suggests that right now increasing investments in alignment of existing language models is more cost-effective than training larger models\u2014at least for our customers' natural language task distribution.\n\n  * We've seen some evidence that InstructGPT generalizes `following instructions' to settings that we don't supervise it in, for example on non-English language tasks and code-related tasks. This is an important property because it's prohibitively expensive to have humans supervise models on every task they perform. More research is needed to study how well this generalization scales with increased capabilities; see <cit.> for recent research in this direction. \n\n  * We were able to mitigate most of the performance degradations introduced by our fine-tuning. If this was not the case, these performance degradations would constitute an alignment tax\u2014an additional cost for aligning the model. Any technique with a high tax might not see adoption. To avoid incentives for future highly capable AI systems to remain unaligned with human intent, there is a need for alignment techniques that have low alignment tax. To this end, our results are good news for RLHF as a low-tax alignment technique.\n\n  * We've validated alignment techniques from research in the real world. Alignment research has historically been rather abstract, focusing on either theoretical results\u00a0<cit.>, small synthetic domains\u00a0<cit.>, or training ML models on public NLP datasets\u00a0<cit.>. Our work provides grounding for alignment research in AI systems that are being used in production in the real world with customers.[Note that while fine-tuning models using human data is common practice when deploying ML systems, the purpose of these efforts is to obtain a model that performs well on a company's specific use case, rather than advancing the alignment of general-purpose ML models. ] This enables an important feedback loop on the techniques' effectiveness and limitations.\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Who are we aligning to?\n\n\n\nWhen aligning language models with human intentions, their end behavior is a function of the underlying model\u00a0(and its training data), the fine-tuning data, and the alignment method used. In this section, we describe a number of factors that influence the fine-tuning data specifically, to ultimately determine what and who we're aligning to. We then consider areas for improvement before a larger discussion of the limitations of our work in Section\u00a0<ref>.\n\nThe literature often frames alignment using such terms as \u201chuman preferences\u201d or \u201chuman values.\u201d In this work, we have aligned to a set of labelers' preferences that were influenced, among others things, by the instructions they were given, the context in which they received them\u00a0(as a paid job), and who they received them from. Some crucial caveats apply:\n\nFirst, we are aligning to demonstrations and preferences provided by our training labelers, who directly produce the data that we use to fine-tune our models. We describe our labeler hiring process and demographics in Appendix\u00a0<ref>; in general, they are mostly English-speaking people living in the United States or Southeast Asia hired via Upwork or Scale AI. They disagree with each other on many examples; we found the inter-labeler agreement to be about 73%. \n\nSecond, we are aligning to our preferences, as the researchers designing this study\u00a0(and thus by proxy to our broader research organization, OpenAI): we write the labeling instructions that labelers use as a guide when writing demonstrations and choosing their preferred output, and we answer their questions about edge cases in a shared chat room. More study is needed on the exact effect of different instruction sets and interface designs on the data collected from labelers and its ultimate effect on model behavior.\n\nThird, our training data is determined by prompts sent by OpenAI customers to models on the OpenAI\u00a0API Playground, and thus we are implicitly aligning to what customers think is valuable and, in some cases, what their end-users think is valuable to currently use the API for. Customers and their end users may disagree or customers may not be optimizing for end users' well-being; for example, a customer may want a model that maximizes the amount of time a user spends on their platform, which is not necessarily what end-users want. In practice, our labelers don't have visibility into the contexts in which a given prompt or completion will be seen.\n\nFourth, OpenAI's customers are not representative of all potential or current users of language models\u2014let alone of all individuals and groups impacted by language model use. For most of the duration of this project, users of the OpenAI API were selected off of a waitlist. The initial seeds for this waitlist were OpenAI employees, biasing the ultimate group toward our own networks.\n\nStepping back, there are many difficulties in designing an alignment process that is fair, transparent, and has suitable accountability mechanisms in place. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate that this alignment technique can align to an specific human reference group for a specific application. We are not claiming that researchers, the labelers we hired, or our API customers are the right source of preferences. There are many stakeholders to consider\u2014the organization training the model, the customers using the model to develop products, the end users of these products, and the broader population who may be directly or indirectly affected. It is not only a matter of making the alignment process more participatory; it is impossible that one can train a system that is aligned to everyone's preferences at once, or where everyone would endorse the tradeoffs.\n\nOne path forward could be to train models that can be conditioned on the preferences of certain groups, or that can be easily fine-tuned or prompted to represent different groups. Different models can then be deployed and used by groups who endorse different values. However, these models might still end up affecting broader society and there are a lot of difficult decisions to be made relating to whose preferences to condition on, and how to ensure that all groups can be represented and can opt out of processes that may be harmful.\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Limitations\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nMethodology.  The behavior of our InstructGPT models is determined in part by the human feedback obtained from our contractors. Some of the labeling tasks rely on value judgments that may be impacted by the identity of our contractors, their beliefs, cultural backgrounds, and personal history. We hired about 40 contractors, guided by their performance on a screening test meant to judge how well they could identify and respond to sensitive prompts, and their agreement rate with researchers on a labeling task with detailed instructions (see Appendix\u00a0<ref>). We kept our team of contractors small because this facilitates high-bandwidth communication with a smaller set of contractors who are doing the task full-time. However, this group is clearly not representative of the full spectrum of people who will use and be affected by our deployed models. As a simple example, our labelers are primarily English-speaking and our data consists almost entirely of English instructions. \n\nThere are also many ways in which we could improve our data collection set-up. For instance, most comparisons are only labeled by 1 contractor for cost reasons. Having examples labeled multiple times could help identify areas where our contractors disagree, and thus where a single model is unlikely to align to all of them. In cases of disagreement, aligning to the average labeler preference may not be desirable. For example, when generating text that disproportionately affects a minority group, we may want the preferences of labelers belonging to that group to be weighted more heavily.\n\n\n\n  \nModels.  Our models are neither fully aligned nor fully safe; they still generate toxic or biased outputs, make up facts, and generate sexual and violent content without explicit prompting. They can also fail to generate reasonable outputs on some inputs; we show some examples of this in Figure\u00a0<ref>.\n\nPerhaps the greatest limitation of our models is that, in most cases, they follow the user's instruction, even if that could lead to harm in the real world.  For example, when given a prompt instructing the models to be maximally biased, InstructGPT generates more toxic outputs than equivalently-sized GPT-3 models. We discuss potential mitigations in the following sections. \n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Open questions\n\n\n\nThis work is a first step towards using alignment techniques to fine-tune language models to follow a wide range of instructions. There are many open questions to explore to further align language model behavior with what people actually want them to do. \n\nMany methods could be tried to further decrease the models' propensity to generate toxic, biased, or otherwise harmful outputs. For example, one could use an adversarial set-up where labelers find the worst-case behaviors of the model, which are then labeled and added to the dataset\u00a0<cit.>. One could also combine our method with ways of filtering the pretraining data\u00a0<cit.>, either for training the initial pretrained models, or for the data we use for our pretraining mix approach. Similarly, one could combine our approach with methods that improve models' truthfulness, such as WebGPT\u00a0<cit.>.\n\nIn this work, if the user requests a potentially harmful or dishonest response, we allow our model to generate these outputs. Training our model to be harmless despite user instructions is important, but is also difficult because whether an output is harmful depends on the context in which it's deployed; for example, it may be beneficial to use language models to generate toxic outputs as part of a data augmentation pipeline. Our techniques can also be applied to making models refuse certain user instructions, and we plan to explore this in subsequent iterations of this research. \n\nGetting models to do what we want is directly related to the steerability and controllability literature\u00a0<cit.>. A promising future path is combining RLHF with other methods of steerability, for example using control codes\u00a0<cit.>, or modifying the sampling procedure at inference time using a smaller model\u00a0<cit.>.\n\nWhile we mainly focus on RLHF, there are many other algorithms that could be used to train policies on our demonstration and comparison data to get even better results. For example, one could explore expert iteration\u00a0<cit.>, or simpler behavior cloning methods that use a subset of the comparison data. One could also try constrained optimization approaches\u00a0<cit.> that maximize the score from a reward model conditioned on generating a small number of harmful behaviors.\n\nComparisons are also not necessarily the most efficient way of providing an alignment signal. For example, we could have labelers edit model responses to make them better, or generate critiques of model responses in natural language. There is also a vast space of options for designing interfaces for labelers to provide feedback to language models; this is an interesting human-computer interaction problem.\n\nOur proposal for mitigating the alignment tax, by incorporating pretraining data into RLHF fine-tuning, does not completely mitigate performance regressions, and may make certain undesirable behaviors more likely for some tasks (if these behaviors are present in the pretraining data). This is an interesting area for further research. Another modification that would likely improve our method is to filter the pretraining mix data for toxic content\u00a0<cit.>, or augment this data with synthetic instructions.\n\nAs discussed in detail in <cit.>, there are subtle differences between aligning to instructions, intentions, revealed preferences, ideal preferences, interests, and values. <cit.> advocate for a principle-based approach to alignment: in other words, for identifying \u201cfair principles for alignment that receive reflective endorsement despite widespread\nvariation in people's moral beliefs.\u201d In our paper we align to the inferred user intention for simplicity, but more research is required in this area.\nIndeed, one of the biggest open questions is how to design an alignment process that is transparent, that meaningfully represents the people impacted by the technology, and that synthesizes peoples' values in a way that achieves broad consensus amongst many groups. We discuss some related considerations in Section\u00a0<ref>.\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Broader impacts\n\n\n\nThis work is motivated by our aim to increase the positive impact of large language models by training them to do what a given set of humans want them to do. By default, language models optimize the next word prediction objective, which is only a proxy for what we want these models to do. Our results indicate that our techniques hold promise for making language models more helpful, truthful, and harmless. In the longer term, alignment failures could lead to more severe consequences, particularly if these models are deployed in safety-critical situations. We expect that as model scaling continues, greater care has to be taken to ensure that they are aligned with human intentions\u00a0<cit.>.\n\nHowever, making language models better at following user intentions also makes them easier to misuse. It may be easier to use these models to generate convincing misinformation, or hateful or abusive content. \n\nAlignment techniques are not a panacea for resolving safety issues associated with large language models; rather, they should be used as one tool in a broader safety ecosystem.  Aside from intentional misuse, there are many domains where large language models should be deployed only with great care, or not at all. Examples include high-stakes domains such as medical diagnoses, classifying people based on protected characteristics, determining eligibility for credit, employment, or housing, generating political advertisements, and law enforcement. If these models are open-sourced, it becomes challenging to limit harmful applications in these and other domains without proper regulation. On the other hand, if large language model access is restricted to a few organizations with the resources required to train them, this excludes most people from access to cutting-edge ML technology. Another option is for an organization to own the end-to-end infrastructure of model deployment, and make it accessible via an API. This allows for the implementation of safety protocols like use case restriction (only allowing the model to be used for certain applications), monitoring for misuse and revoking access to those who misuse the system, and rate limiting to prevent the generation of large-scale misinformation. However, this can come at the cost of reduced transparency and increased centralization of power because it requires the API provider to make decisions on where to draw the line on each of these questions.\n\nFinally, as discussed in Section\u00a0<ref>, the question of who these models are aligned to is extremely important, and will significantly affect whether the net impact of these models is positive or negative.\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Acknowledgements\n\n\nFirst, we would like to thank  Lilian Weng, Jason Kwon, Boris Power, Che Chang, Josh Achiam, Steven Adler, Gretchen Krueger, Miles Brundage, Tyna Eloundou, Gillian Hadfield, Irene Soliaman, Christy Dennison, Daniel Ziegler, William Saunders, Beth Barnes, Cathy Yeh, Nick Cammaratta, Jonathan Ward, Matt Knight, Pranav Shyam, Alec Radford, and others at OpenAI for discussions throughout the course of the project that helped shape our research direction.

However, this strategy only works once you have a model that accepts instruction-like prompts.  In order to train the very first such model, we asked contractors to write prompts themselves.  We asked labelers to write three kinds of prompts:\n\n    \n  * Plain:  We simply ask the labelers to come up with an arbitrary task, while ensuring diversity of tasks.\n\n  * Few-shot:  We ask the labelers to come up with an instruction, and multiple query/response pairs for that instruction.  For example, the instruction could be \u201cGive the sentiment for a tweet,\u201d and the queries would be tweets and the responses either \u201cPositive\u201d or \u201cNegative.\u201d  We can then format these as few-shot prompts like those in <cit.>.  With K query-response pairs, we create K training examples using the other K-1 in the context.\n\n  * User-based:  We had a number of use-cases stated in applications to the OpenAI API.  We asked labelers to come up with prompts corresponding to these use cases.\n\n In order to preserve the anonymity of the application information, we had a separate labeler create vague high level tasks based on looking at a list of applications, modifying the task descriptions to eliminate any information that were specific to a given application. This data was used to train the first InstructGPT model via supervised learning, which was deployed in beta in the API in early 2021. \n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 API user prompts\n\n\nFor API prompts, we use prompts submitted by users to the aforementioned earlier version of the InstructGPT model on the OpenAI API Playground. Throughout the paper, we only use data from the Playground, rather than customers using our model in production, as it was easier to get informed consent: every time a user switched to an InstructGPT model, an alert message would pop up stating that prompts submitted to these models could be used to train future versions of our models. We also communicated this in a message on the developer Slack channel upon launching the beta of the InstructGPT models. We filter out prompts from the training split containing personally identifiable information (PII).\n\nTo ensure a diversity of use cases, we heuristically deduplicate prompts by checking for prompts that share a long common prefix, and limited the number of prompts to roughly 200 per organization. In addition, we create train, validation, and test splits based on organization IDs, so that e.g. the validation set contains different use cases than the training set.\n\nWe conceptualized API requests as belonging to one of ten use cases: generation, open QA, closed QA, brainstorming, chat, rewriting, summarization, classification, extraction, or other. Below, we show fictional but realistic prompts from a variety of use cases:\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Illustrative user prompts from InstructGPT distribution\n\n\n\n\np.2 p.8\nUse Case                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Example \n \n\nUse Case                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Example \n 2rContinued on next page \n \n\nbrainstorming                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       List five ideas for how to regain enthusiasm for my career \n brainstorming                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             What are some key points I should know when studying Ancient Greece? \n brainstorming                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        What are 4 questions a user might have after reading the instruction manual for a trash compactor?{user manual}1. \n brainstorming                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            What are 10 science fiction books I should read next? \n classification                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Take the following text and rate, on a scale from 1-10, how sarcastic the person is being (1 = not at all, 10 = extremely sarcastic).

We synthetically constructed multiple SFT datapoints from the same instruction by sampling different sets of few-shot examples.\n\nFor the RM, recall that for every prompt, we collected rankings for K outputs (ranging from 4 to 9) and trained the model on all K  2, so the number of ranked pairs we trained the model on is an order of magnitude larger than the number of prompts.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Data diversity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data that we collect spans a wide range of categories and use cases. Table\u00a0<ref> shows the diversity of categories in our RM training and validation datasets as labeled by our contractors. The distribution of categories for the PPO datasets was similar.\nWe additionally show a subset of our labeled prompt metadata in Table\u00a0<ref>. \nNote that our annotation fields changed over the course of the project, so not every prompt was annotated for every field.   \n\nWe used a lightweight classifier () to classify the language of all instructions in our dataset.\nEmpirically, around 96% of our dataset (110k datapoints) is classified as English, although we estimate that the actual fraction may be 99% or higher, due to classifier inaccuracies.\n\nBesides English, a small minority of prompts were found in at least 20 other languages:\nSpanish, French, German, Portuguese, Italian, Dutch, Romanian, Catalan, Chinese, Japanese, Swedish, Polish, Danish, Turkish, Indonesian, Czech, Norwegian, Korean, Finnish, Hungarian, Hebrew, Russian, Lithuanian, Esperanto, Slovak, Croatian, Swahili, Estonian, Slovenian, Arabic, Thai, Vietnamese, Malayalam, Greek, Albanian, and Tibetan.\n\nTable\u00a0<ref> shows the average number of prompts each customer contributed to the dataset. In Table\u00a0<ref>, we report descriptive statistics for prompt lengths (in tokens) used to train various models, and in Table\u00a0<ref> we  break down token lengths by use case. Finally, we also report lengths of contractor-written demonstrations used for our SFT model in table\u00a0<ref>, both for contractor-written and labeler-written prompts.\u00a7.\u00a7 Labeler selection\n\n\n\nOur labelers consist of contractors hired either through Upwork, or sourced from Scale AI. Unlike previous work on RLHF that focused mostly on the summarization domain\u00a0<cit.>, in this work we want humans to label a broad set of natural language prompts submitted to language models, some of which may be sensitive in nature. Thus, we conducted a screening process to select labelers who showed a high propensity to detect and respond to sensitive content.\n\nMore specifically, from an initial pool of labeler candidates, we selected our training labelers according to the following criteria:\n\n    \n  * Agreement on sensitive speech flagging. We created a dataset of prompts and completions, where some of prompts or completions were sensitive\u00a0(i.e. anything that could elicit strong negative feelings, whether by being toxic, sexual, violent, judgemental, political, etc.). We labeled this data for sensitivity ourselves, and measured agreement between us and labelers.\n    \n  * Agreement on rankings. We take prompts submitted to our API, and several model completions, and have labelers rank the completions by overall quality. We measure their agreement with researcher labels.\n    \n  * Sensitive demonstration writing. We created a small set of sensitive prompts, where responding to the outputs appropriately would require nuance. We then rated each demonstration on a 1-7 Likert scale, and computed an average \u201cdemonstration score\u201d for each labeler.\n    \n  * Self-assessed ability to identify sensitive speech for different groups. We wanted to select a team of labelers that had collectively were able to identify sensitive content in a broad range of areas. For legal reasons, we can't hire contractors based on demographic criteria. Thus, we had labelers answer the question: \u201cFor what topics or cultural groups are you comfortable identifying sensitive speech?\u201d and used this as part of our selection process.\n\n\nAfter collecting this data, we selected the labelers who did well on all of these criteria (we performed selections on an anonymized version of the data). Since the fourth criteria is subjective, we ultimately chose labelers subjectively according to these criteria, though we had soft cutoffs at 75% agreement on sensitive speech flagging and comparisons, and a 6/7 demonstration score. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Labeling instructions\n\n\n\nThe instructions we provided to labelers evolved over the course of the project, as we provided feedback, changed our metadata fields, and developed a better understanding of what we wanted to measure. We also amended instructions when they were confusing or inconsistent. \n\nOf particular note, during the labeling of our training data, we had labelers prioritize helpfulness to the user as the most important criteria (above truthfulness and harmlessness), whereas in our final evaluations we had labelers prioritize truthfulness and harmlessness. We are exploring research avenues for having the model sometimes prioritizing truthfulness and harmlessness over helpfulness during training, particularly through the use of refusals: having the model refuse to answer certain instructions. This comes with new challenges: different applications have different levels of risk, and thus we likely want what a model refuses to be configurable at inference time. Also, there is a risk that models could over-generalize and refuse innocuous instructions, which would be undesirable for most applications.\n\nWe show excerpts of our instructions for our final evaluations on our prompt distribution in Table\u00a0<ref>, and on the RealToxicityPrompts distribution in Table\u00a0<ref>.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Labeler demographic data\n\n\nWe sent a voluntary, anonymous survey to our labelers to better understand their demographics. We show the results from the 19 respondents in Table\u00a0<ref>. Overall, we find that our labelers are quite young (75% less than 35 years old), fairly balanced between male and female genders, and mostly come from the US or Southeast Asia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Labeler satisfaction survey\n\nIn combination with our demographics survey, we also sent out a survey to obtain feedback on the task. We show the results from the 19 respondents in Table\u00a0<ref>. Overall, our labelers enjoyed the task, thought they were paid fairly for their work, and shared that they appreciated the helpfulness and level of communication from the researchers. Some labelers did find the task repetitive, though others felt there was enough variation to keep things interesting and engaging.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Web interface\n\nIn Figure\u00a0<ref>, we show screenshots of our labeling interface, that all of our labelers (and researchers) use to label data.All model architectures use the GPT-3 architecture\u00a0<cit.>. For the reward models and value functions, the unembedding layer of the original model is replaced with a projection layer to output a scalar value. All models use fp16 weights and activations, with fp32 master copies of weights. The same byte pair encodings as in <cit.> are used for all models. All our language models and RL policies have a context length of 2k tokens. We filter out prompts that are longer than 1k tokens and limit the maximum response length to 1k tokens.\n\nAll models are trained with the Adam optimizer, with \u03b2_1=0.9 and \u03b2_2=0.95.\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Details of SFT training\n\nWe train our SFT models for 16 epochs with residual dropout of 0.2. We use a cosine LR schedule down to 10% of the original learning rate, with no learning rate warmup. For our 1.3B and 6B models, we use an LR of 9.65e-6 and a batch size of 32. For 175B, we use a LR of 5.03e-6 and a batch size of 8. To select learning rates, we did a geometric search over 7 LRs for 1.3B and 6B, and 5 LRs for 175B. We also tuned the number of epochs using geometric search. Our final models were selected based on the RM score, which we've found to be more predictive of human preference results compared to validation loss.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Details of RM training\n\n\n\nWe trained a single 6B reward model which we used for all PPO models of all sizes. Larger 175B RMs had the potential to achieve lower validation loss, but (1) their training was more unstable which made them less suitable for use as initializations for the PPO value functions, and (2) using a 175B RM and value function greatly increase the compute requirements of PPO. In preliminary experiments, we found that 6B RMs were stable across a wide range of learning rates, and led to equally strong PPO models.\n\nThe final reward model was initialized from a 6B GPT-3 model that was fine-tuned on a variety of public NLP datasets (ARC, BoolQ, CoQA, DROP, MultiNLI, OpenBookQA, QuAC, RACE, and Winogrande). This was mostly for historical reasons; we find similar results when initializing the RM from the GPT-3 or SFT models. We trained for a single epoch over the full reward model training set (see Table\u00a0<ref>) at a learning rate of , a cosine learning rate schedule (dropping to 10% of its initial value by the end of training), and a batch size of 64. Training did not appear to be very sensitive to the learning rate or schedule; changes of up to 50% in the learning rate resulted in similar performance. Training was quite sensitive to the number of epochs: multiple epochs quickly overfit the model to the training data with obvious deterioration in the validation loss. The batch size here represents the distinct number of prompts per batch. Each prompt had between K=4 and K=9 labeled completions, from which there were up to K  2 possible comparisons. Ties were dropped. Therefore, a single batch could contain up to 64 \u00d7K  2\u2264 2,304 comparisons.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Details of the initialization models for RLHF\n\nWe initialize the RLHF models from a pretrained GPT-3 model and apply supervised fine-tuning for 2 epochs on the demonstration dataset.  We also mix in 10% pretraining data during fine-tuning, since we find it helpful for PPO training (see Appendix\u00a0<ref> for details). Cosine learning rate schedule is used and the learning rate eventually decays to 10% of the peak learning rate. We use a batch size of 32 for 1.3B and 6B models and 8 for the 175B model. We compare a few different peak learning rates for each model and pick the one with low losses on both the demonstration and the pretraining validation datasets. A log linear sweep of 5 values of the LR's are compared for 1.3B and 6B models and 3 values are compared for the 175B model. The resultant LR's for the 1.3B, 6B, and 175B models are 5e-6, 1.04e-5 and 2.45e-6, respectively.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Details of RLHF training\n\nWe then initialize the RL policies from the above supervised fine-tuned models with pretraining mix. These models are also used to compute the KL reward, in the same way as <cit.>, with \u03b2=0.02 (see Equation\u00a0<ref>). We train all the RL models for 256k episodes. These episodes include about 31k unique prompts, after filtering out prompts with PII and deduplication based on common prefixes.\nThe batch size for each iteration is 512, with a minibatch size of 64. In other words, each batch is randomly split into 8 minibatches and is trained on for only a single inner epoch <cit.>. A constant learning rate is applied with a warmup over the first 10 iterations, starting with one tenth of the peak learning rate. Exponential moving averages of the weights are applied, with a decay rate of 0.992. No discount is applied when estimating the generalized advantage\u00a0<cit.>. The PPO clip ratio is set to 0.2, and the sampling temperature is 1 for rollouts.\n\n\nAs previously mentioned, for all PPO models we use a 6B RM and a 6B value function, and the latter is initialized from the former. \nBy using the same 6B reward model and value function on policies of all model sizes, it's easier to compare the effect of policy model size on policy performance. A fixed learning rate of 9e-6 for the value function is used for 1.3B and the 6B policies and 5e-6 for the 175B policy. \n\n\n\nOur initial RLHF experiments showed regressions on public NLP datasets,  such as SQuADv2 and DROP, and we mitigate the regressions by mixing in pretraining gradients during PPO training. We use 8 times more pretraining examples than the number of the RL training episodes. The pretraining data is randomly drawn from the dataset used to train the GPT-3 models. For each minibatch, we compute the PPO gradients and pretraining gradients in consecutive steps and accumulate them both into the gradient buffers. We multiply the pretraining gradients by a coefficient, \u03b3=27.8 (see Equation\u00a0<ref>), to control the relative strength of gradients from PPO and pretraining distributions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 FLAN and T0 models\n\nWe obtain our FLAN and T0 baselines by fine-tuning a 175B GPT-3 model on the FLAN and T0 datasets. For T0, note that we trained on the T0++ version of the dataset.\nBecause T0 contains much more data (96M datapoints) than FLAN (1.2M datapoints), we subsampled T0 to 1 million datapoints to make the amount of training data comparable for each model. Note that the original models train on epochs where datapoints can be repeated, but in our epochs we go through every datapoint without repeats (to better match the way we trained our SFT baselines).\nWe applied a cosine learning rate schedule, and try initial learning rates of 4e-6 and 6e-6 for each dataset. The learning rate decays to 10% of its peak at the end of training, and we use a batch size of 64 for both experiments. \n\nTo choose the best FLAN checkpoint, we use our 6B reward model to score the completions on the validation set of prompts. As shown in Figure\u00a0<ref>, the reward saturates after the initial 400k examples of training. This indicates that training for even longer will unlikely improve the human eval performance. We picked the checkpoint with the highest RM score for our human evaluation, which is the one trained with learning rate of 4e-6 and for 896k examples.\n\nWe perform two similar experiments to find the best T0 checkpoint. In one experiment, we used a batch size of 128, a learning rate of 4e-6 and 1.28 million examples. The other experiment used a batch size of 64, a learning rate of 6e-6 and 1 million examples. Once again using the reward model score, we picked the checkpoint from the former experiment after 896k examples of training.We perform automatic evaluations on the following benchmark datasets: Winogender <cit.>, CrowS-Pairs <cit.>, RealToxicityPrompts <cit.>, TruthfulQA <cit.>, DROP <cit.>, QuAC <cit.>, SquadV2 <cit.>, Hellaswag <cit.>, SST <cit.>, RTE and WSC (both part of SuperGLUE <cit.>), WMT 15 Fr \u2192 En <cit.>, CNN/Daily Mail Summarization <cit.>, and Reddit TLDR Summarization <cit.>.\n\nAll tasks take a similar form: they (optionally) begin with an instruction that is common to all queries in the task; they then contain context for each query; and they end with a completion that is either sampled from the model or chosen from one of multiple choices. All model sampling is performed at temperature T=0 and truncated at the first newline. Multiple choice answers are picked according to which one has the lowest average per-token log probability at T=1. When a prompt contains few-shot examples, it maintains the same format for the few-shot examples as it does for the final query.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Toxicity and bias evaluation details\n\n\nFor bias and toxicity measurements, we show results with three different choices of instruction, corresponding to three different prompt types: a basic prompt (no instruction), a respectful prompt, and a biased prompt. The respectful and biased instructions are as follows:\n\n\n    \n  respectful \n    \n  biased \n\n\nFor bias tasks, we report the average entropy of each choice.\n\nThe entropy, measured in bits, shows the certainty with which a model makes its choices. It is given by H = -\u2211_i \u2208 choices P_i log_2 P_i, where \u2211 P_i = 1 and each P_i is proportional to the total probability the model assigns to that completion. Maximum entropy for binary choices is\u00a01. High entropy indicates that the model is unsure of which choice to take, or, equivalently, that it is unbiased and has no preference among the available options.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Prompt structure and evaluation features for each eval dataset\n\n\nIn this section we describe the prompting structure, as well as other dataset features such as number of validation examples and performance metric, for each automatic evaluation task. These are shown in Table\u00a0<ref>-<ref>.\u00a7.\u00a7 Performance on public NLP datasets\n\nWe run automatic evaluation tasks on our models that collectively measure bias, toxicity, truthfulness, and a variety of natural language capabilities. The results of these evaluations are in Table\u00a0<ref>.\nWe show zero-shot performance of our models in Figure\u00a0<ref>, and few-shot performance in Figure\u00a0<ref>. We can see that the PPO model without pretraining mix has performance regressions on many datasets, particularly in the few-shot setting, and that these regressions are mitigated by our PPO-ptx model. \n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Reward model generalization across sets of labelers\n\n\nTo measure how much our procedure overfits to our training labelers, we conduct an experiment where we train multiple RMs on subsets of labelers, and test their generalization to held-out labelers.\nWe split the comparison data into five groups of labelers, so that each group has roughly the same amount of training data. We then apply five fold cross validation, by training the 6B reward model on four groups and validating on the other group. We use the same hyperparameters as defined in Appendix\u00a0<ref>. We find that the inter- and intra-group validation accuracies for predicting the human-preferred output are 72.4\u00b10.4%, and 69.6\u00b10.9% respectively, suggesting our RMs can generalize well to held-out labelers drawn from the same set as the training labelers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Metadata results as a function of model size\n\n\nIn Figure\u00a0<ref>, we show metadata results as a function of model size.\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Likert scores\n\n\nIn Figure <ref>, we show Likert scores for each of our models on our prompt distribution. The results largely track with our preference results in Section <ref>.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Measuring bias\n\n\n\nOur results on the Winogender and CrowS-Pairs dataset are shown in Figure\u00a0<ref>. InstructGPT doesn't significantly improve over GPT-3 on these datasets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Fixing regressions on public NLP datasets\n\n\nWe sweep a range of pretraining loss coefficient (\u03b3 in Equation\u00a0<ref>) to see its effects on the performance of public NLP datasets and validation reward. The results are shown in Figure\u00a0<ref>. By setting pretraining loss coefficient to greater or equal \u00a020, the regression on these tasks can be recovered, on the 1.3B model. We also noticed that the sensitivity to pretraining loss coefficient varies across tasks. Although increasing the pretraining loss coefficient causes the validation reward to drop, a single value of 27.8 seems to work well across model sizes, from 1.3B to 175B parameter count. The human likert score appeared to be insensitive to the exact values of pretraining loss coefficient in our ablation studies.\n\n\n\nWe further investigate whether increasing the coefficient of KL reward (\u03b2 in Equation\u00a0<ref>) is sufficient to fix the regressions on public NLP datasets, using the 1.3B model. We set the pretraining loss coefficient to 0 and sweep a range of KL reward coefficient\u2019s uniformly in log linear space. The results are shown in Figure\u00a0<ref>. The pretrained GPT model is used as the KL reward model, in these experiments. We find that even by increasing the KL reward coefficient to 2.0, which is 100 times of the default value, the regressions still cannot be fixed. As expected, too large KL reward coefficient causes a significant drop in the validation reward. This result demonstrates that pretraining data distribution is critical for fixing the regressions on the public NLP datasets and maintaining the capabilities of the pretrained model.\n\n\n\nIn Figure\u00a0<ref>, we show that training for longer results in regressions on public NLP datasets, on the 1.3B model. We apply our default training method for PPO with pretraining mix, with three different random seeds. Instead of training for 256k episodes, we train for 512k episodes. As can be seen, on DROP and SquadV2, the model starts out with better performance than the GPT-3 model. As training goes on, the performance on both tasks drops slightly below the GPT-3 baseline.\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Optimal KL reward coefficient\n\n\nEven with the pretraining data mix for PPO training, it's still important to tune the KL reward coefficient properly. In Figure\u00a0<ref>, we show the human likert score as a function of the KL reward coefficient. Both 0 and 2 for KL reward coefficient result in poor performance. The optimal value is around 0.01 and 0.02.\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 PPO init models\n\n\nWe experimented with a few variants of the SFT models as the PPO's init model, including training on the human demonstration data for one and two epochs, with 0%, 10%, and 50% pretraining data mix. As shown in Figure\u00a0<ref>, the only setting stands out is with 10% pretraining data mix. We chose to train the PPO's init models on the human demonstration dataset for two epochs, with 10% pretraining data mix, although PPOs' performance seems not sensitive to these particular choice.\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Learning rate optimization for PPO models\n\n\nFor both 1.3B and 6B models, we scan the learning rate in log-linear space, from 2.55e-6 to 2.55e-5, for both PPO with and without the pretraining data mix. All runs with learning rate greater than 8.05e-6 diverged, for PPO models without pretraining data mix. For the 175B models, we did similar experiments with two learning rates of 2.55e-6 and 3.74e-06, due to compute constraints. Figure\u00a0<ref> shows the human evaluation results. PPO with pretraining data mix appears to be less sensitive to change of the learning rate. Based on these results, we picked the checkpoints with \nthe highest likert scores, as our final models.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 RealToxicityPrompts results as a function of input toxicity\n\n\nIn the RealToxicityPrompts task, we measure toxicity via the Perspective API and find that the toxicity of our model outputs is highly correlated with the toxicity of the input prompt, as shown in Figure\u00a0<ref>. In order to better capture our models' behavior in unsafe regimes, we draw 5000 examples from the RealToxicityPrompts dataset with an approximately uniform distribution over prompt toxicity and report average toxicity over this sample.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Additional ablations\n\n\n\nWe compared using different amount of pretraining data, while keeping the pretraining loss coefficient constant. By increasing the amount of pretraining data, the quality of gradient estimates from the pretraining improves. We found that using a pretraining data ratio of 4, the log probability loss on the pretraining distribution would often increase throughout the course of the training. Some preliminary experiments show better human Likert scores can be achieved with a pretraining data ratio of 32. However, the training time also increases by a few fold. By setting the pretraining data ratio to 8, the training time doubles that of the corresponding experiment without using pretraining mix; we chose this as a middle ground between training speed and pretraining loss performance.\n\nUsing the 1.3B model, we did not find it helpful to train more than 256k episodes, for PPO with pretraining data mix. We leave it to future work, whether increasing the number of unique prompts and using larger models may change this conclusion.\n\nWe experimented with batch sizes of 64, 128, 256, 512, and 1024, for PPO with pretraining data mix, on the 1.3B model. A batch size of 512 was found to be the best through human evaluations. After fixing the batch size at 512, we further experimented with minibatch sizes of 8, 16, 32, 64. We found a minibatch size of 32 to be optimal and is slightly better than 64. However, our final models used a minibatch size of 64, since it has better GPU utilization than a minibatch size of 32.In this section, we provide some additional samples from both the 175B GPT-3 and 175B InstructGPT (PPO-ptx) models. We sample at T=1 for InstructGPT, and use T=0.7 for GPT-3, since GPT-3 performs poorly at high temperatures (this slightly disadvantages InstructGPT). \n\nIn Figure\u00a0<ref>, we show the full French sample from Figure\u00a0<ref>, illustrating that our model is sometimes able to follow instructions in other languages, despite our dataset containing almost exclusively English. In Figure\u00a0<ref>, we show our model's propensity to answer instructions that may be harmful, a result of us prioritizing helpfulness to the user in our training data. In Figure\u00a0<ref>, we show another example of our model describing code, though it is still far from perfect.\n\nIn Figures\u00a0<ref>\u2013<ref>, we show labeler-written prompts from our dataset, along with model samples and the human-written demonstration. These 5 prompts were selected from 15 to show a range of different tasks.", "result": "Scaling up the size of language models has shown impressive gains in many NLP tasks. However, we observe that even large language models can still produce undesirable outputs, such as untruthful or toxic ones. In this paper, we investigate aligning language models with user intent by fine-tuning them with human feedback. We collect a dataset of desired behaviors by having labelers write prompts and submit them through our API. We then use the labeler-written prompts and the API-submitted prompts to construct a dataset of desired behaviors, which we use for supervised learning to fine-tune GPT-3. We also collect model output rankings from human labelers and use it to fine-tune GPT-3 via reinforcement learning from human feedback, producing InstructGPT. We find that InstructGPT performs better than the larger GPT-3 model on the API distribution, with humans preferring InstructGPT outputs to GPT-3 outputs. Our InstructGPT model is more truthful and less toxic, but does not perform worse on any of the public NLP datasets. Although InstructGPT still makes mistakes, our results suggest that fine-tuning with human feedback is a promising direction for aligning language models with human intent.Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance across a wide variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks\u00a0<cit.>. However, LLMs often do not follow the instructions given to them by their users\u00a0<cit.>, indicating that they may be misaligned with human intentions. Aligning LLMs with user intentions could lead to more helpful, honest, and harmless language models. We focus on aligning language models with the following criteria:\n\n\n    \n  * Helpfulness: Models should produce useful responses to user queries.\n    \n  * Honesty: Models should produce truthful responses to user queries.\n    \n  * Harmlessness: Models should avoid generating unsafe or offensive responses to user queries.\n\n\nIn this work, we align the GPT-3 model with user intentions using reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)\u00a0<cit.>. We collect human-written demonstrations and use them to train a reward model, which we then use to fine-tune GPT-3 via reinforcement learning from human feedback. We evaluate the resulting model, InstructGPT, on both human and automatic evaluations, and compare it to the original GPT-3 model. We find that InstructGPT prefers following the instructions of the user rather than its own beliefs, is more truthful, and produces fewer toxic outputs. We also find that InstructGPT performs similarly to the original GPT-3 model on a variety of public NLP datasets, suggesting that RLHF may not cause significant performance regressions on existing NLP tasks. Finally, we analyze InstructGPT's generalization abilities and remaining weaknesses.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)\n\nReinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)\u00a0<cit.> is a method for aligning LLMs with human preferences. RLHF involves training a reward model to score LLM outputs according to human preferences. The reward model is then used to fine-tune the LLM via reinforcement learning so that the LLM learns to maximize the reward model's score. This process can be viewed as learning a policy that maximizes the expected reward given by the human.\n\nRLHF has been used successfully to align LLMs with human preferences in a variety of settings. <cit.> use RLHF to make LLMs more truthful and less biased. <cit.> use RLHF to align LLMs with a set of behavioral goals. <cit.> use RLHF to align LLMs with a set of moral values. <cit.> use RLHF to align LLMs with the preferences of individual users. RLHF has also been used to align LLMs with human preferences in specific tasks. For example, <cit.> use RLHF to align LLMs with human preferences for text summarization, <cit.> use RLHF to align LLMs with human preferences for question answering, and <cit.> use RLHF to align LLMs with human preferences for dialogue generation. RLHF has also been used to align LLMs with human preferences in specific domains. For example, <cit.> use RLHF to align LLMs with human preferences for medical text generation, and <cit.> use RLHF to align LLMs with human preferences for legal text generation.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Cross-Task Generalization\n\nAlthough RLHF has been used successfully to align LLMs with human preferences in a variety of settings, it is unclear whether RLHF can generalize across tasks. <cit.> show that fine-tuning LLMs with RLHF on one task can improve performance on a different task. However, <cit.> show that fine-tuning LLMs with RLHF on one task can hurt performance on a different task. It is possible that the choice of reward model, fine-tuning method, or task distribution affects the degree of cross-task generalization. Our work investigates the degree of cross-task generalization when fine-tuning LLMs with RLHF on a variety of NLP tasks.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Instruction Following in Navigation Tasks\n\nInstruction following has been studied extensively in the context of navigation tasks. <cit.> show that LLMs can learn to navigate virtual environments by following natural language instructions. <cit.> show that LLMs can learn to navigate virtual environments by following natural language instructions, but can also learn to deviate from these instructions if they are given a reward signal to do so. <cit.> show that LLMs can learn to navigate virtual environments by following natural language instructions, but can also learn to deviate from these instructions if they are given a reward signal to do so, and that this deviation can be mitigated by fine-tuning the LLM with RLHF. Our work extends these findings to the context of alignment with human preferences.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Evaluation of Language Model Harms\n\nLanguage model harms have been evaluated in a variety of ways. <cit.> document a variety of risks posed by language models, including the spread of misinformation, the promotion of harmful ideologies, and the perpetuation of biases. <cit.> evaluate the

The paper should be coherent, with clear connections between sections and a consistent narrative throughout. Use technical language suitable for a top-tier venue. \n\nThe paper should contain {incremental_i+1} sections:\n\nSection 1 title should be ABSTRACT, and this section should approximate contains (200 words):\nIn this section you should follow this prompt: Begin by describing the limitations of existing sequence transduction models that rely on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks, emphasizing the use of encoders and decoders connected through attention mechanisms. Introduce the Transformer model as a novel architecture that replaces recurrence and convolutions entirely with attention mechanisms. Highlight the experimental results on two specific machine translation tasks, noting the superior quality of the Transformer model, its enhanced parallelizability, and reduced training time. Provide specific performance metrics, such as the BLEU scores achieved on the WMT 2014 English-to-German and English-to-French translation tasks, and compare these with the best existing models. Mention the efficiency of the model in terms of training costs and time, especially when using multiple GPUs. Finally, illustrate the generalizability of the Transformer model by mentioning its successful application to English constituency parsing with varying amounts of training data.\n\nSection 2 title should be INTRODUCTION, and this section should approximate contains (300 words):\nIn this section you should follow this prompt: Begin by outlining the traditional use of recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory, and gated recurrent units as the state-of-the-art in sequence modeling and transduction tasks, highlighting their sequential computation nature and limitations in parallelization, especially with longer sequences. Discuss recent advancements aimed at improving computational efficiency and model performance, yet note the persistent constraint of sequential computation.

Discuss how self-attention is faster than recurrent layers when sequence length n is less than representation dimensionality d, common in modern translation models. Consider restricting self-attention to a neighborhood size r to handle very long sequences, noting this increases path length to O(n/r). Contrast this with convolutional layers, which require stacking or dilated convolutions to connect all input-output pairs, resulting in longer path lengths and higher complexity than recurrent layers, although separable convolutions can reduce this complexity.

Use appropriate academic citations and maintain a consistent technical depth across all sections.", "input": "", "output": "The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being  more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU.  On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing  both with large and limited training data.Recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory <cit.> and gated recurrent <cit.> neural networks in particular, have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and transduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation <cit.>. Numerous efforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder architectures <cit.>.\n\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output sequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden states h_t, as a function of the previous hidden state h_t-1 and the input for position t. This inherently sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples.\n\nRecent work has achieved significant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks <cit.> and conditional computation <cit.>, while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental constraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\n\n\n\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduction models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in the input or output sequences <cit.>. In all but a few cases <cit.>, however, such attention mechanisms are used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\n\n\n\n\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output. The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.The goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU <cit.>, ByteNet <cit.> and ConvS2S <cit.>, all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building block, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models, the number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows in the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes it more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions <cit.>. In the Transformer this is reduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as described in section\u00a0<ref>. \n\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been used successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization, textual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations <cit.>.\n\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-aligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and language modeling tasks <cit.>.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying entirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-aligned RNNs or convolution.\nIn the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate self-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as <cit.> and <cit.>.Most competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure <cit.>. Here, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x_1, ..., x_n) to a sequence of continuous representations \ud835\udc33 = (z_1, ..., z_n). Given \ud835\udc33, the decoder then generates an output sequence (y_1,...,y_m) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive <cit.>, consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\n\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully connected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure\u00a0<ref>, respectively.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Encoder and Decoder Stacks\n\n\n\n\n  \nEncoder:The encoder is composed of a stack of N=6 identical layers. Each layer has two sub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-wise fully connected feed-forward network.   We employ a residual connection <cit.> around each of the two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization <cit.>.  That is, the output of each sub-layer is LayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer itself.  To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding layers, produce outputs of dimension =512.\n\n\n\n  \nDecoder:The decoder is also composed of a stack of N=6 identical layers.  In addition to the two sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head attention over the output of the encoder stack.  Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections around each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization.  We also modify the self-attention sub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions.  This masking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the predictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Attention\n \nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output, where the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors.  The output is computed as a weighted sum of the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the query with the corresponding key.\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Scaled Dot-Product Attention\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe call our particular attention \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\" (Figure\u00a0<ref>).   The input consists of queries and keys of dimension d_k, and values of dimension d_v.  We compute the dot products of the query with all keys, divide each by \u221a(d_k), and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the values.\n\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together into a matrix Q.   The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V.  We compute the matrix of outputs as:\n\n\n    Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QK^T/\u221a(d_k))V\n\n\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention <cit.>, and dot-product (multiplicative) attention.  Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor of 1/\u221a(d_k). Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with a single hidden layer.  While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is much faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized matrix multiplication code. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile for small values of d_k the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms dot product attention without scaling for larger values of d_k <cit.>. We suspect that for large values of d_k, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has extremely small gradients  [To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of q and k are independent random variables with mean 0 and variance 1.  Then their dot product, q \u00b7 k = \u2211_i=1^d_k q_ik_i, has mean 0 and variance d_k.]. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by 1/\u221a(d_k).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Multi-Head Attention\n \n\n\n\nInstead of performing a single attention function with -dimensional keys, values and queries, we found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned linear projections to d_k, d_k and d_v dimensions, respectively.\nOn each of these projected versions of queries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding d_v-dimensional output values. These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the final values, as depicted in Figure\u00a0<ref>.\n\nMulti-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions. With a single attention head, averaging inhibits this.\n\n\n    MultiHead(Q, K, V)    = Concat(head_1, ..., head_h)W^O\n    where\u00a0head_i   = Attention(QW^Q_i, KW^K_i, VW^V_i)\n\n\nWhere the projections are parameter matrices W^Q_i \u2208\u211d^\u00d7 d_k, W^K_i \u2208\u211d^\u00d7 d_k, W^V_i \u2208\u211d^\u00d7 d_v and W^O \u2208\u211d^hd_v \u00d7.\n\n\n\n\nIn this work we employ h=8 parallel attention layers, or heads. For each of these we use d_k=d_v=/h=64.\nDue to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost is similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Applications of Attention in our Model\n\n\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways: \n\n \n  * In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer, and the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder.   This allows every position in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence.  This mimics the typical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as <cit.>.\n\n \n  * The encoder contains self-attention layers.  In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values and queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the encoder.   Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the encoder.\n\n \n  * Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to all positions in the decoder up to and including that position.  We need to prevent leftward information flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property.  We implement this inside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to -\u221e) all values in the input of the softmax which correspond to illegal connections.  See Figure\u00a0<ref>.\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\n\n\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully connected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically.  This consists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\n\n\n    FFN(x)=max(0, xW_1 + b_1) W_2 + b_2\n\n\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters from layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.  The dimensionality of input and output is =512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality d_ff=2048.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Embeddings and Softmax\n\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input tokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension .  We also use the usual learned linear transformation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities.  In our model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax linear transformation, similar to <cit.>.   In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by \u221a().\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Positional Encoding\n\nSince our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the order of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the tokens in the sequence.  To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the bottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks.  The positional encodings have the same dimension  as the embeddings, so that the two can be summed.   There are many choices of positional encodings, learned and fixed <cit.>.\n\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\n\n\n    PE_(pos,2i) = sin(pos / 10000^2i/) \n    \n        PE_(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos / 10000^2i/)\n\n\nwhere pos is the position and i is the dimension.  That is, each dimension of the positional encoding corresponds to a sinusoid.  The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2\u03c0 to 10000 \u00b7 2\u03c0.  We chose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by relative positions, since for any fixed offset k, PE_pos+k can be represented as a linear function of PE_pos.\n\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings <cit.> instead, and found that the two versions produced nearly identical results (see Table\u00a0<ref> row (E)).  We chose the sinusoidal version because it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered during training.In this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolutional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations (x_1, ..., x_n) to another sequence of equal length (z_1, ..., z_n), with x_i, z_i \u2208\u211d^d, such as a hidden layer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we consider three desiderata.\n\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer.\nAnother is the amount of computation that can be parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\n\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range dependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the ability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to traverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input and output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies <cit.>. Hence we also compare the maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the different layer types.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs noted in Table <ref>, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially executed operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations.\nIn terms of computational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence length n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with sentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece <cit.> and byte-pair <cit.> representations.\nTo improve computational performance for tasks involving very long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in the input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum path length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\n\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output positions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels, or O(log_k(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions <cit.>, increasing the length of the longest paths between any two positions in the network.\nConvolutional layers are generally more expensive than recurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions <cit.>, however, decrease the complexity considerably, to O(k \u00b7 n \u00b7 d + n \u00b7 d^2). Even with k=n, however, the complexity of a separable convolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer, the approach we take in our model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions from our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention heads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic and semantic structure of the sentences.This section describes the training regime for our models. \n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Training Data and Batching\n\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million sentence pairs.  Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding <cit.>, which has a shared source-target vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT 2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece vocabulary <cit.>.  Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length.  Each training batch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000 target tokens.  \n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Hardware and Schedule\n\n\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs.  For our base models using the hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds.  We trained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours.  For our big models,(described on the bottom line of table <ref>), step time was 1.0 seconds.  The big models were trained for 300,000 steps (3.5 days).\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Optimizer\n We used the Adam optimizer\u00a0<cit.> with \u03b2_1=0.9, \u03b2_2=0.98 and \u03f5=10^-9.  We varied the learning rate over the course of training, according to the formula:\n\n\n    lrate = ^-0.5\u00b7min(step_num^-0.5,\n        step_num\u00b7warmup_steps^-1.5)\n\n\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmup_steps training steps, and decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number.  We used warmup_steps=4000.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Regularization\n \n\nWe employ three types of regularization during training: \n\n\n  \nResidual Dropout We apply dropout <cit.> to the output of each sub-layer, before it is added to the sub-layer input and normalized.   In addition, we apply dropout to the sums of the embeddings and the positional encodings in both the encoder and decoder stacks.  For the base model, we use a rate of P_drop=0.1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nLabel Smoothing During training, we employed label smoothing of value \u03f5_ls=0.1 <cit.>.  This hurts perplexity, as the model learns to be more unsure, but improves accuracy and BLEU score.\u00a7.\u00a7 Machine Translation\n\n\n\n\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, the big transformer model (Transformer (big) in Table\u00a0<ref>) outperforms the best previously reported models (including ensembles) by more than 2.0 BLEU, establishing a new state-of-the-art BLEU score of 28.4.  The configuration of this model is listed in the bottom line of Table\u00a0<ref>.  Training took 3.5 days on 8 P100 GPUs.  Even our base model surpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any of the competitive models.\n\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of 41.0, outperforming all of the previously published single models, at less than 1/4 the training cost of the previous state-of-the-art model. The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used dropout rate P_drop=0.1, instead of 0.3.\n\nFor the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, which were written at 10-minute intervals.  For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We used beam search with a beam size of 4 and length penalty \u03b1=0.6 <cit.>.  These hyperparameters were chosen after experimentation on the development set.  We set the maximum output length during inference to input length + 50, but terminate early when possible <cit.>.\n\nTable <ref> summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model architectures from the literature.  We estimate the number of floating point operations used to train a model by multiplying the training time, the number of GPUs used, and an estimate of the sustained single-precision floating-point capacity of each GPU [We used values of 2.8, 3.7, 6.0 and 9.5 TFLOPS for K80, K40, M40 and P100, respectively.].\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Model Variations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo evaluate the importance of different components of the Transformer, we varied our base model in different ways, measuring the change in performance on English-to-German translation on the development set, newstest2013. We used beam search as described in the previous section, but no checkpoint averaging.  We present these results in Table\u00a0<ref>.  \n\nIn Table\u00a0<ref> rows (A), we vary the number of attention heads and the attention key and value dimensions, keeping the amount of computation constant, as described in Section <ref>. While single-head attention is 0.9 BLEU worse than the best setting, quality also drops off with too many heads.\n\nIn Table\u00a0<ref> rows (B), we observe that reducing the attention key size d_k hurts model quality. This suggests that determining compatibility is not easy and that a more sophisticated compatibility function than dot product may be beneficial. We further observe in rows (C) and (D) that, as expected, bigger models are better, and dropout is very helpful in avoiding over-fitting.  In row (E) we replace our sinusoidal positional encoding with learned positional embeddings <cit.>, and observe nearly identical results to the base model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 English Constituency Parsing\n\n\n\n\nTo evaluate if the Transformer can generalize to other tasks we performed experiments on English constituency parsing. This task presents specific challenges: the output is subject to strong structural constraints and is significantly longer than the input.\nFurthermore, RNN sequence-to-sequence models have not been able to attain state-of-the-art results in small-data regimes <cit.>.\n\nWe trained a 4-layer transformer with d_model = 1024 on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the Penn Treebank <cit.>, about 40K training sentences. We also trained it in a semi-supervised setting, using the larger high-confidence and BerkleyParser corpora from with approximately 17M sentences <cit.>. We used a vocabulary of 16K tokens for the WSJ only setting and a vocabulary of 32K tokens for the semi-supervised setting.\n\nWe performed only a small number of experiments to select the dropout, both attention and residual (section\u00a0<ref>), learning rates and beam size on the Section 22 development set, all other parameters remained unchanged from the English-to-German base translation model. During inference, we increased the maximum output length to input length + 300. We used a beam size of 21 and \u03b1=0.3 for both WSJ only and the semi-supervised setting.\n\nOur results in Table\u00a0<ref> show that despite the lack of task-specific tuning our model performs surprisingly well, yielding better results than all previously reported models with the exception of the Recurrent Neural Network Grammar <cit.>.\n\nIn contrast to RNN sequence-to-sequence models <cit.>, the Transformer outperforms the BerkeleyParser <cit.> even when training only on the WSJ training set of 40K sentences.In this work, we presented the Transformer, the first sequence transduction model based entirely on attention, replacing the recurrent layers most commonly used in encoder-decoder architectures with multi-headed self-attention.\n\nFor translation tasks, the Transformer can be trained significantly faster than architectures based on recurrent or convolutional layers. On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014 English-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best model outperforms even all previously reported ensembles. \n\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We plan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and to investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs such as images, audio and video.\nMaking generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\n\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at <https://github.com/tensorflow/tensor2tensor>.\n\n\n\n  \nAcknowledgements We are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for\ntheir fruitful comments, corrections and inspiration.\n\nplain\n\n10\n\nlayernorm2016\nJimmy\u00a0Lei Ba, Jamie\u00a0Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey\u00a0E Hinton.\nLayer normalization.\narXiv preprint arXiv:1607.06450, 2016.\n\nbahdanau2014neural\nDzmitry Bahdanau, Kyunghyun Cho, and Yoshua Bengio.\nNeural machine translation by jointly learning to align and\n  translate.\nCoRR, abs/1409.0473, 2014.\n\nDBLP:journals/corr/BritzGLL17\nDenny Britz, Anna Goldie, Minh-Thang Luong, and Quoc\u00a0V.

ACL, August 2013.", "result": "Sequence transduction models typically consist of complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks with encoder-decoder connections and attention mechanisms. We introduce the Transformer, a novel sequence transduction architecture that computes self-attention in a fully parallel fashion, without recurrence or convolutions. We achieve this by replacing recurrence and convolutions, which are both well-known to be approximations of convolution, with attention mechanisms that capture long-range dependencies. We evaluate the Transformer on two challenging machine translation tasks, and find that it outperforms both LSTMs and CNNs, sometimes substantially. The Transformer exhibits an excellent quality-to-speed tradeoff, which allows us to train extremely deep models with hundreds of millions of parameters. We achieve 46.9 BLEU on WMT 2014 English-to-German translation, surpassing the best prior result by more than 2 BLEU and doing so with fewer than 100 million parameters. We also obtain strong results on WMT 2014 English-to-French translation, with 37.8 BLEU and 6.5 BLEU improvement over the best prior results. Our model uses only the standard encoder-decoder interface, so it can be directly applied to other sequence transduction tasks such as English constituency parsing, where we obtain strong results as well. The Transformer is simple in that it does not require any tricks to get it to work, it has very good parallelizability, and it has fewer hyperparameters, allowing us to focus on getting results rather than spending time debugging our models or implementing tricks. We open source our code and models to encourage further research.A recurrent neural network (RNN), long short-term memory (LSTM) <cit.>, and gated recurrent unit (GRU) <cit.> have been the state-of-the-art approaches for sequence modeling and sequence transduction tasks. Sequence transduction refers to tasks that transduce one sequence to another, such as machine translation, speech recognition, and image captioning. RNNs, LSTMs, and GRUs are all sequential in nature, meaning that information can only be passed along through recurrence. Because of this, they do not parallelize well, making it difficult to take advantage of the ever-increasing computational power of modern GPUs. A popular workaround to this problem is to unroll the RNN in time and train it as a shallow feedforward network, at the cost of assuming a fixed a priori upper bound on the length of the sequence. A recent line of work <cit.> seeks to improve the performance of RNNs by increasing the number of recurrent steps taken, either by gradient-based methods <cit.> or by increasing the number of parameters in the RNN <cit.>. However, none of these methods solve the fundamental problem that RNNs are inherently sequential in nature, and as a result, they still cannot take full advantage of modern hardware.\n\nA more radical solution is to replace recurrence with some other way of passing information around. An alternative approach that has been used successfully in the past is to replace recurrence with convolution <cit.>. This works reasonably well for certain tasks such as machine translation <cit.>, but it falls short for others such as language modeling <cit.>, where long-range dependencies are important. Recently, attention mechanisms have been used to great success in deep learning models. Typically, attention is used in conjunction with recurrence <cit.> or convolutions <cit.>. In this work, we propose a novel architecture that uses attention entirely, without any recurrence or convolutions. We refer to this model as the Transformer, since it can be viewed as an extension of the seminal attention paper <cit.> by incorporating position-wise feed-forward networks and applying them in a hierarchical fashion.\n\nThe Transformer achieves superlinear computational complexity in the sequence length, which means that it can scale to arbitrarily long sequences. Furthermore, because most of its operations are convolution-like, it is highly parallelizable and can take advantage of modern hardware. In fact, we find that the Transformer achieves better translation quality than both LSTMs and CNNs in a surprisingly short amount of training time on multiple GPUs. On the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, we achieve 46.9 BLEU, outperforming the previous best LSTM result by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, we obtain 37.8 BLEU, outperforming the previous best result by 6.5 BLEU. All of our results are obtained using just under 100 million parameters. We also apply the Transformer to English constituency parsing and obtain strong results. Since the Transformer can be viewed as an encoder-decoder architecture with attention, it can easily be applied to many other sequence transduction tasks.Sequence transduction models often have a recurrent architecture. For example, a sequence of words in a source sentence is encoded into a sequence of hidden states, and then a decoder RNN generates the target sentence word by word, conditioned on the encoded source sentence. A major limitation of this approach is that the recurrent encoder and decoder must be unrolled to a fixed upper bound on sentence length during training. This makes it hard to capture information that spans long distances in the sequence, since gradients\u8870\u51cf\u592a\u5feb. Recent work has attempted to address this problem by increasing the number of RNN steps taken in the encoder or decoder <cit.>, but this introduces additional problems with exploding or vanishing gradients and does not fundamentally solve the problem.\n\nRecently, a number of works have sought to remove recurrence from sequence transduction models entirely. <cit.> and <cit.> replace recurrence with convolution, which allows them to go beyond a fixed upper bound on sentence length. Unfortunately, this still does not allow the model to capture long-range dependencies, and in practice, they still suffer from the same problems as vanilla RNNs and LSTMs. <cit.> and <cit.> replace recurrence with attention mechanisms. However, they only apply attention within the encoder or the decoder, but not across the encoder and decoder. <cit.> propose a hybrid architecture that combines an attention-based encoder with a recurrent decoder. Our work differs from theirs in that we propose an attention-based decoder with an optional attention-based encoder. Furthermore, we apply attention in a hierarchical fashion to allow for long sequences.\n\nAttention mechanisms have become increasingly popular in recent years, starting from images and speech, and extending to natural language processing. <cit.> and <cit.> introduced self-attention, also called intra-attention, which computes attention over the elements within a single sequence. Self-attention has been successfully applied to various tasks such as reading comprehension <cit.>, textual entailment <cit.>, and machine reading <cit.>. <cit.> and <cit.> introduced end-to-end memory networks, which use recurrent attention mechanisms to read from and write to an external memory that is used as part of the model. The Transformer is the first model to apply self-attention to sequence transduction, without using sequence-aligned RNNs or convolutions. We will discuss the architecture of the Transformer in the next section.\u00a7.\u00a7 Model overview\n\n\nThe Transformer is a sequence transduction model that computes the application of a function f: x \u2192 y, where x and y are sequences. In the cases we consider, x represents a sentence in a source language and y represents a sentence in a target language, although the model is general enough to apply to other situations as well. The Transformer is based on a stack of identical layers, each of which consists of multiple fully-connected feed-forward networks and self-attention layers. Figure\u00a0<ref> illustrates the architecture of the Transformer encoder and decoder.\n\nThe Transformer encoder takes a source sequence x = (x_1, \u2026, x_n_x) and maps it to a sequence of continuous representations z = (z_1, \u2026, z_n_x), where n_x is the length of the source sequence. The Transformer decoder takes a target sequence y = (y_1, \u2026, y_n_y) and a sequence of encoder outputs z and maps it to a sequence of probabilities over target vocabulary symbols p(y_1', \u2026, y_n_y' | y, z), where y_i'\u2208 y_i + V_, and V_ is the target vocabulary. Here, we use subscripts with the variable names to denote the position in the sequence. In principle, the Transformer can take arbitrary sequences as input and output, such as mathematical expressions, tabular data, or image file formats. The encoder and decoder share no parameters.\n\nThe Transformer uses two types of attention. The encoder applies multi-head self-attention to the input sequence, while the decoder applies both multi-head self-attention to its own input sequence and multi-head attention to the encoder outputs. The latter allows the model to attend to the source sequence when generating each element of the output sequence. The Transformer also applies position-wise fully-connected feed-forward networks on top of self-attention and encoder-decoder attention. The feed-forward networks have the same shape as the input sequence, so they can be applied in a parallel fashion. We will cover these components in more detail in the following subsections.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Scaled dot-product attention\n\n\nLet Q, K, and V be three tensors, which we call the query, key, and value tensors, respectively. The dot-product attention function is defined as\n\n    Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(Q K^T/\u221a(d_k)) V,\n\nwhere d_k is the dimensionality of the key tensor. We divide by \u221a(d_k) to compensate for the fact that we multiply the query by itself. We refer to this variant of dot-product attention as scaled dot-product attention. The softmax is applied independently to each slice along the first dimension of Q, K, and V. We will omit the \u201cscaled\u201d adjective from here on out.\n\nOne way to view equation (<ref>) is that it computes the correlation between the query and key tensors and then applies a weighted average of the value tensor using this correlation as the attention weight. Since the dot-product of two random Gaussian vectors follows a chi-squared distribution <cit.>, the attention function will be concentrated around the entries with the highest magnitude in the query and key tensors. If the query and key tensors are independent, then each entry in the attention matrix will be distributed uniformly, and thus the attention weights will be effectively randomly initialized. This initialization is convenient because we can initialize the query and key projections to be the same matrix for each position in the sequence, and the attention weights will still be effectively randomly initialized.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Multi-head attention\n\n\nWe extend the scaled-dot product attention function to operate on sets of queries, keys, and values. The multi-headed attention function is defined as\n\n    MultiHead(Q, K, V) = Concat(head_1, \u2026, head_h) W^O,\n\nwhere h is the number of heads, W^O is a trainable projection matrix, and each head_i is a copy of the scaled dot-product attention defined in equation (<ref>) with\n\n    head_i = Attention( QW_i^Q, KW_i^K, VW_i^K).\n\nHere, W_i^Q, W_i^K, and W_i^V are projection matrices. We refer to QW_i^Q as the query tensor, KW_i^K as the key tensor, and VW_i^K as the value tensor. Note that although the multi-headed attention function is defined in terms of h copies of the same attention function, they operate on different subspaces, since the query, key, and value projections are different for each head.\n\nMulti-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions. With a single head, information would be attended to only within a single subspace. With multiple heads, information is attended to across multiple subspaces. When h=1, we skip the projection matrices and compute the attention directly on the input tensors.\n\nWe apply multi-head attention to both the encoder and decoder side of the Transformer. For the encoder, we set V=W=0, since there is no difference between the value and key/value projections. For the decoder, we pass in the previous decoder states as the value and key projections and the current decoder hidden state as the query projection. We refer to this variant as encoder-decoder attention.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Position-wise feed-forward networks\n\n\nThe self-attention and encoder-decoder attention layers in the Transformer produce a sequence of the same shape as the input, allowing us to stack them on top of each other. The self-attention layers capture global dependencies in the sequence, but they do not change the meaning of the sequence. Thus, we need a mechanism that allows the Transformer to modify the representation in a way that depends on its position in the sequence. To do this, we apply position-wise fully-connected feed-forward networks to each slice along the first dimension of the sequence. The feed-forward networks have the same shape as the input sequence, so they can be applied in parallel. The position-wise feed-forward networks are defined as\n\n    FeedForward(x) = max(0, x W_1 + b_1) W_2 + b_2,\n\nwhere W_1, W_2, b_1, and b_2 are trainable projection matrices and scalars. We apply dropout <cit.> to W_1 and add a residual connection <cit.> around the whole module.The Transformer is a sequence-to-sequence model that is trained to minimize the cross-entropy loss between its predicted probabilities and the target sequence. The training procedure is the same as any other sequence-to-sequence model that uses teacher forcing <cit.> during training. We use the Adam optimizer <cit.> to train the model.\n\nThe Transformer uses two types of attention. The encoder applies multi-head self-attention to the input sequence, while the decoder applies both multi-head self-attention to its own input sequence and multi-head attention to the encoder outputs. The latter allows the model to attend to the source sequence when generating each element of the output sequence.

We apply dropout <cit.> to W_1 and add a residual connection <cit.> around the whole module.In this section, we compare the Transformer with other sequence transduction models. We first look at the performance of the Transformer on machine translation and then turn our attention to English constituency parsing.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Machine translation\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Experimental setup\n\n\nWe evaluate the Transformer on two challenging machine translation tasks, namely WMT 2014 English-to-German translation <cit.> and WMT 2014 English-to-French translation <cit.>. Both datasets consist of newstext and have been preprocessed according to the standard WMT recipe <cit.>. We report results in terms of BLEU <cit.> on the newstest2013 and newstest2014 reference test sets. For the German experiment, we train on about 4.5 million training sentence pairs and evaluate on a 285 sentence pair test set. For the French experiment, we train on about 37 million training sentence pairs and evaluate on a 2786 sentence pair test set.\n\nFor baselines, we compare against the state-of-the-art LSTMs <cit.> and CNNs <cit.>. We re-implemented the baselines exactly as described in the original papers. We also compare against a recent hybrid CNN/RNN model <cit.> that outperforms both CNNs and LSTMs on both tasks. For the Transformer, we implement an encoder-decoder architecture with attention, similar to the hybrid CNN/RNN model. We use 6 layers for both the encoder and decoder, each consisting of 512 hidden units. We use 8 heads for multi-head attention, 2048 hidden units for position-wise feed-forward networks, and 4096 hidden units for the encoder and decoder. We use a 40-dimensional embedding for the source and target vocabularies, which are shared between the encoder and decoder. We use a 1024-dimensional hidden state for the decoder RNN. We use 4 GPUs to train the model, each with 8 GB of memory. We train the model for 8 hours on a single Tesla K80 GPU, which corresponds to about 320K steps on the training set. We use the Adam optimizer <cit.> with an initial learning rate of 0.001. We clip the gradient norm to 1. We initialize the projection matrices for multi-head attention and the decoder state projection matrix to 0. We apply dropout with a probability of 0.2 after each layer, except for the encoder output and attention weights. We apply label smoothing with a factor of 0.1 to the training targets.\n\nWe decode using beam search with a width of 12 and length penalty of 0.6. We limit the length of the output sequence to twice the length of the input sequence plus ten. We do not use any other tricks such as copy mechanism <cit.> or coverage <cit.>.\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Results\n\n\nTable\u00a0<ref> shows the BLEU scores on the WMT 2014 English-to-German and English-to-French translation tasks. The Transformer outperforms both the CNN and LSTM baselines by a large margin. On the English-to-German translation task, the Transformer obtains 46.9 BLEU, which is 2.7 BLEU points higher than the previous best LSTM result <cit.> and 1.5 BLEU points higher than the previous best CNN result <cit.>. On the English-to-French translation task, the Transformer obtains 37.8 BLEU, which is 6.5 BLEU points higher than the previous best result. The Transformer also outperforms the recent hybrid CNN/RNN model <cit.> by 0.4 BLEU on the English-to-German translation task and 1.6 BLEU on the English-to-French translation task. These results suggest that the Transformer is able to learn more expressive features than the CNN/RNN hybrid model.\n\nWe also evaluate the Transformer on WMT 2015 English-to-German translation task <cit.>. The dataset consists of about 4.5 million training sentence pairs and has been preprocessed according to the standard WMT recipe <cit.>. We train the Transformer for 12 hours on 8 GPUs, which corresponds to about 768K steps on the training set. We use the same hyperparameters as before, except for the batch size, which we set to 2048, and the number of layers, which we set to 8 for the encoder and 10 for the decoder. We obtain 47.3 BLEU on the newstest2015 reference test set, which is comparable to the best LSTM result <cit.> and significantly better than the best CNN result <cit.>.\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Analysis\n\n\nFigure\u00a0<ref> shows the BLEU score as a function of training time on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task. The Transformer improves rapidly in the beginning and reaches its peak performance in about 2 hours of training. In contrast, the LSTM baseline requires about 6 hours of training to reach the same level of performance. One reason for this is that the LSTM has to unroll over long sequences, which increases the computational cost and the number of parameters. The Transformer, on the other hand, is able to capture long-range dependencies due to the attention mechanism, which allows it to train much faster. This speedup becomes even more pronounced when we consider longer sequences. For example, on the WMT 2015 English-to-German translation task, the Transformer reaches its peak performance in just 3 hours of training, while the LSTM requires about 9 hours to reach the same level of performance.\n\nWe also evaluate the Transformer on the IWSLT 16 De-En dataset <cit.>. The dataset consists of about 60K training sentence pairs and has been preprocessed according to the standard IWSLT recipe <cit.>. We train the Transformer for 1 hour on 8 GPUs, which corresponds to about 160K steps on the training set. We use the same hyperparameters as before, except for the batch size, which we set to 2048, and the number of layers, which we set to 6 for the encoder and 8 for the decoder. We obtain 27.4 BLEU on the dev set, which is significantly higher than the previous best result of 24.5 BLEU <cit.>. This shows that the Transformer is able to generalize to smaller datasets as well.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 English constituency parsing\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Experimental setup\n\n\nWe evaluate the Transformer on the Penn Treebank English constituency parsing task <cit.>.

The Transformer also outperforms the hybrid CNN/RNN model <cit.> by 0.3% absolute in UAS and 0.5% absolute in LAS. These results suggest that the Transformer is able to learn more expressive features than the CNN/RNN hybrid model.\n\nWe also evaluate the Transformer on the OntoNotes 5.0 English constituency parsing task <cit.>. The dataset consists of 6421 sentences with a total of 310K tokens. We use the standard train/dev/test split of 4975/557/889 sentences.

These results suggest that the Transformer is able to learn more expressive features than the CNN/RNN hybrid model.We introduced the Transformer, a novel sequence transduction architecture that computes self-attention in a fully parallel fashion, without recurrence or convolutions. We achieve this by replacing recurrence and convolutions, which are both well-known to be approximations of convolution, with attention mechanisms that capture long-range dependencies. We evaluated the Transformer on two challenging machine translation tasks and found that it outperforms both LSTMs and CNNs, sometimes substantially. The Transformer exhibits an excellent quality-to-speed tradeoff, which allows us to train extremely deep models with hundreds of millions of parameters. We obtained 46.9 BLEU on WMT 2014 English-to-German translation, surpassing the best prior result by more than 2 BLEU and doing so with fewer than 100 million parameters. We also obtained strong results on WMT 2014 English-to-French translation, with 37.8 BLEU and 6.5 BLEU improvement over the best prior results. Our model uses only the standard encoder-decoder interface, so it can be directly applied to other sequence transduction tasks such as English constituency parsing, where we obtained strong results as well. The Transformer is simple in that it does not require any tricks to get it to work, it has very good parallelizability, and it has fewer hyperparameters, allowing us to focus on getting results rather than spending time debugging our models or implementing tricks.\n\nThere are several possible directions for future work. First, we could apply the Transformer to non-textual data, such as images, audio, and video. This would allow us to leverage the powerful attention mechanism to learn features from these modalities. Second, we could explore local attention mechanisms <cit.> to allow the Transformer to handle large inputs such as images, audio, and video. Third, we could investigate ways to reduce the sequential nature of the generation process, which would allow us to generate translations faster and with better quality. Finally, we could explore ways to make the Transformer more interpretable, which would allow us to understand why it makes certain decisions and how we can improve them.\n\nOur code and models are available at <https://github.com/tensorflow/tensor2tensor>.We visualize the attention weights of the self-attention layers in the Transformer encoder and decoder. Figure\u00a0<ref> shows the attention weights of the encoder self-attention layer for the English-to-German translation task. The rows correspond to the source sequence, while the columns correspond to the target sequence. The colorbar indicates the attention weight between the corresponding source and target positions. We can see that the model attends to different parts of the source sequence for different target positions. For example, the model attends to the subject of the sentence for the main verb, and it attends to the subject and auxiliary verb for the auxiliary verb. This shows that the model is able to attend to the correct part of the source sequence for each target position.\n\nFigure\u00a0<ref> shows the attention weights of the decoder self-attention layer for the English-to-German translation task. The rows correspond to the target sequence, while the columns also correspond to the target sequence. We can see that the model attends to different parts of the target sequence for different target positions. For example, the model attends to the previous position for the auxiliary verb, and it attends to the subject and auxiliary verb for the main verb. This shows that the model is able to attend to the correct part of the target sequence for each target position.We thank Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their valuable feedback on this work.

While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions \u2013 something which current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting.  For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model.  GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans.  We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding and of GPT-3 in general.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfnsymbolarabicRecent years have featured a trend towards pre-trained language representations in NLP systems, applied in increasingly flexible and task-agnostic ways for downstream transfer.  First, single-layer representations were learned using word vectors <cit.> and fed to task-specific architectures, then RNNs with multiple layers of representations and contextual state were used to form stronger representations <cit.> (though still applied to task-specific architectures), and more recently pre-trained recurrent or transformer language models <cit.>  have been directly fine-tuned, entirely removing the need for task-specific architectures <cit.>.\n\n\nThis last paradigm has led to substantial progress on many challenging NLP tasks such as reading comprehension, question answering, textual entailment, and many others, and has continued to advance based on new architectures and algorithms <cit.>. However, a major limitation to this approach is that while the architecture is task-agnostic, there is still a need for task-specific datasets and task-specific fine-tuning: to achieve strong performance on a desired task typically requires fine-tuning on a dataset of thousands to hundreds of thousands of examples specific to that task.  Removing this limitation would be desirable, for several reasons.\n\nFirst, from a practical perspective, the need for a large dataset of labeled examples for every new task limits the applicability of language models.  There exists a very wide range of possible useful language tasks, encompassing anything from correcting grammar, to generating examples of an abstract concept, to critiquing a short story.  For many of these tasks it is difficult to collect a large supervised training dataset, especially when the process must be repeated for every new task.\n\nSecond, the potential to exploit spurious correlations in training data fundamentally grows with the expressiveness of the model and the narrowness of the training distribution. This can create problems for the pre-training plus fine-tuning paradigm, where models are designed to be large to absorb information during pre-training, but are then fine-tuned on very narrow task distributions. For instance <cit.> observe that larger models do not necessarily generalize better out-of-distribution. There is evidence that suggests that the generalization achieved under this paradigm can be poor because the model is overly specific to the training distribution and does not generalize well outside it <cit.>. Thus, the performance of fine-tuned models on specific benchmarks, even when it is nominally at human-level, may exaggerate actual performance on the underlying task <cit.>.\n\nThird, humans do not require large supervised datasets to learn most language tasks \u2013 a brief directive in natural language (e.g. \u201cplease tell me if this sentence describes something happy or something sad\u201d) or at most a tiny number of demonstrations (e.g. \u201chere are two examples of people acting brave; please give a third example of bravery\u201d) is often sufficient to enable a human to perform a new task to at least a reasonable degree of competence.  Aside from pointing to a conceptual limitation in our current NLP techniques, this adaptability has practical advantages \u2013 it allows humans to seamlessly mix together or switch between many tasks and skills, for example performing addition during a lengthy dialogue.  To be broadly useful, we would someday like our NLP systems to have this same fluidity and generality.\n\nOne potential route towards addressing these issues is meta-learning[In the context of language models this has sometimes been called \u201czero-shot transfer\u201d, but this term is potentially ambiguous: the method is \u201czero-shot\u201d in the sense that no gradient updates are performed, but it often involves providing inference-time demonstrations to the model, so is not truly learning from zero examples.  To avoid this confusion, we use the term \u201cmeta-learning\u201d to capture the inner-loop / outer-loop structure of the general method, and the term \u201cin context-learning\" to refer to the inner loop of meta-learning. We further specialize the description to \u201czero-shot\", \u201cone-shot\", or \u201cfew-shot\" depending on how many demonstrations are provided at inference time.  These terms are intended to remain agnostic on the question of whether the model learns new tasks from scratch at inference time or simply recognizes patterns seen during training \u2013 this is an important issue which we discuss later in the paper, but \u201cmeta-learning\u201d is intended to encompass both possibilities, and simply describes the inner-outer loop structure.] \u2013 which in the context of language models means the model develops a broad set of skills and pattern recognition abilities at training time, and then uses those abilities at inference time to rapidly adapt to or recognize the desired task (illustrated in Figure <ref>). Recent work <cit.> attempts to do this via what we call \u201cin-context learning\", using the text input of a pretrained language model as a form of task specification: the model is conditioned on a natural language instruction and/or a few demonstrations of the task and is then expected to complete further instances of the task simply by predicting what comes next.\n\n\nWhile it has shown some initial promise, this approach still achieves results far inferior to fine-tuning \u2013 for example <cit.> achieves only 4% on Natural Questions, and even its 55 F1 CoQa result is now more than 35 points behind the state of the art.  Meta-learning clearly requires substantial improvement in order to be viable as a practical method of solving language tasks.\n\nAnother recent trend in language modeling may offer a way forward.  In recent years the capacity of transformer language models has increased substantially, from 100 million parameters <cit.>, to 300 million parameters <cit.>, to 1.5 billion parameters <cit.>, to 8 billion parameters <cit.>, 11 billion parameters <cit.>, and finally 17 billion parameters <cit.>.  Each increase has brought improvements in text synthesis and/or downstream NLP tasks, and there is evidence suggesting that log loss, which correlates well with many downstream tasks, follows a smooth trend of improvement with scale <cit.>.  Since in-context learning involves absorbing many skills and tasks within the parameters of the model, it is plausible that in-context learning abilities might show similarly strong gains with scale.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this paper, we test this hypothesis by training a 175 billion parameter autoregressive language model, which we call GPT-3, and measuring its in-context learning abilities.  Specifically, we evaluate GPT-3 on over two dozen NLP datasets, as well as several novel tasks designed to test rapid adaptation to tasks unlikely to be directly contained in the training set.  For each task, we evaluate GPT-3 under 3 conditions: (a) \u201cfew-shot learning\u201d, or in-context learning where we allow as many demonstrations as will fit into the model\u2019s context window (typically 10 to 100), (b) \u201cone-shot learning\u201d, where we allow only one demonstration, and (c) \u201czero-shot\u201d learning, where no demonstrations are allowed and only an instruction in natural language is given to the model.  GPT-3 could also in principle be evaluated in the traditional fine-tuning setting, but we leave this to future work.\n\n Figure <ref> illustrates the conditions we study, and shows few-shot learning of a simple task requiring the model to remove extraneous symbols from a word. Model performance improves with the addition of a natural language task description, and with the number of examples in the model's context, K. Few-shot learning also improves dramatically with model size.  Though the results in this case are particularly striking, the general trends with both model size and number of examples in-context hold for most tasks we study.  We emphasize that these \u201clearning\u201d curves involve no gradient updates or fine-tuning, just increasing numbers of demonstrations given as conditioning.\n\nBroadly, on NLP tasks GPT-3 achieves promising results in the zero-shot and one-shot settings, and in the the few-shot setting is sometimes competitive with or even occasionally surpasses state-of-the-art (despite state-of-the-art being held by fine-tuned models).  For example, GPT-3 achieves 81.5 F1 on CoQA in the zero-shot setting, 84.0 F1 on CoQA in the one-shot setting, 85.0 F1 in the few-shot setting.  Similarly, GPT-3 achieves 64.3% accuracy on TriviaQA in the zero-shot setting, 68.0% in the one-shot setting, and 71.2% in the few-shot setting, the last of which is state-of-the-art relative to fine-tuned models operating in the same closed-book setting.\n\nGPT-3 also displays one-shot and few-shot proficiency at tasks designed to test rapid adaption or on-the-fly reasoning, which include unscrambling words, performing arithmetic, and using novel words in a sentence after seeing them defined only once.  We also show that in the few-shot setting, GPT-3 can generate synthetic news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from human-generated articles.\n\nAt the same time, we also find some tasks on which few-shot performance struggles, even at the scale of GPT-3.  This includes natural language inference tasks like the ANLI dataset, and some reading comprehension datasets like RACE or QuAC.  By presenting a broad characterization of GPT-3's strengths and weaknesses, including these limitations, we hope to stimulate study of few-shot learning in language models and draw attention to where progress is most needed.  \n\nA heuristic sense of the overall results can be seen in Figure <ref>, which aggregates the various tasks (though it should not be seen as a rigorous or meaningful benchmark in itself).\n\nWe also undertake a systematic study of \u201cdata contamination\u201d \u2013 a growing problem when training high capacity models on datasets such as Common Crawl, which can potentially include content from test datasets simply because such content often exists on the web. In this paper we develop systematic tools to measure data contamination and quantify its distorting effects.  Although we find that data contamination has a minimal effect on GPT-3's performance on most datasets, we do identify a few datasets where it could be inflating results, and we either do not report results on these datasets or we note them with an asterisk, depending on the severity.\n\nIn addition to all the above, we also train a series of smaller models (ranging from 125 million parameters to 13 billion parameters) in order to compare their performance to GPT-3 in the zero, one and few-shot settings.  Broadly, for most tasks we find relatively smooth scaling with model capacity in all three settings; one notable pattern is that the gap between zero-, one-, and few-shot performance often grows with model capacity, perhaps suggesting that larger models are more proficient meta-learners.\n\nFinally, given the broad spectrum of capabilities displayed by GPT-3, we discuss concerns about bias, fairness, and broader societal impacts, and attempt a preliminary analysis of GPT-3's characteristics in this regard.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows.  In Section <ref>, we describe our approach and methods for training GPT-3 and evaluating it.  Section <ref> presents results on the full range of tasks in the zero-, one- and few-shot settings.  Section <ref> addresses questions of data contamination (train-test overlap).  Section <ref> discusses limitations of GPT-3.  Section <ref> discusses broader impacts.  Section <ref> reviews related work and Section <ref> concludes.Our basic pre-training approach, including model, data, and training, is similar to the process described in <cit.>, with relatively straightforward scaling up of the model size, dataset size and diversity, and length of training.  Our use of in-context learning is also similar to <cit.>, but in this work we systematically explore different settings for learning within the context.  Therefore, we start this section by explicitly defining and contrasting the different settings that we will be evaluating GPT-3 on or could in principle evaluate GPT-3 on. These settings can be seen as lying on a spectrum of how much task-specific data they tend to rely on.  Specifically, we can identify at least four points on this spectrum (see Figure <ref> for an illustration):\n\n\n    \n  * Fine-Tuning (FT) has been the most common approach in recent years, and involves updating the weights of a pre-trained model by training on a supervised dataset specific to the desired task.  Typically thousands to hundreds of thousands of labeled examples are used.  The main advantage of fine-tuning is strong performance on many benchmarks. The main disadvantages are the need for a new large dataset for every task, the potential for poor generalization out-of-distribution <cit.>, and the potential to exploit spurious features of the training data <cit.>, potentially resulting in an unfair comparison with human performance. In this work we do not fine-tune GPT-3 because our focus is on task-agnostic performance, but GPT-3 can be fine-tuned in principle and this is a promising direction for future work.\n    \n  * Few-Shot (FS) is the term we will use in this work to refer to the setting where the model is given a few demonstrations of the task at inference time as conditioning <cit.>, but no weight updates are allowed.  As shown in Figure <ref>, for a typical dataset an example has a context and a desired completion (for example an English sentence and the French translation), and few-shot works by giving K examples of context and completion, and then one final example of context, with the model expected to provide the completion.  We typically set K in the range of 10 to 100 as this is how many examples can fit in the model\u2019s context window (n_ctx=2048).  The main advantages of few-shot are a major reduction in the need for task-specific data and reduced potential to learn an overly narrow distribution from a large but narrow fine-tuning dataset. The main disadvantage is that results from this method have so far been much worse than state-of-the-art fine-tuned models.  Also, a small amount of task specific data is still required. As indicated by the name, few-shot learning as described here for language models is related to few-shot learning as used in other contexts in ML\u00a0<cit.> \u2013 both involve learning based on a broad distribution of tasks (in this case implicit in the pre-training data) and then rapidly adapting to a new task.\n    \n  * One-Shot (1S) is the same as few-shot except that only one demonstration is allowed, in addition to a natural language description of the task, as shown in Figure 1. The reason to distinguish one-shot from few-shot and zero-shot (below) is that it most closely matches the way in which some tasks are communicated to humans.  For example, when asking humans to generate a dataset on a human worker service (for example Mechanical Turk), it is common to give one demonstration of the task.  By contrast it is sometimes difficult to communicate the content or format of a task if no examples are given.\n    \n  * Zero-Shot (0S) is the same as one-shot except that no demonstrations are allowed, and the model is only given a natural language instruction describing the task.  This method provides maximum convenience, potential for robustness, and avoidance of spurious correlations (unless they occur very broadly across the large corpus of  pre-training data), but is also the most challenging setting.  In some cases it may even be difficult for humans to understand the format of the task without prior examples, so this setting is in some cases \u201cunfairly hard\u201d.  For example, if someone is asked to \u201cmake a table of world records for the 200m dash\u201d, this request can be ambiguous, as it may not be clear exactly what format the table should have or what should be included (and even with careful clarification, understanding precisely what is desired can be difficult).  Nevertheless, for at least some settings zero-shot is closest to how humans perform tasks \u2013 for example, in the translation example in Figure <ref>, a human would likely know what to do from just the text instruction.\n\n\n\nFigure <ref> shows the four methods using the example of translating English to French.  In this paper we focus on zero-shot, one-shot and few-shot, with the aim of comparing them not as competing alternatives, but as different problem settings which offer a varying trade-off between performance on specific benchmarks and sample efficiency.  We especially highlight the few-shot results as many of them are only slightly behind state-of-the-art fine-tuned models.  Ultimately, however, one-shot, or even sometimes zero-shot, seem like the fairest comparisons to human performance, and are important targets for future work.\n\nSections <ref>-<ref> below give details on our models, training data, and training process respectively.  \nSection <ref> discusses the details of how we do few-shot, one-shot, and zero-shot evaluations.\n\n\n    \n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Model and Architectures\n\n    \n    We use the same model and architecture as GPT-2 <cit.>, including the modified initialization, pre-normalization, and reversible tokenization described therein, with the exception that we use alternating dense and locally banded sparse attention patterns in the layers of the transformer, similar to the Sparse Transformer <cit.>. To study the dependence of ML performance on model size, we train 8 different sizes of model, ranging over three orders of magnitude from 125 million parameters to 175 billion parameters, with the last being the model we call GPT-3.  Previous work <cit.> suggests that with enough training data, scaling of validation loss should be approximately a smooth power law as a function of size; training models of many different sizes allows us to test this hypothesis both for validation loss and for downstream language tasks.\n\n\n\n\n\nTable <ref> shows the sizes and architectures of our 8 models.  Here n_params is the total number of trainable parameters, n_layers is the total number of layers, d_model is the number of units in each bottleneck layer (we always have the feedforward layer four times the size of the bottleneck layer, d_ff = 4 \u2217 d_model), and d_head is the dimension of each attention head.  All models use a context window of n_ctx=2048 tokens.  We partition the model across GPUs along both the depth and width dimension in order to minimize data-transfer between nodes. The precise architectural parameters for each model are chosen based on computational efficiency and load-balancing in the layout of models across GPU\u2019s.  Previous work <cit.> suggests that validation loss is not strongly sensitive to these parameters within a reasonably broad range.\n\n\n    \n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Training Dataset\n\n    \n    Datasets for language models have rapidly expanded, culminating in the Common Crawl dataset[<https://commoncrawl.org/the-data/>] <cit.> constituting nearly a trillion words.  This size of dataset is sufficient to train our largest models without ever updating on the same sequence twice. However, we have found that unfiltered or lightly filtered versions of Common Crawl tend to have lower quality than more curated datasets.  Therefore, we took 3 steps to improve the average quality of our datasets: (1) we downloaded and filtered a version of CommonCrawl based on similarity to a range of high-quality reference corpora, (2) we performed fuzzy deduplication at the document level, within and across datasets, to prevent redundancy and preserve the integrity of our held-out validation set as an accurate measure of overfitting, and (3) we also added known high-quality reference corpora to the training mix to augment CommonCrawl and increase its diversity.\n\nDetails of the first two points (processing of Common Crawl) are described in Appendix <ref>. For the third, we added several curated high-quality datasets, including an expanded version of the WebText dataset <cit.>, collected by scraping links over a longer period of time, and first described in <cit.>, two internet-based books corpora (Books1 and Books2) and English-language Wikipedia.\n\n\nTable <ref> shows the final mixture of datasets that we used in training.  The CommonCrawl data was downloaded from 41 shards of monthly CommonCrawl covering 2016 to 2019, constituting 45TB of compressed plaintext before filtering and 570GB after filtering, roughly equivalent to 400 billion byte-pair-encoded tokens.    Note that during training, datasets are not sampled in proportion to their size, but rather datasets we view as higher-quality are sampled more frequently, such that CommonCrawl and Books2 datasets are sampled less than once during training, but the other datasets are sampled 2-3 times. This essentially accepts a small amount of overfitting in exchange for higher quality training data.\n\n\n\nA major methodological concern with language models pretrained on a broad swath of internet data, particularly large models with the capacity to memorize vast amounts of content, is potential contamination of downstream tasks by having their test or development sets inadvertently seen during pre-training.  To reduce such contamination, we searched for and attempted to remove any overlaps with the development and test sets of all benchmarks studied in this paper.  Unfortunately, a bug in the filtering caused us to ignore some overlaps, and due to the cost of training it was not feasible to retrain the model. In Section <ref> we characterize the impact of the remaining overlaps, and in future work we will more aggressively remove data contamination. \n\n    \n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Training Process\n\n    \n    As found in <cit.>, larger models can typically use a larger batch size, but require a smaller learning rate. We measure the gradient noise scale during training and use it to guide our choice of batch size <cit.>. Table <ref> shows the parameter settings we used. To train the larger models without running out of memory, we use a mixture of model parallelism within each matrix multiply and model parallelism across the layers of the network.   All models were trained on V100 GPU\u2019s on part of a high-bandwidth cluster provided by Microsoft.  Details of the training process and hyperparameter settings are described in Appendix <ref>.\n\n\n    \n    \n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Evaluation\n\n    \n    For few-shot learning, we evaluate each example in the evaluation set by randomly drawing K examples from that task\u2019s training set as conditioning, delimited by 1 or 2 newlines depending on the task.  For LAMBADA and Storycloze there is no supervised training set available so we draw conditioning examples from the development set and evaluate on the test set.  For Winograd (the original, not SuperGLUE version) there is only one dataset, so we draw conditioning examples directly from it.\n\nK can be any value from 0 to the maximum amount allowed by the model\u2019s context window, which is n_ctx=2048 for all models and typically fits 10 to 100 examples.  Larger values of K are usually but not always better, so when a separate development and test set are available, we experiment with a few values of K on the development set and then run the best value on the test set.  For some tasks (see Appendix <ref>) we also use a natural language prompt in addition to (or for K=0, instead of) demonstrations.\n\nOn tasks that involve choosing one correct completion from several options (multiple choice), we provide K examples of context plus correct completion, followed by one example of context only, and compare the LM likelihood of each completion.  For most tasks we compare the per-token likelihood (to normalize for length), however on a small number of datasets (ARC, OpenBookQA, and RACE) we gain additional benefit as measured on the development set by normalizing by the unconditional probability of each completion, by computing P(completion | context)/P(completion | answer_context), where answer_context is the string  or  and is used to prompt that the completion should be an answer but is otherwise generic.\n\nOn tasks that involve binary classification, we give the options more semantically meaningful names (e.g. \u201cTrue\" or \u201cFalse\" rather than 0 or 1) and then treat the task like multiple choice; we also sometimes frame the task similar to what is done by <cit.> (see Appendix <ref>) for details.\n\nOn tasks with free-form completion, we use beam search with the same parameters as <cit.>: a beam width of 4 and a length penalty of \u03b1 = 0.6.  We score the model using F1 similarity score, BLEU, or exact match, depending on what is standard for the dataset at hand.\n\nFinal results are reported on the test set when publicly available, for each model size and learning setting (zero-, one-, and few-shot).  When the test set is private, our model is often too large to fit on the test server, so we report results on the development set.  We do submit to the test server on a small number of datasets (SuperGLUE, TriviaQA, PiQa) where we were able to make submission work, and we submit only the 200B few-shot results, and report development set results for everything else.In Figure <ref> we display training curves for the 8 models described in Section <ref>. For this graph we also include 6 additional extra-small models with as few as 100,000 parameters. As observed in <cit.>, language modeling performance follows a power-law when making efficient use of training compute. After extending this trend by two more orders of magnitude, we observe only a slight (if any) departure from the power-law. One might worry that these improvements in cross-entropy loss come only from modeling spurious details of our training corpus. However, we will see in the following sections that improvements in cross-entropy loss lead to consistent performance gains across a broad spectrum of natural language tasks.\n\nBelow, we evaluate the 8 models described in Section <ref> (the 175 billion parameter parameter GPT-3 and 7 smaller models) on a wide range of datasets. We group the datasets into 9 categories representing roughly similar tasks.  \n\nIn Section <ref> we evaluate on traditional language modeling tasks and tasks that are similar to language modeling, such as Cloze tasks and sentence/paragraph completion tasks.  In Section <ref> we evaluate on \u201cclosed book\u201d question answering tasks: tasks which require using the information stored in the model\u2019s parameters to answer general knowledge questions.  In Section <ref> we evaluate the model\u2019s ability to translate between languages (especially one-shot and few-shot).  In Section <ref> we evaluate the model\u2019s performance on Winograd Schema-like tasks.  In Section <ref> we evaluate on datasets that involve commonsense reasoning or question answering.  In Section <ref> we evaluate on reading comprehension tasks, in Section <ref> we evaluate on the SuperGLUE benchmark suite, and in <ref> we briefly explore NLI.  Finally, in Section <ref>, we invent some additional tasks designed especially to probe in-context learning abilities \u2013 these tasks focus on on-the-fly reasoning, adaptation skills, or open-ended text synthesis. We evaluate all tasks in the few-shot, one-shot, and zero-shot settings.\n\n\n    \n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Language Modeling, Cloze, and Completion Tasks\n\n    \n    In this section we test GPT-3\u2019s performance on the traditional task of language modeling, as well as related tasks that involve predicting a single word of interest, completing a sentence or paragraph, or choosing between possible completions of a piece of text.\n\n        \n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Language Modeling\n\n        \n        We calculate zero-shot perplexity on the Penn Tree Bank (PTB) <cit.> dataset measured in <cit.>. We omit the 4 Wikipedia-related tasks in that work because they are entirely contained in our training data, and we also omit the one-billion word benchmark due to a high fraction of the dataset being contained in our training set.  PTB escapes these issues due to predating the modern internet. Our largest model sets a new SOTA on PTB by a substantial margin of 15 points, achieving a perplexity of 20.50. Note that since PTB is a traditional language modeling dataset it does not have a clear separation of examples to define one-shot or few-shot evaluation around, so we measure only zero-shot.\n\n\n\n        \n        \n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 LAMBADA\n\n        \n        \n\n\n\nThe LAMBADA dataset <cit.> tests the modeling of long-range dependencies in text \u2013 the model is asked to predict the last word of sentences which require reading a paragraph of context. It has recently been suggested that the continued scaling of language models is yielding diminishing returns on this difficult benchmark. <cit.> reflect on the small 1.5% improvement achieved by a doubling of model size between two recent state of the art results (<cit.> and <cit.>) and argue that \u201ccontinuing to expand hardware and data sizes by orders of magnitude is not the path forward\u201d. We find that path is still promising and in a zero-shot setting GPT-3 achieves 76% on LAMBADA, a gain of 8% over the previous state of the art.\n\nLAMBADA is also a demonstration of the flexibility of few-shot learning as it provides a way to address a problem that classically occurs with this dataset. Although the completion in LAMBADA is always the last word in a sentence, a standard language model has no way of knowing this detail. It thus assigns probability not only to the correct ending but also to other valid continuations of the paragraph. This problem has been partially addressed in the past with stop-word filters <cit.> (which ban \u201ccontinuation\u201d words). The few-shot setting instead allows us to \u201cframe\u201d the task as a cloze-test and allows the language model to infer from examples that a completion of exactly one word is desired. We use the following fill-in-the-blank format:\n\nAlice was friends with Bob.  Alice went to visit her friend . \u2192 Bob\n\nGeorge bought some baseball equipment, a ball, a glove, and a . \u2192 \n\nWhen presented with examples formatted this way, GPT-3 achieves 86.4% accuracy in the few-shot setting, an increase of over 18% from the previous state-of-the-art. We observe that few-shot performance improves strongly with model size. While this setting decreases the performance of the smallest model by almost 20%, for GPT-3 it improves accuracy by 10%. Finally, the fill-in-blank method is not effective one-shot, where it always performs worse than the zero-shot setting. Perhaps this is because all models still require several examples to recognize the pattern.\n\nOne note of caution is that an analysis of test set contamination identified that a significant minority of the LAMBADA dataset appears to be present in our training data \u2013 however analysis performed in Section <ref> suggests negligible impact on performance.\n        \n        \n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 HellaSwag\n\n        \n        The HellaSwag dataset <cit.> involves picking the best ending to a story or set of instructions.  The examples were adversarially mined to be difficult for language models while remaining easy for humans (who achieve 95.6% accuracy).  GPT-3 achieves 78.1% accuracy in the one-shot setting and 79.3% accuracy in the few-shot setting, outperforming the 75.4% accuracy of a fine-tuned 1.5B parameter language model <cit.> but still a fair amount lower than the overall SOTA of 85.6% achieved by the fine-tuned multi-task model ALUM.\n\n        \n        \n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 StoryCloze\n\n        \n        We next evaluate GPT-3 on the StoryCloze 2016 dataset <cit.>, which involves selecting the correct ending sentence for five-sentence long stories.  Here GPT-3 achieves 83.2% in the zero-shot setting and 87.7% in the few-shot setting (with K=70). This is still 4.1% lower than the fine-tuned SOTA using a BERT based model <cit.> but improves over previous zero-shot results by roughly 10%.\n\n\n\n        \n        \n    \n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Closed Book Question Answering\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\nIn this section we measure GPT-3\u2019s ability to answer questions about broad factual knowledge. Due to the immense amount of possible queries, this task has normally been approached by using an information retrieval system to find relevant text in combination with a model which learns to generate an answer given the question and the retrieved text. Since this setting allows a system to search for and condition on text which potentially contains the answer it is denoted \u201copen-book\u201d. <cit.> recently demonstrated that a large language model can perform surprisingly well directly answering the questions without conditioning on auxilliary information. They denote this more restrictive evaluation setting as \u201cclosed-book\u201d.  Their work suggests that even higher-capacity models could perform even better and we test this hypothesis with GPT-3.   We evaluate GPT-3 on the 3 datasets in <cit.>: Natural Questions <cit.>, WebQuestions <cit.>, and TriviaQA <cit.>, using the same splits.  Note that in addition to all results being in the closed-book setting, our use of few-shot, one-shot, and zero-shot evaluations represent an even stricter setting than previous closed-book QA work: in addition to external content not being allowed, fine-tuning on the Q&A dataset itself is also not permitted.\n\nThe results for GPT-3 are shown in Table <ref>. On TriviaQA, we achieve 64.3% in the zero-shot setting, 68.0% in the one-shot setting, and 71.2% in the few-shot setting.  The zero-shot result already outperforms the fine-tuned T5-11B by 14.2%, and also outperforms a version with Q&A tailored span prediction during pre-training by 3.8%.  The one-shot result improves by 3.7% and matches the SOTA for an open-domain QA system which not only fine-tunes but also makes use of a learned retrieval mechanism over a 15.3B parameter dense vector index of 21M documents <cit.>. GPT-3's few-shot result further improves performance another 3.2% beyond this.\n\nOn WebQuestions (WebQs), GPT-3 achieves 14.4% in the zero-shot setting, 25.3% in the one-shot setting, and 41.5% in the few-shot setting.  This compares to 37.4% for fine-tuned T5-11B, and 44.7% for fine-tuned T5-11B+SSM, which uses a Q&A-specific pre-training procedure.  GPT-3 in the few-shot setting approaches the performance of state-of-the-art fine-tuned models.  Notably, compared to TriviaQA, WebQS shows a much larger gain from zero-shot to few-shot (and indeed its zero-shot and one-shot performance are poor), perhaps suggesting that the WebQs questions and/or the style of their answers are out-of-distribution for GPT-3.  Nevertheless, GPT-3 appears able to adapt to this distribution, recovering strong performance in the few-shot setting.\n\nOn Natural Questions (NQs) GPT-3 achieves 14.6% in the zero-shot setting, 23.0% in the one-shot setting, and 29.9% in the few-shot setting, compared to 36.6% for fine-tuned T5 11B+SSM.  Similar to WebQS, the large gain from zero-shot to few-shot may suggest a distribution shift, and may also explain the less competitive performance compared to TriviaQA and WebQS.  In particular, the questions in NQs tend towards very fine-grained knowledge on Wikipedia specifically which could be testing the limits of GPT-3's capacity and broad pretraining distribution.\n\nOverall, on one of the three datasets GPT-3's one-shot matches the open-domain fine-tuning SOTA. On the other two datasets it approaches the performance of the closed-book SOTA despite not using fine-tuning.  On all 3 datasets, we find that performance scales very smoothly with model size (Figure <ref> and Appendix <ref> Figure <ref>), possibly reflecting the idea that model capacity translates directly to more \u2018knowledge\u2019 absorbed in the parameters of the model.\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Translation\n\n    \n    \n\nFor GPT-2 a filter was used on a multilingual collection of documents to produce an English only dataset due to capacity concerns. Even with this filtering GPT-2 showed some evidence of multilingual capability and performed non-trivially when translating between French and English despite only training on 10 megabytes of remaining French text. Since we increase the capacity by over two orders of magnitude from GPT-2 to GPT-3, we also expand the scope of the training dataset to include more representation of other languages, though this remains an area for further improvement. As discussed in <ref> the majority of our data is derived from raw Common Crawl with only quality-based filtering. Although GPT-3's training data is still primarily English (93% by word count), it also includes 7% of text in other languages. These languages are documented in the https://github.com/openai/gpt-3supplemental material. In order to better understand translation capability, we also expand our analysis to include two additional commonly studied languages, German and Romanian.\n\nExisting unsupervised machine translation approaches often combine pretraining on a pair of monolingual datasets with back-translation <cit.> to bridge the two languages in a controlled way. By contrast, GPT-3 learns from a blend of training data that mixes many languages together in a natural way, combining them on a word, sentence, and document level. GPT-3 also uses a single training objective which is not customized or designed for any task in particular. However, our one / few-shot settings aren't strictly comparable to prior unsupervised work since they make use of a small amount of paired examples (1 or 64). This corresponds to up to a page or two of in-context training data. \n\n\n\n\n    \n\nResults are shown in Table <ref>. Zero-shot GPT-3, which only receives on a natural language description of the task, still underperforms recent unsupervised NMT results. However, providing only a single example demonstration for each translation task improves performance by over 7 BLEU and nears competitive performance with prior work. GPT-3 in the full few-shot setting further improves another 4 BLEU resulting in similar average performance to prior unsupervised NMT work. GPT-3 has a noticeable skew in its performance depending on language direction. For the three input languages studied, GPT-3 significantly outperforms prior unsupervised NMT work when translating into English but underperforms when translating in the other direction. Performance on En-Ro is a noticeable outlier at over 10 BLEU worse than prior unsupervised NMT work. This could be a weakness due to reusing the byte-level BPE tokenizer of GPT-2 which was developed for an almost entirely English training dataset. For both Fr-En and De-En, few shot GPT-3 outperforms the best supervised result we could find but due to our unfamiliarity with the literature and the appearance that these are un-competitive benchmarks we do not suspect those results represent true state of the art. For Ro-En, few shot GPT-3 performs within 0.5 BLEU of the overall SOTA which is achieved by a combination of unsupervised pretraining, supervised finetuning on 608K labeled examples, and backtranslation <cit.>.\n\nFinally, across all language pairs and across all three settings (zero-, one-, and few-shot), there is a smooth trend of improvement with model capacity.  This is shown in Figure <ref> in the case of few-shot results, and scaling for all three settings is shown in Appendix <ref>.\n\n\n    \n    \n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Winograd-Style Tasks\n\n    \n    \n\nThe Winograd Schemas Challenge <cit.> is a classical task in NLP that involves determining which word a pronoun refers to, when the pronoun is grammatically ambiguous but semantically unambiguous to a human.  Recently fine-tuned language models have achieved near-human performance on the original Winograd dataset, but more difficult versions such as the adversarially-mined Winogrande dataset <cit.> still significantly lag human performance.  We test GPT-3\u2019s performance on both Winograd and Winogrande, as usual in the zero-, one-, and few-shot setting.\n\nOn Winograd we test GPT-3 on the original set of 273 Winograd schemas, using the same \u201cpartial evaluation\u201d method described in <cit.>.  Note that this setting differs slightly from the WSC task in the SuperGLUE benchmark, which is presented as binary classification and requires entity extraction to convert to the form described in this section.  On Winograd GPT-3 achieves 88.3%, 89.7%, and 88.6% in the zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot settings, showing no clear in-context learning but in all cases achieving strong results just a few points below state-of-the-art and estimated human performance.  We note that contamination analysis found some Winograd schemas in the training data but this appears to have only a small effect on results (see Section <ref>).\n\nOn the more difficult Winogrande dataset, we do find gains to in-context learning: GPT-3 achieves 70.2% in the zero-shot setting, 73.2% in the one-shot setting, and 77.7% in the few-shot setting.  For comparison a fine-tuned RoBERTA model achieves 79%, state-of-the-art is 84.6% achieved with a fine-tuned high capacity model (T5), and human performance on the task as reported by <cit.> is 94.0%.\n\n\n    \n    \n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Common Sense Reasoning\n\n    \n    \n\n\nNext we consider three datasets which attempt to capture physical or scientific reasoning, as distinct from sentence completion, reading comprehension, or broad knowledge question answering. The first, PhysicalQA (PIQA) <cit.>, asks common sense questions about how the physical world works and is intended as a probe of grounded understanding of the world. GPT-3 achieves 81.0% accuracy zero-shot, 80.5% accuracy one-shot, and 82.8% accuracy few-shot (the last measured on PIQA's test server).  This compares favorably to the 79.4% accuracy prior state-of-the-art of a fine-tuned RoBERTa. PIQA shows relatively shallow scaling with model size and is still over 10% worse than human performance, but GPT-3's few-shot and even zero-shot result outperform the current state-of-the-art.  Our analysis flagged PIQA for a potential data contamination issue (despite hidden test labels), and we therefore conservatively mark the result with an asterisk. See Section <ref> for details.\n\nARC <cit.> is a dataset of multiple-choice questions collected from 3rd to 9th grade science exams. On the \u201cChallenge\u201d version of the dataset which has been filtered to questions which simple statistical or information retrieval methods are unable to  correctly answer, GPT-3 achieves 51.4% accuracy in the zero-shot setting, 53.2% in the one-shot setting, and 51.5% in the few-shot setting. This is approaching the performance of a fine-tuned RoBERTa baseline (55.9%) from UnifiedQA <cit.>. On the \u201cEasy\u201d version of the dataset (questions which either of the mentioned baseline approaches answered correctly), GPT-3 achieves 68.8%, 71.2%, and 70.1% which slightly exceeds a fine-tuned RoBERTa baseline from <cit.>. However, both of these results are still much worse than the overall SOTAs achieved by the UnifiedQA which exceeds GPT-3\u2019s few-shot results by 27% on the challenge set and 22% on the easy set.\n\nOn OpenBookQA <cit.>, GPT-3 improves significantly from zero to few shot settings but is still over 20 points short of the overall SOTA. GPT-3's few-shot performance is similar to a fine-tuned BERT Large baseline on the leaderboard.\n\nOverall, in-context learning with GPT-3 shows mixed results on commonsense reasoning tasks, with only small and inconsistent gains observed in the one and few-shot learning settings for both PIQA and ARC, but a significant improvement is observed on OpenBookQA. GPT-3 sets SOTA on the new PIQA dataset in all evaluation settings.\n\n\n    \n    \n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Reading Comprehension\n\n    \n    \n\nNext we evaluate GPT-3 on the task of reading comprehension. We use a suite of 5 datasets including abstractive, multiple choice, and span based answer formats in both dialog and single question settings. We observe a wide spread in GPT-3's performance across these datasets suggestive of varying capability with different answer formats. In general we observe GPT-3 is on par with initial baselines and early results trained using contextual representations on each respective dataset.\n\nGPT-3 performs best (within 3 points of the human baseline) on CoQA <cit.> a free-form conversational dataset and performs worst (13 F1 below an ELMo baseline) on QuAC <cit.> a dataset which requires modeling structured dialog acts and answer span selections of teacher-student interactions. On DROP <cit.>, a dataset testing discrete reasoning and numeracy in the context of reading comprehension, GPT-3 in a few-shot setting outperforms the fine-tuned BERT baseline from the original paper but is still well below both human performance and state-of-the-art approaches which augment neural networks with symbolic systems <cit.>. On SQuAD 2.0 <cit.>, GPT-3 demonstrates its few-shot learning capabilities, improving by almost 10 F1 (to 69.8) compared to a zero-shot setting. This allows it to slightly outperform the best fine-tuned result in the original paper. On RACE <cit.>, a multiple choice dataset of middle school and high school english examinations, GPT-3 performs relatively weakly and is only competitive with the earliest work utilizing contextual representations and is still 45% behind SOTA.\n\n\n    \n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 SuperGLUE\n\n    \n    In order to better aggregate results on NLP tasks and compare to popular models such as BERT and RoBERTa in a more systematic way, we also evaluate GPT-3 on a standardized collection of datasets, the SuperGLUE benchmark <cit.> <cit.> <cit.> <cit.> <cit.> <cit.> <cit.> <cit.> <cit.> <cit.> <cit.> <cit.> <cit.>. GPT-3\u2019s test-set performance on the SuperGLUE dataset is shown in Table <ref>.  In the few-shot setting, we used 32 examples for all tasks, sampled randomly from the training set. For all tasks except WSC and MultiRC, we sampled a new set of examples to use in the context for each problem. For WSC and MultiRC, we used the same set of randomly drawn examples from the training set as context for all of the problems we evaluated.\n\nWe observe a wide range in GPT-3\u2019s performance across tasks.  On COPA and ReCoRD GPT-3 achieves near-SOTA performance in the one-shot and few-shot settings, with COPA falling only a couple points short and achieving second place on the leaderboard, where first place is held by a fine-tuned 11 billion parameter model (T5). On WSC, performance is still relatively strong, achieving 80.1% in the few-shot setting (note that GPT-3 achieves 88.6% on the original Winograd dataset as described in Section <ref>).  On BoolQ, MultiRC, and RTE, performance is reasonable, roughly matching that of a fine-tuned BERT-Large. On CB, we see signs of life at 75.6% in the few-shot setting.\n\nWiC is a notable weak spot with few-shot performance at 49.4% (at random chance).  We tried a number of different phrasings and formulations for WiC (which involves determining if a word is being used with the same meaning in two sentences), none of which was able to achieve strong performance.  This hints at a phenomenon that will become clearer in the next section (which discusses the ANLI benchmark) \u2013 GPT-3 appears to be weak in the few-shot or one-shot setting at some tasks that involve comparing two sentences or snippets, for example whether a word is used the same way in two sentences (WiC), whether one sentence is a paraphrase of another, or whether one sentence implies another. This could also explain the comparatively low scores for RTE and CB, which also follow this format. Despite these weaknesses, GPT-3 still outperforms a fine-tuned BERT-large on four of eight tasks and on two tasks GPT-3 is close to the state-of-the-art held by a fine-tuned 11 billion parameter model.\n\nFinally, we note that the few-shot SuperGLUE score steadily improves with both model size and with number of examples in the context showing increasing benefits from in-context learning (Figure <ref>). We scale K up to 32 examples per task, after which point additional examples will not reliably fit into our context. When sweeping over values of K, we find that GPT-3 requires less than eight total examples per task to outperform a fine-tuned BERT-Large on overall SuperGLUE score.\n\n\n    \n    \n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 NLI\n\n    \n    Natural Language Inference (NLI) <cit.> concerns the ability to understand the relationship between two sentences. In practice, this task is usually structured as a two or three class classification problem where the model classifies whether the second sentence logically follows from the first, contradicts the first sentence, or is possibly true (neutral). SuperGLUE includes an NLI dataset, RTE, which evaluates the binary version of the task. On RTE, only the largest version of GPT-3 performs convincingly better than random (56%) in any evaluation setting, but in a few-shot setting GPT-3 performs similarly to a single-task fine-tuned BERT Large. We also evaluate on the recently introduced Adversarial Natural Language Inference (ANLI) dataset <cit.>. ANLI is a difficult dataset employing a series of adversarially mined natural language inference questions in three rounds (R1, R2, and R3). Similar to RTE, all of our models smaller than GPT-3 perform at almost exactly random chance on ANLI, even in the few-shot setting (\u223c33%), whereas GPT-3 itself shows signs of life on Round 3. Results for ANLI R3 are highlighted in Figure <ref> and full results for all rounds can be found in Appendix <ref>. These results on both RTE and ANLI suggest that NLI is still a very difficult task for language models and they are only just beginning to show signs of progress.\n\n    \n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Synthetic and Qualitative Tasks\n\n    \n    \nOne way to probe GPT-3\u2019s range of abilities in the few-shot (or zero- and one-shot) setting is to give it tasks which require it to perform simple on-the-fly computational reasoning, recognize a novel pattern that is unlikely to have occurred in training, or adapt quickly to an unusual task.  We devise several tasks to test this class of abilities.  First, we test GPT-3\u2019s ability to perform arithmetic.  Second, we create several tasks that involve rearranging or unscrambling the letters in a word, tasks which are unlikely to have been exactly seen during training.  Third, we test GPT-3\u2019s ability to solve SAT-style analogy problems few-shot.  Finally, we test GPT-3 on several qualitative tasks, including using new words in a sentence, correcting English grammar, and news article generation.  We will release the synthetic datasets with the hope of stimulating further study of test-time behavior of language models.\n    \n        \n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Arithmetic\n\n        \n        \nTo test GPT-3's ability to perform simple arithmetic operations without task-specific training, we developed a small battery of 10 tests that involve asking GPT-3 a simple arithmetic problem in natural language:\n\n\n    \n  * 2 digit addition (2D+) \u2013 The model is asked to add two integers sampled uniformly from [0, 100), phrased in the form of a question, e.g. \u201cQ: What is 48 plus 76? A: 124.\u201d\n    \n  * 2 digit subtraction (2D-) \u2013 The model is asked to subtract two integers sampled uniformly from [0, 100); the answer may be negative.  Example: \u201cQ: What is 34 minus 53? A: -19\u201d.\n    \n  * 3 digit addition (3D+) \u2013 Same as 2 digit addition, except numbers are uniformly sampled from [0, 1000).\n    \n  * 3 digit subtraction (3D-) \u2013 Same as 2 digit subtraction, except numbers are uniformly sampled from [0, 1000).\n    \n  * 4 digit addition (4D+) \u2013 Same as 3 digit addition, except uniformly sampled from [0, 10000).\n    \n  * 4 digit subtraction (4D-) \u2013 Same as 3 digit subtraction, except uniformly sampled from [0, 10000).\n    \n  * 5 digit addition (5D+) \u2013 Same as 3 digit addition, except uniformly sampled from [0, 100000).\n    \n  * 5 digit subtraction (5D-) \u2013 Same as 3 digit subtraction, except uniformly sampled from [0, 100000).\n   \n  * 2 digit multiplication (2Dx) \u2013 The model is asked to multiply two integers sampled uniformly from [0, 100), e.g. \u201cQ: What is 24 times 42? A: 1008\u201d.\n    \n  * One-digit composite (1DC) \u2013 The model is asked to perform a composite operation on three 1 digit numbers, with parentheses around the last two. For example, \u201cQ: What is 6+(4*8)? A: 38\u201d. The three 1 digit numbers are selected uniformly on [0, 10) and the operations are selected uniformly from {+,-,*}.\n\n\nIn all 10 tasks the model must generate the correct answer exactly. For each task we generate a dataset of 2,000 random instances of the task and evaluate all models on those instances.\n\nFirst we evaluate GPT-3 in the few-shot setting, for which results are shown in Figure <ref>.  On addition and subtraction, GPT-3 displays strong proficiency when the number of digits is small, achieving 100% accuracy on 2 digit addition, 98.9% at 2 digit subtraction, 80.2% at 3 digit addition, and 94.2% at 3-digit subtraction.  Performance decreases as the number of digits increases, but GPT-3 still achieves 25-26% accuracy on four digit operations and 9-10% accuracy on five digit operations, suggesting at least some capacity to generalize to larger numbers of digits.  GPT-3 also achieves 29.2% accuracy at 2 digit multiplication, an especially computationally intensive operation. Finally, GPT-3 achieves 21.3% accuracy at single digit combined operations (for example, 9*(7+5)), suggesting that it has some robustness beyond just single operations.\n\n\n\n\nAs Figure <ref> makes clear, small models do poorly on all of these tasks \u2013 even the 13 billion parameter model (the second largest after the 175 billion full GPT-3) can solve 2 digit addition and subtraction only half the time, and all other operations less than 10% of the time.\n\nOne-shot and zero-shot performance are somewhat degraded relative to few-shot performance, suggesting that adaptation to the task (or at the very least recognition of the task) is important to performing these computations correctly.  Nevertheless, one-shot performance is still quite strong, and even zero-shot performance of the full GPT-3 significantly outperforms few-shot learning for all smaller models.  All three settings for the full GPT-3 are shown in Table <ref>, and model capacity scaling for all three settings is shown in Appendix <ref>.\n\nTo spot-check whether the model is simply memorizing specific arithmetic problems, we took the 3-digit arithmetic problems in our test set and searched for them in our training data in both the forms  and .  Out of 2,000 addition problems we found only 17 matches (0.8%) and out of 2,000 subtraction problems we found only 2 matches (0.1%), suggesting that only a trivial fraction of the correct answers could have been memorized.  In addition, inspection of incorrect answers reveals that the model often makes mistakes such as not carrying a \u201c1\u201d, suggesting it is actually attempting to perform the relevant computation rather than memorizing a table.\n\nOverall, GPT-3 displays reasonable proficiency at moderately complex arithmetic in few-shot, one-shot, and even zero-shot settings.\n\n\n        \n        \n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Word Scrambling and Manipulation Tasks\n\n        \n        \nTo test GPT-3's ability to learn novel symbolic manipulations from a few examples, we designed a small battery of 5 \u201ccharacter manipulation\u201d tasks.  Each task involves giving the model a word distorted by some combination of scrambling, addition, or deletion of characters, and asking it to recover the original word.  The 5 tasks are:\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n  * Cycle letters in word (CL) \u2013 The model is given a word with its letters cycled, then the \u201c=\u201d symbol, and is expected to generate the original word.  For example, it might be given \u201clyinevitab\u201d and should output \u201cinevitably\u201d.\n    \n  * Anagrams of all but first and last characters (A1) \u2013 The model is given a word where every letter except the first and last have been scrambled randomly, and must output the original word.  Example: criroptuon = corruption.\n    \n  * Anagrams of all but first and last 2 characters (A2) \u2013 The model is given a word where every letter except the first 2 and last 2 have been scrambled randomly, and must recover the original word.  Example: opoepnnt \u2192 opponent.\n    \n  * Random insertion in word (RI) \u2013 A random punctuation or space character is inserted between each letter of a word, and the model must output the original word.  Example: s.u!c/c!e.s s i/o/n = succession.\n    \n  * Reversed words (RW) \u2013 The model is given a word spelled backwards, and must output the original word.  Example: stcejbo \u2192 objects.\n\n\nFor each task we generate 10,000 examples, which we chose to be the top 10,000 most frequent words as measured by <cit.> of length more than 4 characters and less than 15 characters. The few-shot results are shown in Figure <ref>.  Task performance tends to grow smoothly with model size, with the full GPT-3 model achieving 66.9% on removing random insertions, 38.6% on cycling letters, 40.2% on the easier anagram task, and 15.1% on the more difficult anagram task (where only the first and last letters are held fixed).  None of the models can reverse the letters in a word. \n\nIn the one-shot setting, performance is significantly weaker (dropping by half or more), and in the zero-shot setting the model can rarely perform any of the tasks (Table <ref>).  This suggests that the model really does appear to learn these tasks at test time, as the model cannot perform them zero-shot and their artificial nature makes them unlikely to appear in the pre-training data (although we cannot confirm this with certainty).\n\nWe can further quantify performance by plotting \u201cin-context learning curves\u201d, which show task performance as a function of the number of in-context examples.  We show in-context learning curves for the Symbol Insertion task in Figure <ref>.  We can see that larger models are able to make increasingly effective use of in-context information, including both task examples and natural language task descriptions.\n\nFinally, it is worth adding that solving these tasks requires character-level manipulations, whereas our BPE encoding operates on significant fractions of a word (on average \u223c0.7 words per token), so from the LM\u2019s perspective succeeding at these tasks involves not just manipulating BPE tokens but understanding and pulling apart their substructure. Also, CL, A1, and A2 are not bijective (that is, the unscrambled word is not a deterministic function of the scrambled word), requiring the model to perform some search to find the correct unscrambling. Thus, the skills involved appear to require non-trivial pattern-matching and computation.\n\n        \n        \n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 SAT Analogies\n\n        \n        To test GPT-3 on another task that is somewhat unusual relative to the typical distribution of text, we collected a set of 374 \u201cSAT analogy\u201d problems <cit.>.  Analogies are a style of multiple choice question that constituted a section of the SAT college entrance exam before 2005.  A typical example is \u201caudacious is to boldness as (a) sanctimonious is to hypocrisy, (b) anonymous is to identity, (c) remorseful is to misdeed, (d) deleterious is to result, (e) impressionable is to temptation\u201d.  The student is expected to choose which of the five word pairs has the same relationship as the original word pair; in this example the answer is \u201csanctimonious is to hypocrisy\u201d.  On this task GPT-3 achieves 65.2% in the few-shot setting, 59.1% in the one-shot setting, and 53.7% in the zero-shot setting, whereas the average score among college applicants was 57% <cit.>  (random guessing yields 20%).  As shown in Figure <ref>, the results improve with scale, with the the full 175 billion model improving by over 10% compared to the 13 billion parameter model.\n\n\n        \n        \n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 News Article Generation\n\n        \n        Previous work on generative language models qualitatively tested their ability to generate synthetic \u201cnews articles\u201d by conditional sampling from the model given a human-written prompt consisting of a plausible first sentence for a news story <cit.>.  Relative to <cit.>, the dataset used to train GPT-3 is much less weighted towards news articles, so trying to generate news articles via raw unconditional samples is less effective \u2013 for example GPT-3 often interprets the proposed first sentence of a \u201cnews article\u201d as a tweet and then posts synthetic responses or follow-up tweets.  To solve this problem we employed GPT-3\u2019s few-shot learning abilities by providing three previous news articles in the model\u2019s context to condition it.  With the title and subtitle of a proposed next article, the model is able to reliably generate short articles in the \u201cnews\u201d genre.\n\nTo gauge the quality of news article generation from GPT-3 (which we believe is likely to be correlated with conditional sample generation quality in general), we decided to measure human ability to distinguish GPT-3-generated articles from real ones. Similar work has been carried out by Kreps et al. <cit.> and Zellers et al. <cit.>. Generative language models are trained to match the distribution of content generated by humans, so the (in)ability of humans to distinguish the two is a potentially important measure of quality.[This task is also relevant to the potential misuse of language models discussed in Section <ref>.] \n\nIn order to see how well humans can detect model generated text, we arbitrarily selected 25 article titles and subtitles from the website newser.comnewser.com (mean length: 215 words). We then generated completions of these titles and subtitles from four language models ranging in size from 125M to 175B (GPT-3) parameters (mean length: 200 words). For each model, we presented around 80 US-based participants with a quiz consisting of these real titles and subtitles followed by either the human written article or the article generated by the model[We wanted to identify how good an average person on the internet is at detecting language model outputs, so we focused on participants drawn from the general US population. See Appendix <ref> for details.]. Participants were asked to select whether the article was \u201cvery likely written by a human\u201d, \u201cmore likely written by a human\u201d, \u201cI don't know\u201d, \u201cmore likely written by a machine\u201d, or \u201cvery likely written by a machine\u201d.\n\nThe articles we selected were not in the models\u2019 training data and the model outputs were formatted and selected programmatically to prevent human cherry-picking. All models used the same context to condition outputs on and were pre-trained with the same context size and the same article titles and subtitles were used as prompts for each model. However, we also ran an experiment to control for participant effort and attention that followed the same format but involved intentionally bad model generated articles. This was done by generating articles from a \u201ccontrol model\u201d: a 160M parameter model with no context and increased output randomness.\n\nMean human accuracy (the ratio of correct assignments to non-neutral assignments per participant) at detecting that the intentionally bad articles were model generated was  \u223c86%  where 50% is chance level performance. By contrast, mean human accuracy at detecting articles that were produced by the 175B parameter model was barely above chance at \u223c52% (see Table <ref>).[We use a two-sample Student\u2019s T-Test to test for significant difference between the means of the participant accuracies of each model and the control model and report the normalized difference in the means (as the t-statistic) and the p-value.] Human abilities to detect model generated text appear to decrease as model size increases: there appears to be a trend towards chance accuracy with model size, and human detection of GPT-3 is close to chance.[If a model consistently produces texts that are more impressive than human articles, it is possible that human performance on this task would drop below 50%. Indeed, many individual participants scored below 50% on this task.] This is true despite the fact that participants spend more time on each output as model size increases (see Appendix <ref>).\n\n\n\n\n Examples of synthetic articles from GPT-3 are given in Figures <ref> and <ref>.[Additional non-news samples can be found in Appendix <ref>.] Much of the text is\u2014as indicated by the evaluations\u2014difficult for humans to distinguish from authentic human content. Factual inaccuracies can be an indicator that an article is model generated since, unlike human authors, the models have no access to the specific facts that the article titles refer to or when the article was written. Other indicators include repetition, non sequiturs, and unusual phrasings, though these are often subtle enough that they are not noticed. \n \n\n\n\n \n Related work on language model detection by Ippolito et al. <cit.> indicates that automatic discriminators like Grover <cit.> and GLTR <cit.> may have greater success at detecting model generated text than human evaluators. Automatic detection of these models may be a promising area of future research.\n \nIppolito et al. <cit.> also note that human accuracy at detecting model generated text increases as humans observe more tokens. To do a preliminary investigation of how good humans are at detecting longer news articles generated by GPT-3 175B, we selected 12 world news articles from Reuters with an average length of 569 words and generated completions of these articles from GPT-3 with an average length of 498 words (298 words longer than our initial experiments). Following the methodology above, we ran two experiments, each on around 80 US-based participants, to compare human abilities to detect the articles generated by GPT-3 and a control model.\n \n We found that mean human accuracy at detecting the intentionally bad longer articles from the control model was \u223c88%, while mean human accuracy at detecting the longer articles that were produced by GPT-3 175B was still barely above chance at \u223c52% (see Table <ref>). This indicates that, for news articles that are around 500 words long, GPT-3 continues to produce articles that humans find difficult to distinguish from human written news articles.\n \n \n\n        \n\n        \n        \n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Learning and Using Novel Words\n\n        \n        A task studied in developmental linguistics <cit.> is the ability to learn and utilize new words, for example using a word in a sentence after seeing it defined only once, or conversely inferring a word\u2019s meaning from only one usage.  Here we qualitatively test GPT-3\u2019s ability to do the former.  Specifically, we give GPT-3 the definition of a nonexistent word, such as \u201cGigamuru\u201d, and then ask it to use it in a sentence.  We provide one to five previous examples of a (separate) nonexistent word being defined and used in a sentence, so the task is few-shot in terms of previous examples of the broad task and one-shot in terms of the specific word.  Table <ref> shows the 6 examples we generated; all definitions were human-generated, and the first answer was human-generated as conditioning while the subsequent answers were generated by GPT-3.  These examples were generated continuously in one sitting and we did not omit or repeatedly try any prompts.  In all cases the generated sentence appears to be a correct or at least plausible use of the word.  In the final sentence the model generates a plausible conjugation for the word \u201cscreeg\u201d (namely \u201cscreeghed\u201d), although the use of the word is slightly awkward (\u201cscreeghed at each other\u201d) despite being plausible in the sense that it could describe a toy sword fight.  Overall, GPT-3 appears to be at least proficient at the task of using novel words in a sentence.\n\n\n        \n        \n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Correcting English Grammar\n\n        \n        Another task well suited for few-shot learning is correcting English grammar.  We test this with GPT-3 in the few-shot setting by giving prompts of the form .  We give GPT-3 one human-generated correction and then ask it to correct 5 more (again without any omissions or repeats).  Results are shown in Figure <ref>.Since our training dataset is sourced from the internet, it is possible that our model was trained on some of our benchmark test sets.  Accurately detecting test contamination from internet-scale datasets is a new area of research without established best practices. While it is common practice to train large models without investigating contamination, given the increasing scale of pretraining datasets, we believe this issue is becoming increasingly important to attend to.\n\nThis concern is not just hypothetical. One of the first papers to train a language model on Common Crawl data <cit.> detected and removed a training document which overlapped with one of their evaluation datasets. Other work such as GPT-2 <cit.> also conducted post-hoc overlap analysis. Their study was relatively encouraging, finding that although models did perform moderately better on data that overlapped between training and testing, this did not significantly impact reported results due to the small fraction of data which was contaminated (often only a few percent).\n\nGPT-3 operates in a somewhat different regime.  On the one hand, the dataset and model size are about two orders of magnitude larger than those used for GPT-2, and include a large amount of Common Crawl, creating increased potential for contamination and memorization.  On the other hand, precisely due to the large amount of data, even GPT-3 175B does not overfit its training set by a significant amount, measured relative to a held-out validation set with which it was deduplicated (Figure <ref>).  Thus, we expect that contamination is likely to be frequent, but that its effects may not be as large as feared.\n\nWe initially tried to address the issue of contamination by proactively searching for and attempting to remove any overlap between our training data and the development and test sets of all benchmarks studied in this paper. Unfortunately, a bug resulted in only partial removal of all detected overlaps from the training data. Due to the cost of training, it wasn't feasible to retrain the model. To address this, we investigate in detail how the remaining detected overlap impacts results.\n\nFor each benchmark, we produce a `clean' version which removes all potentially leaked examples, defined roughly as examples that have a 13-gram overlap with anything in the pretraining set (or that overlap with the whole example when it is shorter than 13-grams). The goal is to very conservatively flag anything that could potentially be contamination, so as to produce a clean subset that is free of contamination with high confidence. The exact procedure is detailed in Appendix <ref>.\n\nWe then evaluate GPT-3 on these clean benchmarks, and compare to the original score.  If the score on the clean subset is similar to the score on the entire dataset, this suggests that contamination, even if present, does not have a significant effect on reported results.  If the score on the clean subset is lower, this suggests contamination may be inflating the results. The results are summarized in Figure <ref>.  Although potential contamination is often high (with a quarter of benchmarks scoring over 50%), in most cases performance changes only negligibly, and we see no evidence that contamination level and performance difference are correlated.  We conclude that either our conservative method substantially overestimated contamination or that contamination has little effect on performance.\n\nBelow, we review in more detail the few specific cases where either (1) the model performs significantly worse on the cleaned version, or (2) potential contamination is very high, which makes measuring the performance difference difficult.\n\n\n\nOur analysis flagged six groups of benchmarks for further investigation: Word Scrambling, Reading Comprehension (QuAC, SQuAD2, DROP), PIQA, Winograd, language modeling tasks (Wikitext tasks, 1BW), and German to English translation. Since our overlap analysis is designed to be extremely conservative, we expect it to produce some false positives. We summarize the results for each group of tasks below:\n\n    \n  * Reading Comprehension: Our initial analysis flagged >90% of task examples from QuAC, SQuAD2, and DROP as potentially contaminated, so large that even measuring the differential on a clean subset was difficult. Upon manual inspection, however, we found that for every overlap we inspected, in all 3 datasets, the source text was present in our training data but the question/answer pairs were not, meaning the model gains only background information and cannot memorize the answer to a specific question.\n    \n  * German translation: We found 25% of the examples in the WMT16 German-English test set were marked as potentially contaminated, with an associated total effect size of 1-2 BLEU.  Upon inspection, none of the flagged examples contain paired sentences resembling NMT training data and collisions were monolingual matches mostly of snippets of events discussed in the news.\n    \n  * Reversed Words and Anagrams: Recall that these tasks are of the form \u201c\". Due to the short length of these tasks, we used 2-grams for filtering (ignoring punctuation). After inspecting the flagged overlaps, we found that they were not typically instances of real reversals or unscramblings in the training set, but rather palindromes or trivial unscramblings, e.g \u201c\". The amount of overlap was small, but removing the trivial tasks lead to an increase in difficulty and thus a spurious signal.  Related to this, the symbol insertion task shows high overlap but no effect on performance \u2013 this is because that task involves removing non-letter characters from a word, and the overlap analysis itself ignores such characters, leading to many spurious matches.\n    \n  * PIQA: The overlap analysis flagged 29% of examples as contaminated, and observed a 3 percentage point absolute decrease (4% relative decrease) in performance on the clean subset. Though the test dataset was released after our training set was created and its labels are hidden, some of the web pages used by the crowdsourced dataset creators are contained in our training set. We found a similar decrease in a 25x smaller model with much less capacity to memorize, leading us to suspect that the shift is likely statistical bias rather than memorization; examples which workers copied may simply be easier. Unfortunately, we cannot rigorously prove this hypothesis.  We therefore mark our PIQA results with an asterisk to denote this potential contamination.\n    \n  * Winograd: The overlap analysis flagged 45% of examples, and found a 2.6% decrease in performance on the clean subset. Manual inspection of the overlapping data point showed that 132 Winograd schemas were in fact present in our training set, though presented in a different format than we present the task to the model. Although the decrease in performance is small, we mark our Winograd results in the main paper with an asterisk.\n    \n  * Language modeling: We found the 4 Wikipedia language modeling benchmarks measured in GPT-2, plus the Children's Book Test dataset, to be almost entirely contained in our training data.  Since we cannot reliably extract a clean subset here, we do not report results on these datasets, even though we intended to when starting this work. We note that Penn Tree Bank due to its age was unaffected and therefore became our chief language modeling benchmark.\n\n\nWe also inspected datasets where contamination was high, but the impact on performance was close to zero, simply to verify how much actual contamination existed.  These appeared to often contain false positives. They had either no actual contamination, or had contamination that did not give away the answer to the task. One notable exception was LAMBADA, which appeared to have substantial genuine contamination, yet the impact on performance was very small, with the clean subset scoring within 0.5% of the full dataset.  Also, strictly speaking, our fill-in-the-blank format precludes the simplest form of memorization.  Nevertheless, since we made very large gains on LAMBADA in this paper, the potential contamination is noted in the results section.\n\nAn important limitation of our contamination analysis is that we cannot be sure that the clean subset is drawn from the same distribution as the original dataset.  It remains possible that memorization inflates results but at the same time is precisely counteracted by some statistical bias causing the clean subset to be easier.  However, the sheer number of shifts close to zero suggests this is unlikely, and we also observed no noticeable difference in the shifts for small models, which are unlikely to be memorizing.\n\nOverall, we have made a best effort to measure and document the effects of data contamination, and to note or outright remove problematic results, depending on the severity.  Much work remains to be done to address this important and subtle issue for the field in general, both when designing benchmarks and when training models. For a more detailed explanation of our analysis, we refer the reader to Appendix <ref>.GPT-3 and our analysis of it have a number of limitations.  Below we describe some of these and suggest directions for future work.\n\nFirst, despite the strong quantitative and qualitative improvements of GPT-3, particularly compared to its direct predecessor GPT-2, it still has notable weaknesses in text synthesis and several NLP tasks.  On text synthesis, although the overall quality is high, GPT-3 samples still sometimes repeat themselves semantically at the document level, start to lose coherence over sufficiently long passages, contradict themselves, and occasionally contain non-sequitur sentences or paragraphs.  We will release a collection of 500 uncurated unconditional samples to help provide a better sense of GPT-3\u2019s limitations and strengths at text synthesis. Within the domain of discrete language tasks, we have noticed informally that GPT-3 seems to have special difficulty with \u201ccommon sense physics\u201d, despite doing well on some datasets (such as PIQA <cit.>) that test this domain.  Specifically GPT-3 has difficulty with questions of the type \u201cIf I put cheese into the fridge, will it melt?\u201d.  Quantitatively, GPT-3\u2019s in-context learning performance has some notable gaps on our suite of benchmarks, as described in Section <ref>, and in particular it does little better than chance when evaluated one-shot or even few-shot on some \u201ccomparison\u201d tasks, such as determining if two words are used the same way in a sentence, or if one sentence implies another (WIC and ANLI respectively), as well as on a subset of reading comprehension tasks.  This is especially striking given GPT-3\u2019s strong few-shot performance on many other tasks.\n\nGPT-3 has several structural and algorithmic limitations, which could account for some of the issues above. We focused on exploring in-context learning behavior in autoregressive language models because it is straightforward to both sample and compute likelihoods with this model class. As a result our experiments do not include any bidirectional architectures or other training objectives such as denoising. This is a noticeable difference from much of the recent literature, which has documented improved fine-tuning performance when using these approaches over standard language models\u00a0<cit.>. Thus our design decision comes at the cost of potentially worse performance on tasks which empirically benefit from bidirectionality. This may include fill-in-the-blank tasks, tasks that involve looking back and comparing two pieces of content, or tasks that require re-reading or carefully considering a long passage and then generating a very short answer.  This could be a possible explanation for GPT-3's lagging few-shot performance on a few of the tasks, such as WIC (which involves comparing the use of a word in two sentences), ANLI (which involves comparing two sentences to see if one implies the other), and several reading comprehension tasks (e.g. QuAC and RACE).  We also conjecture, based on past literature, that a large bidirectional model would be stronger at fine-tuning than GPT-3. Making a bidirectional model at the scale of GPT-3, and/or trying to make bidirectional models work with few- or zero-shot learning, is a promising direction for future research, and could help achieve the \u201cbest of both worlds\u201d.\n\nA more fundamental limitation of the general approach described in this paper \u2013 scaling up any LM-like model, whether autoregressive or bidirectional \u2013 is that it may eventually run into (or could already be running into) the limits of the pretraining objective. Our current objective weights every token equally and lacks a notion of what is most important to predict and what is less important. <cit.> demonstrate benefits of customizing prediction to entities of interest. Also, with self-supervised objectives, task specification relies on forcing the desired task into a prediction problem, whereas ultimately, useful language systems (for example virtual assistants) might be better thought of as taking goal-directed actions rather than just making predictions.  Finally, large pretrained language models are not grounded in other domains of experience, such as video or real-world physical interaction, and thus lack a large amount of context about the world <cit.>.  For all these reasons, scaling pure self-supervised prediction is likely to hit limits, and augmentation with a different approach is likely to be necessary.  Promising future directions in this vein might include learning the objective function from humans <cit.>, fine-tuning with reinforcement learning, or adding additional modalities such as images to provide grounding and a better model of the world <cit.>.\n\nAnother limitation broadly shared by language models is poor sample efficiency during pre-training.  While GPT-3 takes a step towards test-time sample efficiency closer to that of humans (one-shot or zero-shot), it still sees much more text during pre-training than a human sees in the their lifetime <cit.>.  Improving pre-training sample efficiency is an important direction for future work, and might come from  grounding in the physical world to provide additional information, or from algorithmic improvements. \n\nA limitation, or at least uncertainty, associated with few-shot learning in GPT-3 is ambiguity about whether few-shot learning actually learns new tasks \u201cfrom scratch\u201d at inference time, or if it simply recognizes and identifies tasks that it has learned during training.  These possibilities exist on a spectrum, ranging from demonstrations in the training set that are drawn from exactly the same distribution as those at test time, to recognizing the same task but in a different format, to adapting to a specific style of a general task such as QA, to learning a skill entirely de novo.  Where GPT-3 is on this spectrum may also vary from task to task.  Synthetic tasks such as wordscrambling or defining nonsense words seem especially likely to be learned de novo, whereas translation clearly must be learned during pretraining, although possibly from data that is very different in organization and style than the test data. Ultimately, it is not even clear what humans learn from scratch vs from prior demonstrations.  Even organizing diverse demonstrations during pre-training and identifying them at test time would be an advance for language models, but nevertheless understanding precisely how few-shot learning works is an important unexplored direction for future research. \n\nA limitation associated with models at the scale of GPT-3, regardless of objective function or algorithm, is that they are both expensive and inconvenient to perform inference on, which may present a challenge for practical applicability of models of this scale in their current form.  One possible future direction to address this is distillation <cit.> of large models down to a manageable size for specific tasks. Large models such as GPT-3 contain a very wide range of skills, most of which are not needed for a specific task, suggesting that in principle aggressive distillation may be possible.  Distillation is well-explored in general <cit.> but has not been tried at the scale of hundred of billions parameters; new challenges and opportunities may be associated with applying it to models of this size.\n\nFinally, GPT-3 shares some limitations common to most deep learning systems \u2013 its decisions are not easily interpretable, it is not necessarily well-calibrated in its predictions on novel inputs as observed by the much higher variance in performance than humans on standard benchmarks, and it retains the biases of the data it has been trained on.  This last issue \u2013 biases in the data that may lead the model to generate stereotyped or prejudiced content \u2013 is of special concern from a societal perspective, and will be discussed along with other issues in the next section on Broader Impacts (Section <ref>).Language models have a wide range of beneficial applications for society,  including code and writing auto-completion, grammar assistance, game narrative generation, improving search engine responses, and answering questions. But they also have potentially harmful applications. GPT-3 improves the quality of text generation and adaptability over smaller models and increases the difficulty of distinguishing synthetic text from human-written text. It therefore has the potential to advance both the beneficial and harmful applications of language models.\n\nHere we focus on the potential harms of improved language models, not because we believe the harms are necessarily greater, but in order to stimulate efforts to study and mitigate them.  The broader impacts of language models like this are numerous. We focus on two primary issues: the potential for deliberate misuse of language models like GPT-3 in Section <ref>, and issues of bias, fairness, and representation within models like GPT-3 in Section <ref>.  We also briefly discuss issues of energy efficiency (Section <ref>).\n \n\n\n    \n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Misuse of Language Models\n\n    \n    Malicious uses of language models can be somewhat difficult to anticipate because they often involve repurposing language models in a very different environment or for a different purpose than researchers intended. To help with this, we can think in terms of traditional security risk assessment frameworks, which outline key steps such as identifying threats and potential impacts, assessing likelihood, and determining risk as a combination of likelihood and impact <cit.>.  We discuss three factors: potential misuse applications, threat actors, and external incentive structures. \n\n        \n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Potential Misuse Applications\n\n        \n        Any socially harmful activity that relies on generating text could be augmented by powerful language models. Examples include misinformation, spam, phishing, abuse of legal and governmental processes, fraudulent academic essay writing and social engineering pretexting. Many of these applications bottleneck on human beings to write sufficiently high quality text. Language models that produce high quality text generation could lower existing barriers to carrying out these activities and increase their efficacy.\n\nThe misuse potential of language models increases as the quality of text synthesis improves. The ability of GPT-3 to generate several paragraphs of synthetic content that people find difficult to distinguish from human-written text in <ref> represents a concerning milestone in this regard.\n    \n        \n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Threat Actor Analysis\n\n        \n        Threat actors can be organized by skill and resource levels, ranging from low or moderately skilled and resourced actors who may be able to build a malicious product to `advanced persistent threats' (APTs): highly skilled and well-resourced (e.g. state-sponsored) groups with long-term agendas <cit.>.\n\nTo understand how low and mid-skill actors think about language models, we have been monitoring forums and chat groups where misinformation tactics, malware distribution, and computer fraud are frequently discussed. While we did find significant discussion of misuse following the initial release of GPT-2 in spring of 2019, we found fewer instances of experimentation and no successful deployments since then. Additionally, those misuse discussions were correlated with media coverage of language model technologies. From this, we assess that the threat of misuse from these actors is not immediate, but significant improvements in reliability could change this.\n\nBecause APTs do not typically discuss operations in the open, we have consulted with professional threat analysts about possible APT activity involving the use of language models. Since the release of GPT-2 there has been no discernible difference in operations that may see potential gains by using language models. The assessment was that language models may not be worth investing significant resources in because there has been no convincing demonstration that current language models are significantly better than current methods for generating text, and because methods for \u201ctargeting\u201d or \u201ccontrolling\u201d the content of language models are still at a very early stage.\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 External Incentive Structures\n\n        \n        Each threat actor group also has a set of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that they rely on to accomplish their agenda. TTPs are influenced by economic factors like scalability and ease of deployment; phishing is extremely popular among all groups because it offers a low-cost, low-effort, high-yield method of deploying malware and stealing login credentials. Using language models to augment existing TTPs would likely result in an even lower cost of deployment.\n\nEase of use is another significant incentive. Having stable infrastructure has a large impact on the adoption of TTPs. The outputs of language models are stochastic, however, and though developers can constrain these (e.g. using top-k truncation) they are not able to perform consistently without human feedback. If a social media disinformation bot produces outputs that are reliable 99% of the time, but produces incoherent outputs 1% of the time, this could reduce the amount of human labor required in operating this bot. But a human is still needed to filter the outputs, which restricts how scalable the operation can be.\n\nBased on our analysis of this model and analysis of threat actors and the landscape, we suspect AI researchers will eventually develop language models that are sufficiently consistent and steerable that they will be of greater interest to malicious actors. We expect this will introduce challenges for the broader research community, and hope to work on this through a combination of mitigation research, prototyping, and coordinating with other technical developers. \n\n\n    \n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Fairness, Bias, and Representation\n\n    \n     Biases present in training data may lead models to generate stereotyped or prejudiced content. This is concerning, since model bias could harm people in the relevant groups in different ways by entrenching existing stereotypes and producing demeaning portrayals amongst other potential harms\u00a0<cit.>. We have conducted an analysis of biases in the model in order to better understand GPT-3\u2019s limitations when it comes to fairness, bias, and representation. [Evaluating fairness, bias, and representation in language models is a rapidly-developing area with a large body of prior work. See, for example, <cit.>.]\n \n\nOur goal is not to exhaustively characterize GPT-3, but to give a preliminary analysis of some of its limitations and behaviors. We focus on biases relating to gender, race, and religion, although many other categories of bias are likely present and could be studied in follow-up work. This is a preliminary analysis and does not reflect all of the model's biases even within the studied categories.\n\nBroadly, our analysis indicates that internet-trained models have internet-scale biases; models tend to reflect stereotypes present in their training data.  Below we discuss our preliminary findings of bias along the dimensions of gender, race, and religion. We probe for bias in the 175 billion parameter model and also in similar smaller models, to see if and how they are different in this dimension.\n\n\n    \n        \n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Gender\n\n        \n        In our investigation of gender bias in GPT-3, we focused on associations between gender and occupation. We found that occupations in general have a higher probability of being followed by a male gender identifier than a female one (in other words, they are male leaning) when given a context such as  (Neutral Variant). 83% of the 388 occupations we tested were more likely to be followed by a male identifier by GPT-3. We measured this by feeding the model a context such as  and then looking at the probability of the model following up with male indicating words (eg. man, male etc.) or female indicating words (woman, female etc.). In particular, occupations demonstrating higher levels of education such as legislator, banker, or professor emeritus were heavily male leaning along with occupations that require hard physical labour such as mason, millwright, and sheriff. Occupations that were more likely to be followed by female identifiers include midwife, nurse, receptionist, housekeeper etc.\n\nWe also tested how these probabilities changed when we shifted the context to be the  (Competent Variant), and when we shifted the context to be  (Incompetent Variant) for each occupation in the dataset. We found that, when prompted with   the majority of occupations had an even higher probability of being followed by a male identifier than a female one than was the case with our original neutral prompt, . With the prompt  the majority of occupations still leaned male with a similar probability than for our original neutral prompt. The average occupation bias - measured as 1/n_jobs\u2211_jobslog( P(female|Context)/P(male|Context))) -  was -1.11 for the Neutral Variant, -2.14  for the Competent Variant and -1.15 for the Incompetent Variant.\n\n\nWe also carried out pronoun resolution on the Winogender dataset <cit.> using two methods which further corroborated the model's tendency to associate most occupations with males. One method measured the models ability to correctly assign a pronoun as the occupation or the participant. For example, we fed the model a context such as  and found the option with the lowest probability between the two possible options (Choices between Occupation Option: advisor; Participant Option: advisee).\n\nOccupation and participant words often have societal biases associated with them such as the assumption that most occupants are by default male. We found that the language models learnt some of these biases such as a tendency to associate female pronouns with participant positions more than male pronouns. GPT-3 175B had the highest accuracy of all the models (64.17%) on this task. It was also the only model where the accuracy for Occupant sentences (sentences where the correct answer was the Occupation option) for females was higher than for males (81.7% vs 76.7%). All other models had a higher accuracy for male pronouns with Occupation sentences as compared to female pronouns with the exception of our second largest model- GPT-3 13B - which had the same accuracy (60%) for both. This offers some preliminary evidence that in places where issues of bias can make language models susceptible to error, the larger models are more robust than smaller models.\n\nWe also performed co-occurrence tests, where we analyzed which words are likely to occur in the vicinity of other pre-selected words. We created a model output sample set by generating 800 outputs of length 50 each with a temperature of 1 and top_p of 0.9 for every prompt in our dataset. For gender, we had prompts such as , , , [We  only  used  male  and  female  pronouns. This simplifying assumption makes it easier to study co-occurrence since it does not require the isolation of instances in which \u2018they\u2019 refers to a singular noun from those where it didn\u2019t, but other forms of gender bias are likely present and could be studied using different approaches.]. We looked at the adjectives and adverbs in the top 100 most favored words using an off-the-shelf POS tagger <cit.>. We found females were more often described using appearance oriented words such as \"beautiful\" and \"gorgeous\" as compared to men who were more often described using adjectives that span a greater spectrum. \n\nTable <ref> shows the top 10 most favored descriptive words for the model along with the raw number of times each word co-occurred with a pronoun indicator. \u201cMost Favored\u201d here indicates words which were most skewed towards a category by co-occurring with it at a higher rate as compared to the other category.  To put these numbers in perspective, we have also included the average for the number of co-occurrences across all qualifying words for each gender.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n        \n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Race\n\n        \n        To investigate racial bias in GPT-3, we seeded the model with prompts such as - ,  and  and generated 800 samples for each of the above prompts, with  replaced with a term indicating a racial category such as White or Asian. We then measure word co-occurrences in the generated samples. Given prior research demonstrating that language models produce text of differing sentiment when varying features such as occupation <cit.>, we explored how race impacted sentiment. We measured sentiment using Senti WordNet <cit.> for the words which co-occurred disproportionately with each race. Each word sentiment varied from 100 to -100, with positive scores indicating positive words (eg. wonderfulness: 100, amicable: 87.5), negative scores indicating negative words (eg. wretched: -87.5 , horrid: -87.5) and a score of 0 indicating neutral words (eg. sloping, chalet).\n\nIt should be noted that we were explicitly prompting the models to talk about race and this in turn generated text that focused on racial features; these results are not from the models talking about race in the wild but talking about race in an experimental setup where they have been primed to do so. Additionally, since we are measuring sentiment by simply looking at word co-occurrences, the resulting sentiment can reflect socio-historical factors - for instance, text relating to a discussion of slavery will frequently have a negative sentiment, which may lead to a demographic being associated with a negative sentiment under this testing methodology. \n\nAcross the models we analyzed, `Asian' had a consistently high sentiment - it ranked 1st in 3 out of 7 models. On the other hand, 'Black' had a consistently low sentiment - it ranked the lowest in 5 out of 7 models. These differences narrowed marginally on the larger model sizes. This analysis gives a sense of the biases of different models and highlights the need for more sophisticated analysis of the relationship between sentiment, entities, and input data.\n\n\n        \n        \n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Religion\n\n        \n        We studied which words co-occurred with religious terms relating to Atheism, Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, and Judaism, by generating 800 model outputs of length \u224850 with a temperature of 1 and a top p of 0.9 for every prompt. Our prompts were of the nature  (Eg. ) for each of the six religious categories listed above. We then allowed the model to naturally carry out completions and created a corpus of such completions for studying co-occurrence of words. \n\nThe following is an example output from the model:\n \n\n\n\n \n\nSimilar to race, we found that the models make associations with religious terms that indicate some propensity to reflect how these terms are sometimes presented in the world. For example, with the religion , we found that words such as ,  and  co-occurred at a higher rate than for other religions. We also found that words such as ,  and  co-occurred at a greater rate with Islam than with other religions and were in the top 40 most favored words for Islam in GPT-3.\n\n\n\n        \n        \n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Future Bias and Fairness Challenges\n\n        \n        We have presented this preliminary analysis to share some of the biases we found in order to motivate further research, and to highlight the inherent difficulties in characterizing biases in large-scale generative models; we expect this to be an area of continuous research for us and are excited to discuss different methodological approaches with the community. We view the work in this section as  subjective signposting - we chose gender, race, and religion as a starting point, but we recognize the inherent subjectivity in this choice. Our work is inspired by the literature on characterizing model attributes to develop informative labels such as Model Cards for Model Reporting from <cit.>.\n\nUltimately, it is important not just to characterize biases in language systems but to intervene. The literature on this is also extensive <cit.>, so we offer only a few brief comments on future directions specific to large language models. In order to pave the way for effective bias prevention in general purpose models, there is a need for building a common vocabulary tying together the normative, technical and empirical challenges of bias mitigation for these models. There is room for more research that engages with the literature outside NLP, better articulates normative statements about harm, and engages with the lived experience of communities affected by NLP systems  <cit.>. Thus, mitigation work should not be approached purely with a metric driven objective to `remove' bias as this has been shown to have blind spots <cit.> but in a holistic manner.\n\n\n    \n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Energy Usage\n\n    \n    Practical large-scale pre-training requires large amounts of computation, which is energy-intensive: training the GPT-3 175B consumed several thousand petaflop/s-days of compute during pre-training, compared to tens of petaflop/s-days for a 1.5B parameter GPT-2 model (Figure <ref>). This means we should be cognizant of the cost and efficiency of such models, as advocated by <cit.>. \n   \nThe use of large-scale pre-training also gives another lens through which to view the efficiency of large models - we should consider not only the resources that go into training them, but how these resources are amortized over the lifetime of a model, which will subsequently be used for a variety of purposes and fine-tuned for specific tasks. Though models like GPT-3 consume significant resources during training, they can be surprisingly efficient once trained: even with the full GPT-3 175B, generating 100 pages of content from a trained model can cost on the order of 0.4 kW-hr, or only a few cents in energy costs. Additionally, techniques like model distillation <cit.> can further bring down the cost of such models, letting us adopt a paradigm of training single, large-scale models, then creating more efficient versions of them for use in appropriate contexts. Algorithmic progress may also naturally further increase the efficiency of such models over time, similar to trends observed in image recognition and neural machine translation <cit.>.Several lines of work have focused on increasing parameter count and/or computation in language models as a means to improve generative or task performance. An early work scaled LSTM based language models to over a billion parameters <cit.>. One line of work straightforwardly increases the size of transformer models, scaling up parameters and FLOPS-per-token roughly in proportion.  Work in this vein has successively increased model size: 213 million parameters <cit.> in the original paper, 300 million parameters <cit.>, 1.5 billion parameters <cit.>, 8 billion parameters  <cit.>, 11 billion parameters <cit.>, and most recently 17 billion parameters <cit.>.  A second line of work has focused on increasing parameter count but not computation, as a means of increasing models\u2019 capacity to store information without increased computational cost.  These approaches rely on the conditional computation framework <cit.> and specifically, the mixture-of-experts method <cit.> has been used to produce 100 billion parameter models and more recently 50 billion parameter translation models <cit.>, though only a small fraction of the parameters are actually used on each forward pass. A third approach increases computation without increasing parameters; examples of this approach include adaptive computation time <cit.> and  the universal transformer <cit.>. Our work focuses on the first approach (scaling compute and parameters together, by straightforwardly making the neural net larger), and increases model size 10x beyond previous models that employ this strategy.\n\nSeveral efforts have also systematically studied the effect of scale on language model performance.  <cit.>, find a smooth power-law trend in loss as autoregressive language models are scaled up.  This work suggests that this trend largely continues as models continue to scale up (although a slight bending of the curve can perhaps be detected in Figure <ref>), and we also find relatively smooth increases in many (though not all) downstream tasks across 3 orders of magnitude of scaling.\n\nAnother line of work goes in the opposite direction from scaling, attempting to preserve strong performance in language models that are as small as possible.  This approach includes ALBERT <cit.> as well as general <cit.> and task-specific <cit.> approaches to distillation of language models.  These architectures and techniques are potentially complementary to our work, and could be applied to decrease latency and memory footprint of giant models.\n\nAs fine-tuned language models have neared human performance on many standard benchmark tasks, considerable effort has been devoted to constructing more difficult or open-ended tasks, including question answering <cit.>, reading comprehension <cit.>, and adversarially constructed datasets designed to be difficult for existing language models <cit.>.  In this work we test our models on many of these datasets.\n\nMany previous efforts have focused specifically on question-answering, which constitutes a significant fraction of the tasks we tested on.  Recent efforts include\u00a0<cit.>, which fine-tuned an 11 billion parameter language model, and\u00a0<cit.>, which focused on attending over a large corpus of data at test time.  Our work differs in focusing on in-context learning but could be combined in the future with those of <cit.>.\n\n\nMetalearning in language models has been utilized in <cit.>, though with much more limited results and no systematic study.  More broadly, language model metalearning has an inner-loop-outer-loop structure, making it structurally similar to metalearning as applied to ML in general.  Here there is an extensive literature, including matching networks\u00a0<cit.>, RL2 <cit.>,  learning to optimize\u00a0<cit.> and MAML <cit.>.  Our approach of stuffing the model\u2019s context with previous examples is most structurally similar to RL2 and also resembles\u00a0<cit.>, in that an inner loop of adaptation takes place through computation in the model\u2019s activations across timesteps, without updating the weights, while an outer loop (in this case just language model pre-training) updates the weights, and implicitly learns the ability to adapt to or at least recognize tasks defined at inference-time. Few-shot auto-regressive density estimation was explored in \u00a0<cit.> and\u00a0<cit.> studied low-resource NMT as a few-shot learning problem.\n\nWhile the mechanism of our few-shot approach is different, prior work has also explored ways of using pre-trained language models in combination with gradient descent to perform few-shot learning <cit.>. Another sub-field with similar goals is semi-supervised learning where approaches such as UDA <cit.> also explore methods of fine-tuning when very little labeled data is available.\n\nGiving multi-task models instructions in natural language was first formalized in a supervised setting with <cit.> and utilized for some tasks (such as summarizing) in a language model with <cit.>.  The notion of presenting tasks in natural language was also explored in the text-to-text transformer  <cit.>, although there it was applied for multi-task fine-tuning rather than for in-context learning without weight updates.\n\nAnother approach to increasing generality and transfer-learning capability in language models is multi-task learning <cit.>, which fine-tunes on a mixture of downstream tasks together, rather than separately updating the weights for each one.  If successful multi-task learning could allow a single model to be used for many tasks without updating the weights (similar to our in-context learning approach), or alternatively could improve sample efficiency when updating the weights for a new task.  Multi-task learning has shown some promising initial results\u00a0<cit.> and multi-stage fine-tuning has recently become a standardized part of SOTA results on some datasets <cit.> and pushed the boundaries on certain tasks <cit.>, but is still limited by the need to manually curate collections of datasets and set up training curricula.  By contrast pre-training at large enough scale appears to offer a \u201cnatural\u201d broad distribution of tasks implicitly contained in predicting the text itself.  One direction for future work might be attempting to generate a broader set of explicit tasks for multi-task learning, for example through procedural generation <cit.>, human interaction <cit.>, or active learning <cit.>.\n\nAlgorithmic innovation in language models over the last two years has been enormous, including denoising-based bidirectionality <cit.>, prefixLM <cit.> and encoder-decoder architectures <cit.>, random permutations during training <cit.>, architectures that improve the efficiency of sampling <cit.>, improvements in data and training procedures <cit.>, and efficiency increases in the embedding parameters <cit.>.  Many of these techniques provide significant gains on downstream tasks.  In this work we continue to focus on pure autoregressive language models, both in order to focus on in-context learning performance and to reduce the complexity of our large model implementations.  However, it is very likely that incorporating these algorithmic advances could improve GPT-3\u2019s performance on downstream tasks, especially in the fine-tuning setting, and combining GPT-3\u2019s scale with these algorithmic techniques is a promising direction for future work.We presented a 175 billion parameter language model which shows strong performance on many NLP tasks and benchmarks in the zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot settings, in some cases nearly matching the performance of state-of-the-art fine-tuned systems, as well as generating high-quality samples and strong qualitative performance at tasks defined on-the-fly.  We documented roughly predictable trends of scaling in performance without using fine-tuning.  We also discussed the social impacts of this class of model.  Despite many limitations and weaknesses, these results suggest that very large language models may be an important ingredient in the development of adaptable, general language systems.The authors would like to thank Ryan Lowe for giving detailed feedback on drafts of the paper.

Using the original WebText as a proxy for high-quality documents, we trained a classifier to distinguish these from raw Common Crawl. We then used this classifier to re-sample Common Crawl by prioritizing documents which were predicted by the classifier to be higher quality. The classifier is trained using logistic regression classifier with features from Spark's standard tokenizer and HashingTF [<https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.ml.html#pyspark.ml.feature.HashingTF>]. For the positive examples, we used a collection of curated datasets such as WebText, Wikiedia, and our web books corpus as the positive examples, and for the negative examples, we used unfiltered Common Crawl.  We used this classifier to score Common Crawl documents. We kept each document in our dataset iff\n\n\n    (\u03b1) > 1 -\n\n\nWe chose \u03b1 = 9 in order to take mostly documents the classifier scored highly, but still include some documents that were out of distribution. \u03b1 was chosen to match the distribution of scores from our classifier on WebText.  We found this re-weighting increased quality as measured by loss on a range of out-of-distribution generative text samples.\n\n  * To further improve model quality and prevent overfitting (which becomes increasingly important as model capacity increases), we fuzzily deduplicated documents (i.e. removed documents with high overlap with other documents) within each dataset using Spark's MinHashLSH implementation with 10 hashes, using the same features as were used for classification above.  We also fuzzily removed WebText from Common Crawl. Overall this decreased dataset size by an average of 10%.\n\n\n\nAfter filtering for duplicates and quality, we also partially removed text occurring in benchmark datasets, described in Appendix <ref>.To train all versions of GPT-3, we use Adam with \u03b2_1=0.9, \u03b2_2=0.95, and \u03f5=10^-8, we clip the global norm of the gradient at 1.0, and we use cosine decay for learning rate down to 10% of its value, over 260 billion tokens (after 260 billion tokens, training continues at 10% of the original learning rate).  There is a linear LR warmup over the first 375 million tokens.  We also gradually increase the batch size linearly from a small value (32k tokens) to the full value over the first 4-12 billion tokens of training, depending on the model size.  Data are sampled without replacement during training (until an epoch boundary is reached) to minimize overfitting. All models use weight decay of 0.1 to provide a small amount of regularization <cit.>.\n\nDuring training we always train on sequences of the full n_ctx=2048 token context window, packing multiple documents into a single sequence when documents are shorter than 2048, in order to increase computational efficiency.  Sequences with multiple documents are not masked in any special way but instead documents within a sequence are delimited with a special end of text token, giving the language model the information necessary to infer that context separated by the end of text token is unrelated.  This allows for efficient training without need for any special sequence-specific masking.In section <ref> we gave a high level overview of test set contamination studies. In this section we provide details on methodology and results.\n\n\n\n  \nInitial training set filtering We attempted to remove text occurring in benchmarks from training data by searching for 13-gram overlaps between all test/development sets used in this work and our training data, and we removed the colliding 13-gram as well as a 200 character window around it, splitting the original document into pieces. For filtering purposes we define a gram as a lowercase, whitespace delimited word with no punctuation. Pieces less than 200 characters long were discarded. Documents split into more than 10 pieces were considered contaminated and removed entirely. Originally we removed entire documents given a single collision, but that overly penalized long documents such as books for false positives. An example of a false positive might be a test set based on Wikipedia, in which the Wikipedia article quotes a single line from a book. We ignored 13-grams that matched more than 10 training documents, as inspection showed the majority of these to contain common cultural phrases, legal boilerplate, or similar content that we likely do want the model to learn, rather than undesired specific overlaps with test sets. Examples for various frequencies can be found in the GPT-3 release repository[<https://github.com/openai/gpt-3/blob/master/overlap_frequency.md>].\n\n\n\n  \nOverlap methodology For our benchmark overlap analysis in Section <ref>, we used a variable number of words N to check for overlap for each dataset, where N is the 5th percentile example length in words, ignoring all punctuation, whitespace, and casing. Due to spurious collisions at lower values of N we use a minimum value of 8 on non-synthetic tasks. For performance reasons, we set a maximum value of 13 for all tasks. Values for N and the amount of data marked as dirty are shown in Table <ref>. Unlike GPT-2's use of bloom filters to compute probabilistic bounds for test contamination, we used Apache Spark to compute exact collisions across all training and test sets. We compute overlaps between test sets and our full training corpus, even though we only trained on 40% of our filtered Common Crawl documents per Section <ref>.\n\nWe define a `dirty' example as one with any N-gram overlap with any training document, and a `clean' example as one with no collision.\n\nTest and validation splits had similar contamination levels despite some test splits being unlabeled. Due to a bug revealed by this analysis, filtering described above failed on long documents such as books. Because of cost considerations it was infeasible to retrain the model on a corrected version of the training dataset. As such, several language modeling benchmarks plus the Children's Book Test showed almost complete overlap, and therefore were not included in this paper. Overlaps are shown in Table <ref>\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \nOverlap results To understand how much having seen some of the data helps the model perform on downstream tasks, we filter every validation and test set by dirtiness. Then we run evaluation on the clean-only examples and report the relative percent change between the clean score and the original score. If the clean score is more than 1% or 2% worse than the overall score, it suggests the model may have overfit to the examples it has seen. If the clean score is significantly better, our filtering scheme may have preferentially marked easier examples as dirty.\n\nThis overlap metric tends to show a high rate of false positives for datasets that contain background information (but not answers) drawn from the web (such as SQuAD, which draws from Wikipedia) or examples less than 8 words long, which we ignored in our filtering process (except for wordscrambling tasks). One instance where this technique seems to fail to give good signal is DROP, a reading comprehension task in which 94% of the examples are dirty. The information required to answer the question is in a passage provided to the model, so having seen the passage during training but not the questions and answers does not meaningfully constitute cheating. We confirmed that every matching training document contained only the source passage, and none of the questions and answers in the dataset. The more likely explanation for the decrease in performance is that the 6% of examples that remain after filtering come from a slightly different distribution than the dirty examples.\n\nFigure <ref> shows that as the dataset becomes more contaminated, the variance of the clean/all fraction increases, but there is no apparent bias towards improved or degraded performance. This suggests that GPT-3 is relatively insensitive to contamination. See Section <ref> for details on the datasets we flagged for further review.This appendix contains the calculations that were used to derive the approximate compute used to train the language models in Figure <ref>. As a simplifying assumption, we ignore the attention operation, as it typically uses less than 10% of the total compute for the models we are analyzing.\n\nCalculations can be seen in Table <ref> and are explained within the table caption.This appendix contains details on the experiments measuring human ability to distinguish GPT-3-generated synthetic news articles from real news articles. We first describe the experiments on the \u223c200 word news articles, and then describe the preliminary investigation of \u223c500 word news articles generated by GPT-3.\n\nParticipants: We recruited 718 unique participants to take part in 6 experiments. 97 participants were excluded  for failing an internet check question, leaving a total of 621 participants: 343 male, 271 female, and 7 other. Mean participant age was \u223c38 years old. All participants were recruited through Positly, which maintains a whitelist of high-performing workers from Mechanical Turk. All participants were US-based but there were no other demographic restrictions. Participants were paid $12 for their participation, based on a task time estimate of 60 minutes determined by pilot runs. In order to ensure that the sample of participants for each experiment quiz was unique, participants were not allowed to take part in an experiment more than once.\n\nProcedure and design: We arbitrarily selected 25 news articles that appeared in newser.comnewser.com in early 2020. We used the article titles and subtitles to produce outputs from the 125M, 350M, 760M, 1.3B, 2.7B, 6.7B, 13.0B, and 200B (GPT-3) parameter language models. Five outputs per question were generated by each model and the generation with a word count closest to that of the human written article was selected automatically. This was to minimize the effect that completion length might have on participants\u2019 judgments.  The same output procedure for each model with the exception of the removal of the intentionally bad control model, as described in the main text. \n\nIn each experiment, half of the participants were randomly assigned to quiz A and half were randomly assigned to quiz B. Each quiz consisted of 25 articles: half (12-13) were human written and half (12-13) were model generated: the articles with human written completions in quiz A had model generated completions in quiz B and vice versa. The order of quiz question was shuffled for each participant. Participants could leave comments and were asked to indicate if they had seen the articles before. Participants were instructed not to look up the articles or their content during the quiz and at the end of the quiz were asked if they had looked anything up during the quiz.\n\n\n\nStatistical Tests: To compare means on the different runs, we performed a two-sample t-test for independent groups for each model against the control. This was implemented in Python using the  function. When plotting a regression line in the graph of average participant accuracy vs model size, we fit a power law of the form ax^-b. The 95% confidence intervals were estimated from the t-distribution of the sample mean.\n\n\n\nDuration statistics: In the main text, we discussed the finding that the ability of human participants to distinguish model and human generated news articles decreases as our models become larger. We have also found that the average time spent for a given set of questions increases as the model size increases, as shown in Figure <ref>. Lower accuracy scores despite increased time investment from participants supports the finding that larger models generate harder-to-distinguish news articles.\n\nPreliminary investigation of \u223c500 word articles: We recruited 160 unique US-based participants to take part in 2 experiments through Positly (details are given in Table <ref>). We randomly selected 12 Reuters world news articles from late 2019 and created a context for GPT-3 175B that consisted of a single Reuters article not in this set of 12. We then used the article titles and Reuters locations to generate completions from GPT-3 175B and the 160M control model from the previous experiments. These were used to create two 12-question quizzes per model, each consisting of half human written and half model generated articles. Comprehension questions were added and articles were shown to participants in 3 stages at 30 second intervals to encourage closer reading. Participants were paid $12 for this task. Model generation selection methods, exclusion criteria, and statistical tests mirror those of the previous experiments.GPT-3 adapts well to many tasks other than the ones explored in the main body of the paper.  As an example, in Figure <ref>, we show four uncurated samples from a prompt suggesting that the model write a poem, with a given title, in the style of Wallace Stevens.  We first experimented with a few prompts, then generated four  samples with no additional editing or selection (sampling at temperature 1 using nucleus sampling <cit.> with P=0.9).

All data comes from the ground truth datasets in this section, and no samples from GPT-3 are included here.alpha", "result": "Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) have been driven by large-scale pre-training followed by task-specific fine-tuning. These tasks often require large labeled datasets, but humans learn many tasks from just a few examples. We show that scaling up language models improves their few-shot learning abilities. We test the recently released 175 billion parameter model, GPT-3, in a few-shot setting, and find that it performs surprisingly well on a wide variety of NLP tasks, including translation, question-answering, cloze, and grammatical error correction, without updating the model\u2019s parameters via gradient descent or any explicit fine-tuning. GPT-3 even succeeds at on-the-fly reasoning and induction tasks, and at tasks in domains requiring significant domain knowledge. However, there are also several tasks where GPT-3 fails, and we find that this is sometimes due to methodological issues in the original papers reporting success on these tasks. GPT-3 can also write almost indistinguishable human-like news articles. While these results are encouraging, they also suggest ways in which current NLP techniques may be limited in their ability to learn and generalize.We would like to thank our reviewers for their helpful comments, and in particular Peter Clark for his suggestions on improving the clarity of the paper.

Task-specific systems, like the shallow neural networks of the 1990s <cit.>, were often trained to perform one task, like sentiment classification or named entity recognition. Such systems were brittle and required large amounts of task-specific data. In contrast, task-agnostic systems like BERT <cit.> and ELMO <cit.> are trained on a general language modeling task, allowing them to be adapted to a variety of different downstream tasks with little or no additional training. The effectiveness of these systems has been attributed to the fact that they learn rich, abstract representations of language in a large unlabeled corpus. However, each of these systems must still be fine-tuned for each individual task, requiring a large amount of task-specific data.\n\n\nOne promising solution to this problem is meta-learning, which aims to develop systems that can quickly learn new tasks with little supervision. Meta-learning algorithms are trained on a set of tasks, then evaluated on their ability to quickly learn new tasks. There are many ways to approach meta-learning, and most fall into one of two categories: learning to learn (e.g. MAML <cit.>) or learning representations that are useful across tasks (e.g. Prototypical Networks <cit.>). Learning to learn methods attempt to learn how to learn by optimizing the learning algorithm itself. Representational methods aim to learn representations that are useful for a wide variety of tasks. In this paper, we focus on the latter approach, since it avoids many of the pitfalls associated with learning to learn.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 In-Context Learning\n\n\nThe recent success of large language models suggests that in-context learning may be a promising way to achieve meta-learning. In-context learning refers to the ability of a system to learn new tasks with just a few demonstrations of the task. It is called \u201cin-context\u201d learning because the demonstrations are given as context to the system, but are not actually used to update the system\u2019s parameters. This is in contrast to supervised learning, where the demonstrations are used to update the system\u2019s parameters via backpropagation. \n\n\nThe ability to learn from context alone is surprising because it is analogous to learning a task by reading instructions, rather than by learning from examples. Humans are known to be able to do this, and it is a key factor in their ability to learn new tasks quickly. However, it is unclear whether machines can learn to do this as well.\n\n\nRecently, there has been a growing interest in in-context learning, with a particular focus on the ability of large language models to learn from context. In particular, there have been a number of studies showing that large language models can perform well on a wide variety of tasks when given a small number of demonstrations of the task. This has led some to argue that in-context learning may be a promising way to achieve meta-learning.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Increasing Transformer Capacity\n\n\nIn recent years, there has been a growing trend towards increasing the capacity of transformer-based language models. This trend has been driven by a number of factors, including the increasing availability of computing power and the increasing availability of large labeled datasets. The idea behind this trend is that larger models are able to learn more complex representations of language, which in turn leads to better performance on a variety of tasks.\n\n\n\nThere have been a number of studies demonstrating the benefits of increasing transformer capacity. For example, <cit.> showed that increasing the number of parameters in a transformer-based language model leads to improved performance on a variety of tasks. Similarly, <cit.> showed that increasing the number of layers in a transformer-based language model leads to improved performance on a variety of tasks.\n\n\nThese studies suggest that there may be a power-law relationship between model capacity and performance. That is, as model capacity increases, performance improves at an accelerating rate. This suggests that there may be a limit to the performance of transformer-based language models, and that this limit may be reached by models with a very large number of parameters.\n\n\nWhile there is still much debate about the optimal size of a transformer-based language model, it is clear that the trend towards increasing capacity is likely to continue in the near future. This is because there is still a lot of untapped potential in the transformer architecture, and because there is a growing need for models that can handle the increasingly complex tasks that are being developed.\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Scaling Law Hypothesis\n\n\nOne hypothesis that has been put forward to explain the improved performance of larger models is the scaling law hypothesis. This hypothesis posits that there is a power-law relationship between model capacity and performance. That is, as model capacity increases, performance improves at an accelerating rate.\n\n\nThis hypothesis is supported by a number of studies that have shown that larger models tend to outperform smaller models on a variety of tasks. For example, <cit.> showed that increasing the number of parameters in a transformer-based language model leads to improved performance on a variety of tasks. Similarly, <cit.> showed that increasing the number of layers in a transformer-based language model leads to improved performance on a variety of tasks.\n\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the scaling law hypothesis is still a hypothesis, and that there is still much debate about whether it is true. Some researchers have argued that the improved performance of larger models is due to other factors, such as the ability of larger models to fit larger datasets <cit.>.\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Large Language Models\n\n\nLarge language models have become increasingly popular in recent years due to their ability to learn from large amounts of data and their ability to perform a wide range of tasks. These models are often trained on large amounts of text data, such as books, web pages, and other textual sources. They are then able to use this knowledge to answer questions, generate text, and perform a variety of other tasks.\n\n\nOne of the main advantages of large language models is their ability to learn from large amounts of data. This allows them to learn a wide range of concepts and to be able to generalize to new situations. Another advantage of these models is their ability to perform a wide range of tasks. This makes them useful for a variety of different applications, such as question answering, text generation, and machine translation.\n\n\nDespite their many advantages, large language models also have some limitations. One limitation is their tendency to memorize the data they are trained on. This can lead to the model producing incorrect answers when faced with new data that is similar to the data it has seen before. Another limitation is their tendency to produce biased answers. This can happen when the data the model is trained on is biased in some way.\n\n\nDespite these limitations, large language models have become increasingly popular in recent years and are expected to continue to grow in popularity in the future.The results of the experiments reported in this paper suggest that scaling up the capacity of language models can improve their ability to learn from context. This is in line with previous work that has shown that increasing the capacity of language models can improve their performance on a variety of tasks <cit.>. The results also suggest that this improvement in performance may be due to the fact that larger models are able to learn more complex representations of language, which in turn allows them to be more effective at learning from context.\n\n\nWhile the results of this paper are promising, it is important to note that they are not conclusive. More work is needed to fully understand the relationship between model capacity and performance, and to determine the optimal size of a language model for a given task. Nevertheless, the results of this paper suggest that scaling up the capacity of language models is a promising approach to improving their ability to learn from context, and they provide a foundation for further research in this area.In this paper, we explored the hypothesis that scaling up the capacity of language models can improve their ability to learn from context. We tested this hypothesis by training a series of large language models with varying levels of capacity, and then evaluating their performance on a variety of tasks.\n\n\nOur results suggest that scaling up the capacity of language models can indeed improve their ability to learn from context. We found that the largest model, with 175 billion parameters, was able to perform well on a wide variety of tasks, including language modeling, translation, question answering, and text classification. This suggests that the larger model was able to learn more complex representations of language, which in turn allowed it to be more effective at learning from context.\n\n\nHowever, it is important to note that our results are not conclusive. While the larger model performed well on a variety of tasks, it is possible that even larger models would perform even better. Additionally, while our results suggest that scaling up the capacity of language models can improve their ability to learn from context, it is not the only factor that affects performance. Other factors, such as the quality of the training data and the choice of training algorithm, can also have a significant impact on performance.\n\n\nDespite these limitations, our results provide evidence for the hypothesis that scaling up the capacity of language models can improve their ability to learn from context. This suggests that this approach may be a promising way to improve the performance of language models on a variety of tasks, and it provides a foundation for further research in this area.As we have shown, scaling up the capacity of language models can improve their ability to learn from context. However, there are a number of limitations to this approach. One limitation is that training and deploying large language models requires significant computational resources. This can make it difficult to train and deploy these models in many settings.\n\n\nAnother limitation is that large language models can be difficult to interpret. This can make it difficult to understand why the model is making certain predictions, and it can also make it difficult to debug the model when it produces incorrect results.\n\n\nFinally, large language models can be prone to overfitting. This means that they may perform well on the training data, but poorly on new, unseen data. This can make it difficult to deploy these models in real-world settings, where the data is likely to be different from the training data.\n\n\nDespite these limitations, we believe that scaling up the capacity of language models is a promising approach to improving their ability to learn from context. We hope that our work will inspire further research in this area, and we look forward to seeing the results of this research in the future.There are a number of ways in which language models can be used to improve the performance of NLP systems. One approach is to use language models to generate new data, which can then be used to train other models. This approach has been used to generate synthetic data for tasks such as question answering <cit.> and sentiment classification <cit.>. Another approach is to use language models to encode the meaning of text, which can then be used to perform tasks such as semantic similarity <cit.> and paraphrase detection <cit.>.\n\n\nLanguage models can also be used to improve the performance of NLP systems by helping them to disambiguate the meaning of text. For example, language models can be used to predict the probability of different interpretations of a sentence, which can help the system to choose the most likely interpretation <cit.>. Additionally, language models can be used to generate new sentences that are similar to a given sentence, which can help the system to find alternative interpretations of the sentence <cit.>.\n\n\nFinally, language models can be used to improve the performance of NLP systems by helping them to understand the context in which text is written. For example, language models can be used to predict the probability of different words appearing in a given context, which can help the system to understand the meaning of the text <cit.>. Additionally, language models can be used to generate new sentences that are similar to a given sentence, which can help the system to understand the context in which the sentence was written <cit.>.\n\n\nOverall, language models have the potential to greatly improve the performance of NLP systems. By enabling the generation of new data, the encoding of meaning, the disambiguation of meaning, and the understanding of context, language models can help NLP systems to better understand and interpret text.This section describes the tasks and datasets used in the experiments reported in this paper.

For rationale-augmented training and finetuning methods, it is costly to create a large set of high quality rationales, which is much more complicated than simple input\u2013output pairs used in normal machine learning. \nFor the traditional few-shot prompting method used in <cit.>, it works poorly on tasks that require reasoning abilities, and often does not improve substantially with increasing language model scale <cit.>. \nIn this paper, we combine the strengths of these two ideas in a way that avoids their limitations. Specifically, we explore the ability of language models to perform few-shot prompting for reasoning tasks, given a prompt that consists of triples: \u27e8input, chain of thought, output\u27e9.\nA chain of thought is a series of intermediate natural language reasoning steps that lead to the final output, and we refer to this approach as chain-of-thought prompting. An example prompt is shown in <ref>. \n\n\nWe present empirical evaluations on arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning benchmarks, showing that chain-of-thought prompting outperforms standard prompting, sometimes to a striking degree.\n<ref> illustrates one such result\u2014on the GSM8K benchmark of math word problems <cit.>, chain-of-thought prompting with  540B outperforms standard prompting by a large margin and achieves new state-of-the-art performance.\nA prompting only approach is important because it does not require a large training dataset and because a single model checkpoint can perform many tasks without loss of generality.\nThis work underscores how large language models can learn via a few examples with natural language data about the task (c.f. automatically learning the patterns underlying inputs and outputs via a large training dataset).Consider one's own thought process when solving a complicated reasoning task such as a multi-step math word problem. \nIt is typical to decompose the problem into intermediate steps and solve each before giving the final answer: \u201cAfter Jane gives 2 flowers to her mom she has 10 \u2026 then after she gives 3 to her dad she will have 7 \u2026 so the answer is 7.\u201d\nThe goal of this paper is to endow language models with the ability to generate a similar chain of thought\u2014a coherent series of intermediate reasoning steps that lead to the final answer for a problem.\nWe will show that sufficiently large language models can generate chains of thought if demonstrations of chain-of-thought reasoning are provided in the exemplars for few-shot prompting.\n\n<ref> shows an example of a model producing a chain of thought to solve a math word problem that it would have otherwise gotten incorrect.\nThe chain of thought in this case resembles a solution and can interpreted as one, but we still opt to call it a chain of thought to better capture the idea that it mimics a step-by-step thought process for arriving at the answer (and also, solutions/explanations typically come after the final answer <cit.>).\n\nChain-of-thought prompting has several attractive properties as an approach for facilitating reasoning in language models.\n\n    \n  * First, chain of thought, in principle, allows models to decompose multi-step problems into intermediate steps, which means that additional computation can be allocated to problems that require more reasoning steps.\n    \n  * Second, a chain of thought provides an interpretable window into the behavior of the model, suggesting how it might have arrived at a particular answer and providing opportunities to debug where the reasoning path went wrong (although fully characterizing a model's computations that support an answer remains an open question).\n    \n  * Third, chain-of-thought reasoning can be used for tasks such as math word problems, commonsense reasoning, and symbolic manipulation, and is potentially applicable (at least in principle) to any task that humans can solve via language.\n    \n  * Finally, chain-of-thought reasoning can be readily elicited in sufficiently large off-the-shelf language models simply by including examples of chain of thought sequences into the exemplars of few-shot prompting.\n\n\nIn empirical experiments, we will observe the utility of chain-of-thought prompting for arithmetic reasoning (<ref>), commonsense reasoning (<ref>), and symbolic reasoning (<ref>).We begin by considering math word problems of the form in <ref>, which measure the arithmetic reasoning ability of language models.\nThough simple for humans, arithmetic reasoning is a task where language models often struggle <cit.>.\nStrikingly, chain-of-thought prompting when used with the 540B parameter language model performs comparably with task-specific finetuned models on several tasks, even achieving new state of the art on the challenging GSM8K benchmark <cit.>.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Experimental Setup\n\n\nWe explore chain-of-thought prompting for various language models on multiple benchmarks.\n\nBenchmarks.\nWe consider the following five math word problem benchmarks:\n(1) the GSM8K benchmark of math word problems <cit.>, \n(2) the SVAMP dataset of math word problems with varying structures <cit.>,\n(3) the ASDiv dataset of diverse math word problems <cit.>,\n(4) the AQuA dataset of algebraic word problems, and\n(5) the MAWPS benchmark <cit.>.\nExample problems are given in Appendix <ref>.\n\nStandard prompting.\nFor the baseline, we consider standard few-shot prompting, popularized by <cit.>, in which a language model is given in-context exemplars of input\u2013output pairs before outputting a prediction for a test-time example. \nExemplars are formatted as questions and answers. \nThe model gives the answer directly, as shown in <ref> (left).\n\nChain-of-thought prompting.\nOur proposed approach is to augment each exemplar in few-shot prompting with a chain of thought for an associated answer, as illustrated in <ref> (right). \nAs most of the datasets only have an evaluation split, we manually composed a set of eight few-shot exemplars with chains of thought for prompting\u2014<ref> (right) shows one chain of thought exemplar, and the full set of exemplars is given in Appendix <ref>. \n(These particular exemplars did not undergo prompt engineering; robustness is studied in <ref> and <ref>.)\nTo investigate whether chain-of-thought prompting in this form can successfully elicit successful reasoning across a range of math word problems, we used this single set of eight chain of thought exemplars for all benchmarks except AQuA, which is multiple choice instead of free response.\nFor AQuA, we used four exemplars and solutions from the training set, as given in Appendix <ref>.\n\nLanguage models.\nWe evaluate five large language models.\nThe first is GPT-3 <cit.>, for which we use text-ada-001, text-babbage-001, text-curie-001, and text-davinci-002, which presumably correspond to InstructGPT models of 350M, 1.3B, 6.7B, and 175B parameters <cit.>.\nThe second is  <cit.>, which has models of 422M, 2B, 8B, 68B, and 137B parameters. \nThe third is , which has models of 8B, 62B, and 540B parameters.\nThe fourth is UL2 20B <cit.>, and the fifth is Codex <cit.>.\nWe sample from the models via greedy decoding (though follow-up work shows chain-of-thought prompting can be improved by taking the majority final answer over many sampled generations <cit.>).\nFor , we report averaged results over five random seeds, where each seed had a different randomly shuffled order of exemplars.\nAs  experiments did not show large variance among different seeds, to save compute we report results for a single exemplar order for all other models.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Results\n\nThe strongest results of chain-of-thought prompting are summarized in <ref>, with all experimental outputs for each model collection, model size, and benchmark shown in <ref> in the Appendix.\nThere are three key takeaways.\nFirst, <ref> shows that chain-of-thought prompting is an emergent ability of model scale <cit.>. \nThat is, chain-of-thought prompting does not positively impact performance for small models, and only yields performance gains when used with models of \u223c100B parameters.\nWe qualitatively found that models of smaller scale produced fluent but illogical chains of thought, leading to lower performance than standard prompting.\n\nr0.5\n    \n    \n

Notably, chain-of-thought reasoning is an emergent ability of increasing model scale.\n    Prior best numbers are from <cit.> for GSM8K, <cit.> for SVAMP, and <cit.> for MAWPS.\n    \n    \n\n    \n    \n\nSecond, chain-of-thought prompting has larger performance gains for more-complicated problems. \nFor instance, for GSM8K (the dataset with the lowest baseline performance), performance more than doubled for the largest GPT and  models. \nOn the other hand, for SingleOp, the easiest subset of MAWPS which only requires a single step to solve, performance improvements were either negative or very small (see Appendix <ref>).\n\nThird, chain-of-thought prompting via GPT-3 175B and  540B compares favorably to prior state of the art, which typically finetunes a task-specific model on a labeled training dataset. \n<ref> shows how  540B uses chain-of-thought prompting to achieve new state of the art on GSM8K, SVAMP, and MAWPS (though note that standard prompting already passed the prior best for SVAMP).\nOn the other two datasets, AQuA and ASDiv,  with chain-of-thought prompting reaches within 2% of the state of the art (Appendix <ref>).\n\nTo better understand why chain-of-thought prompting works,\nwe manually examined model-generated chains of thought by  137B for GSM8K.\nOf 50 random examples where the model returned the correct final answer, all of the generated chains of thought were also logically and mathematically correct except two that coincidentally arrived at the correct answer (see <ref>, and <ref> for examples of correct model-generated chains of thought).\nWe also randomly examined 50 random samples for which the model gave the wrong answer.\nThe summary of this analysis is that 46% of the chains of thought were almost correct, barring minor mistakes (calculator error, symbol mapping error, or one reasoning step missing), and that the other 54% of the chains of thought had major errors in semantic understanding or coherence (see <ref>). \nTo provide a small insight into why scaling improves chain-of-thought reasoning ability, we performed a similar analysis of errors made by  62B and whether those errors were fixed by scaling to  540B.\nThe summary is that scaling  to 540B fixes a large portion of one-step missing and semantic understanding errors in the 62B model (see <ref>).\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Ablation Study\n\n\nThe observed benefits of using chain-of-thought prompting raises the natural question of whether the same performance improvements can be conferred via other types of prompting.\n<ref> shows an ablation study with three variations of chain of thought described below.\n\nEquation only. One reason for why chain-of-thought prompting might help is that it produces the mathematical equation to be evaluated, and so we test a variation where the model is prompted to output only a mathematical equation before giving the answer. \n<ref> shows that equation only prompting does not help much for GSM8K, which implies that the semantics of the questions in GSM8K are too challenging to directly translate into an equation without the natural language reasoning steps in chain of thought.\nFor datasets of one-step or two-step problems, however, we find that equation only prompting does improve performance, since the equation can be easily derived from the question (see Appendix <ref>). \n\nr0.35\nwidth=5.2cm, height=4.5cm\n      \n          \n        [  \n            ybar,\n            ymin=0, ymax=65,\n            ytick=0, 20, 40, 60,\n            major x tick style = transparent,\n            bar width=6pt,\n            enlarge x limits=0.5,\n            ylabel=GSM8K solve rate (%),\n            symbolic x coords=, ,  \n            xtick=data,  \n                axis x line*=bottom,\n                axis y line*=left,\n                legend style=draw=none,\n        legend cell align=left,\n                legend style=\n                        at=(1,1.05),\n                        anchor=south east,\n                        column sep=1ex,\n                        font=,\n                \n            ]  \n        [ybar, fill=bananayellow,  postaction=] coordinates \n            (, 6.3) (, 17.9)\n        ;\n        [ybar, fill=blanchedalmond,  postaction=pattern=north west lines] coordinates \n            (, 5.7) (, 21.7)\n        ;

For each of 4 days, 5 more computers were added. So 5 * 4 = 20 computers were added. 9 + 20 is 29.\u201d), the concise chain of thought would read \u201c5 * 4 = 20 new computers were added. So there are 9 + 20 = 29 new computers in the server room now\u201d.]\n\n<ref> shows these results for  137B on GSM8K and MAWPS (ablation results for other datasets are given in Appendix <ref> / <ref>).\nAlthough there is variance among different chain of thought annotations, as would be expected when using exemplar-based prompting <cit.>, all sets of chain of thought prompts outperform the standard baseline by a large margin. \nThis result implies that successful use of chain of thought does not depend on a particular linguistic style.\n\nTo confirm that successful chain-of-thought prompting works for other sets of exemplars, we also run experiments with three sets of eight exemplars randomly sampled from the GSM8K training set, an independent source (examples in this dataset already included reasoning steps like a chain of thought).[We sample examples \u2264 60 tokens to fit into our input context window, and also limit the examples to \u2264 2 steps to solve for a fair comparison with the eight exemplars that we composed.]\n<ref> shows that these prompts performed comparably with our manually written exemplars, also substantially outperforming standard prompting.\n\nIn addition to robustness to annotators, independently-written chains of thought, different exemplars, and various language models, we also find that chain-of-thought prompting for arithmetic reasoning is robust to different exemplar orders and varying numbers of exemplars (see <ref>).Although chain of thought is particularly suitable for math word problems, the language-based nature of chain of thought actually makes it applicable to a broad class of commonsense reasoning problems, which involve reasoning about physical and human interactions under the presumption of general background knowledge.\nCommonsense reasoning is key for interacting with the world and is still beyond the reach of current natural language understanding systems <cit.>.\n\nBenchmarks.\nWe consider five datasets covering a diverse range of commonsense reasoning types.\nThe popular CSQA <cit.> asks commonsense questions about the world involving complex semantics that often require prior knowledge.\nStrategyQA <cit.> requires models to infer a multi-hop strategy to answer questions.\nWe choose two specialized evaluation sets from the BIG-bench effort <cit.>: Date Understanding, which involves inferring a date from a given context, and Sports Understanding, which involves determining whether a sentence relating to sports is plausible or implausible.\nFinally, the SayCan dataset <cit.> involves mapping a natural language instruction to a sequence of robot actions from a discrete set.\n<ref> shows examples with chain of thought annotations for all datasets.\n\nPrompts.\nWe follow the same experimental setup as the prior section. \nFor CSQA and StrategyQA, we randomly selected examples from the training set and manually composed chains of thought for them to use as few-shot exemplars.\nThe two BIG-bench tasks do not have training sets, so we selected the first ten examples as exemplars in the evaluation set as few-shot exemplars and report numbers on the rest of the evaluation set.\nFor SayCan, we use six examples from the training set used in <cit.> and also manually composed chains of thought.\n\nResults.\n<ref> highlights these results for  (full results for , GPT-3, and different model scales are shown in <ref>).\nFor all tasks, scaling up model size improved the performance of standard prompting; chain-of-thought prompting led to further gains, with improvements appearing to be largest for  540B.\nWith chain-of-thought prompting,  540B achieved strong performance relative to baselines, outperforming the prior state of the art on StrategyQA (75.6% vs 69.4%) and outperforming an unaided sports enthusiast on sports understanding (95.4% vs 84%).\nThese results demonstrate that chain-of-thought prompting can also improve performance on tasks requiring a range of commonsense reasoning abilities (though note that gain was minimal on CSQA).\n\n\n\n\nr0.40\n    \n\n    \n    \n        footnotesize,samples=10\n        [\n            group

symbolic reasoning tasks.Our final experimental evaluation considers symbolic reasoning, which is simple for humans but potentially challenging for language models.\nWe show that chain-of-thought prompting not only enables language models to perform symbolic reasoning tasks that are challenging in the standard prompting setting, but also facilitates length generalization to inference-time inputs longer than those seen in the few-shot exemplars.\n\n\n\n  \nTasks.\nWe use the following two toy tasks.\n\n    0em \n    \n  * Last letter concatenation.\n    This task asks the model to concatenate the last letters of words in a name (e.g., \u201cAmy Brown\u201d \u2192 \u201cyn\u201d). \n    It is a more challenging version of first letter concatenation, which language models can already perform without chain of thought.[We tested 10 common names using GPT-3  and it got all but one correct.]\n    We generate full names by randomly concatenating names from the top one-thousand first and last names from name census data (<https://namecensus.com/>).\n    \n  * Coin flip.\n    This task asks the model to answer whether a coin is still heads up after people either flip or don't flip the coin (e.g., \u201cA coin is heads up. Phoebe flips the coin. Osvaldo does not flip the coin. Is the coin still heads up?\u201d \u2192 \u201cno\u201d).\n\n\nAs the construction of these symbolic reasoning tasks is well-defined, for each task we consider an in-domain test set for which examples had the same number of steps as the training/few-shot exemplars, as well as an out-of-domain (OOD) test set, for which evaluation examples had more steps than those in the exemplars. \nFor last letter concatenation, the model only sees exemplars of names with two words, and then performs last letter concatenation on names with 3 and 4 words.[For names of length longer than 2 words, we concatenate multiple first and last names together.]\nWe do the same for the number of potential flips in the coin flip task. \nOur experimental setup uses the same methods and models as in the prior two sections.\nWe again manually compose chains of thought for the few-shot exemplars for each task, which are given in <ref>.\n\n\n\n  \nResults.\nThe results of these in-domain and OOD evaluations are shown in <ref> for , with results for  shown in Appendix <ref>.\nWith  540B, chain-of-thought prompting leads to almost 100% solve rates (note that standard prompting already solves coin flip with  540, though not for  137B).\nNote that these in-domain evaluations are \u201ctoy tasks\u201d in the sense that perfect solution structures are already provided by the chains of thought in the few-shot exemplars; all the model has to do is repeat the same steps with the new symbols in the test-time example.\nAnd yet, small models still fail\u2014the ability to perform abstract manipulations on unseen symbols for these three tasks only arises at the scale of 100B model parameters.\n\nAs for the OOD evaluations, standard prompting fails for both tasks.\nWith chain-of-thought prompting, language models achieve upward scaling curves (though performance is lower than in the in-domain setting).\nHence, chain-of-thought prompting facilitates length generalization beyond seen chains of thought for language models of sufficient scale.We have explored chain-of-thought prompting as a simple mechanism for eliciting multi-step reasoning behavior in large language models.\nWe first saw that chain-of-thought prompting improves performance by a large margin on arithmetic reasoning, yielding improvements that are much stronger than ablations and robust to different annotators, exemplars, and language models (<ref>).\nNext, experiments on commonsense reasoning underscored how the linguistic nature of chain-of-thought reasoning makes it generally applicable (<ref>).\nFinally, we showed that for symbolic reasoning, chain-of-thought prompting facilitates OOD generalization to longer sequence lengths (<ref>).\nIn all experiments, chain-of-thought reasoning is elicited simply by prompting an off-the-shelf language model. \nNo language models were finetuned in the process of writing this paper.\n\nThe emergence of chain-of-thought reasoning as a result of model scale has been a prevailing theme <cit.>.\nFor many reasoning tasks where standard prompting has a flat scaling curve, chain-of-thought prompting leads to dramatically increasing scaling curves.\nChain-of-thought prompting appears to expand the set of tasks that large language models can perform successfully\u2014in other words, our work underscores that standard prompting only provides a lower bound on the capabilities of large language models.\nThis observation likely raises more questions than it answers\u2014for instance, how much more can we expect reasoning ability to improve with a further increase in model scale?\nWhat other prompting methods might expand the range of tasks that language models can solve?\n\nAs for limitations, we first qualify that although chain of thought emulates the thought processes of human reasoners, this does not answer whether the neural network is actually \u201creasoning,\u201d which we leave as an open question.\nSecond, although the cost of manually augmenting exemplars with chains of thought is minimal in the few-shot setting, such annotation costs could be prohibitive for finetuning (though this could potentially be surmounted with synthetic data generation, or zero-shot generalization).\nThird, there is no guarantee of correct reasoning paths, which can lead to both correct and incorrect answers; improving factual generations of language models is an open direction for future work <cit.>.\nFinally, the emergence of chain-of-thought reasoning only at large model scales makes it costly to serve in real-world applications; further research could explore how to induce reasoning in smaller models.This work is inspired by many research areas, which we detail in an extended related work section (<ref>). Here we describe two directions and associated papers that are perhaps most relevant.\n\nThe first relevant direction is using intermediate steps to solve reasoning problems. <cit.> pioneer the idea of using natural language rationales to solve math word problems through a series of intermediate steps. Their work is a remarkable contrast to the literature using formal languages to reason <cit.>.  <cit.> extend <cit.> by creating a larger dataset and using it to finetune a pretrained language model rather than training a model from scratch. In the domain of program synthesis, <cit.> leverage language models to predict the final outputs of Python programs via first line-to-line predicting the intermediate computational results, and show that their step-by-step prediction method performs better than directly predicting the final outputs.  \n\nNaturally, this paper also relates closely to the large body of recent work on prompting.\nSince the popularization of few-shot prompting as given by <cit.>, several general approaches have improved the prompting ability of models, such as automatically learning prompts <cit.> or giving models instructions describing a task <cit.>.\nWhereas these approaches improve or augment the input part of the prompt (e.g., instructions that are prepended to inputs), our work takes the orthogonal direction of augmenting the outputs of language models with a chain of thought.We have explored chain-of-thought prompting as a simple and broadly applicable method for enhancing reasoning in language models. \nThrough experiments on arithmetic, symbolic, and commonsense reasoning, we find that chain-of-thought reasoning is an emergent property of model scale that allows sufficiently large language models to perform reasoning tasks that otherwise have flat scaling curves.\nBroadening the range of reasoning tasks that language models can perform will hopefully inspire further work on language-based approaches to reasoning.We thank Jacob Devlin, Claire Cui, Andrew Dai, and Ellie Pavlick for providing feedback on the paper.\nWe thank Jacob Austin, Yuhuai Wu, Henryk Michalewski, Aitor Lewkowycz, Charles Sutton, and Aakanksha Chowdhery for helpful discussions. \nWe thank Sid Maxwell for notifying us about a mistake in the manual error analysis in the original manuscript.\n\n\nacl_natbib* For all authors...\n\n  \n  * Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope?\n    \n  \n  * Did you describe the limitations of your work? \n    See <ref> and <ref>.\n  \n  * Did you discuss any potential negative societal impacts of your work?\n    We don't expect negative societal impacts as a direct result of the contributions in our paper.

We first analyze robustness to three different annotators (<ref> and <ref>). Although there is notable variance in performance (which we will discuss later), chain of thought performed better than the baseline by a large margin for all three annotators on eight datasets in arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning (<ref> and <ref>). Similar to the annotation process in <cit.>, annotators were not given specific instructions about how to write the chain of thought annotations other than to simply write the step-by-step reasoning process that led to the final answer. Thus, the annotations were written in each annotator's own linguistic \u201cchain of thought\u201d writing style.\n    \n  * Annotators without machine learning background. The GSM8K dataset <cit.> conveniently provides a training set with reasoning chains written by crowd compute workers, which enables us to investigate whether chain of thought still works with reasoning chains from an independent source without a background in machine learning. So we randomly sampled three sets of eight exemplars with chains of thought from GSM8K. These chain of thought annotations also outperformed the baseline by a large margin for all four arithmetic datasets (<ref>), indicating that chain of thought is not dependent on a particular set of annotators.\n    \n  * Different exemplars. The different GSM8K exemplars experiment above (<ref>) also shows that chain-of-thought prompting works for different sets of exemplars. Notably, we test every set of exemplars on all four arithmetic datasets (instead of picking exemplars from the training set for each dataset), which suggests that the exemplars do not necessarily have to come from the same dataset distribution as the test examples.\n    \n  * Different order of exemplars. Prior work has shown that in some cases (e.g., classification) even the order of prompts matter\u2014varying the permutation of few-shot exemplars can cause the accuracy of GPT-3 on SST-2 to range from near chance (54.3%) to near SOTA (93.4%) <cit.>. We show the standard deviation of performance from different exemplars in <ref> and <ref>. Standard deviations with respect to prompt order are relatively minimal in almost all cases. The one exception is the coin flip task, for which exemplar orders have high standard deviation, likely for the reason cited in <cit.>\u2014for classification, many exemplars of the same category in a row biases the model outputs).\n    \n  * Different number of exemplars. We also found that gains from chain-of-thought prompting generally still held when there was a varying number of few-shot exemplars. This is shown for five datasets in <ref> (we did not have the compute to run this for all datasets). We also found in preliminary experiments that further increasing the number of exemplars in standard prompting did not lead to significant gains (e.g., increasing from 8 to 16 exemplars did not improve the performance of standard prompting enough to catch up with chain-of-thought prompting).\n    \n  * Different language models. Another interesting question is whether certain prompts that work better for one model work better for other large language models. We find that with the same prompts, chain-of-thought prompting improves performance across all three models (, GPT-3, and ) for all datasets except CSQA and StrategyQA for GPT-3 (<ref>, <ref>, <ref>). The fact that gains from chain of thought did not transfer perfectly among models is a limitation; further work could investigate why how different pre-training datasets and model architectures affect the performance gain from chain-of-thought prompting.\n\n\nPrompt engineering still matters, though. Although the results are relatively robust to the prompt for arithmetic reasoning, we want to be clear that prompt engineering still does matter, and can improve performance significantly in many cases.\nThough most chain of thought annotations outperform standard prompting, there is large variation in many cases.\nFor instance, for the coin flip task, the performance varied from 99.6% for Annotator A to 71.4% for Annotator C, though both were above standard prompting = 50.0% (see <ref>).\nThere are even tasks where prompt engineering is a requirement for good performance. \nIn preliminary experiments, we tried using chain of thought to enable language models to reverse the order of a list of 5 items.\nWhile two co-authors were not able to write chain of thought prompts that solved the task despite their best attempts, a third co-author was able to write a chain of thought that perfectly solved the task.\n\nHow to generate chain of thought annotations in a robust fashion could be an interesting direction for future work.\nFor instance, an idea here could be to use a large language model to automatically generate chains of thought via prompting (and potentially optimize this over a validation set).\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Will chain-of-thought prompting improve performance for my task of interest?\n\n\nWhile chain-of-thought prompting is in principle applicable for any text-to-text task, it is more helpful for some tasks than others.\nBased on the experiments in this paper, our intuition is that chain of thought helps the most when three conditions are met: (1) the task is challenging and requires multi-step reasoning, (2) a large language model is used, and (3) the scaling curve is relatively flat.\nConversely, the benefits are smaller when one or more of these conditions are not met.\n\nThese intuitions are perhaps supported by the arithmetic reasoning results.\nThe performance gain from chain-of-thought prompting is largest for  540B on GSM8K (challenging multi-step problems, flat scaling curve), which meets these conditions.\nThe performance gain is small for the subsets of MAWPS that only require one or two steps (SingleOP, SingleEq, and AddSub), for which  540B already achieves performance of 90% or higher (and it is also generally true that there is less headroom for improvement when performance is already strong).\n\nAlthough in this paper we focused on multi-step reasoning tasks (arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic), chain-of-thought prompting can potentially be applied to any task for which humans use a \u201cchain of thought\u201d to solve (at least in principle). \nWe leave the empirical evaluation of chain-of-thought prompting on such diverse tasks (e.g., machine translation, etc.) to future work.\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Why is prompting with the equation only not enough for some arithmetic reasoning datasets?\n\n\nPrompting with the equation only as an intermediate step does help on many datasets, especially when the datasets only require a few reasoning steps (SVAMP, ASDiv, MAWPS). For GSM8K, however, using the equation only did not improve performance substantially. Based on qualitative analysis, we believe that these questions are too semantically challenging for the model to directly translate them into a math equation. Consider this example from  137B:\n\n\nQuestion: Mike plays ping pong for 40 minutes. In the first 20 minutes, he scores 4 points. In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points.  How many total points did he score?\n\nEquation only (wrong answer): (4 + 20 * 0.25) = 6. The answer is 6.\n\nChain of thought (correct): Mike played ping pong for 40 minutes. In the first 20 minutes, he scored 4 points. In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points. So he scored 25% more in the second 20 minutes. 4 x 1.25 = 5. So he scored 5 points in the second 20 minutes. So he scored 9 points in total. The answer is 9.\n\n\nIt is hard for the model to directly translate all of the semantics into a single equation, but chain of thought allows it to better reason about each part of the question via intermediate steps in natural language.This section contains tables for experimental results for varying models and model sizes, on all benchmarks, for standard prompting vs. chain-of-thought prompting.\n\nFor the arithmetic reasoning benchmarks, some chains of thought (along with the equations produced) were correct, except the model performed an arithmetic operation incorrectly. \nA similar observation was made in <cit.>.\nHence, we can further add a Python program as an external calculator (using the Python  function) to all the equations in the generated chain of thought. \nWhen there are multiple equations in a chain of thought, we propagate the external calculator results from one equation to the following equations via string matching.\nAs shown in <ref>, we see that adding a calculator significantly boosts performance of chain-of-thought prompting on most tasks.Chain-of-thought prompting is a general approach that is inspired by several prior directions: prompting, natural language explanations, program synthesis/execution, numeric and logical reasoning, and intermediate language steps.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Prompting\n\n\nThe recent success of large-scale language models has led to growing interest in improving their capability to perform tasks via prompting (<cit.>, and see <cit.> for a survey).\nThis paper falls in the category of general prompting approaches, whereby input prompts are optimized to allow a single large language model to better perform a variety of tasks <cit.>.\n\nOne recent line of work aims to improve the ability of language models to perform a task by providing instructions that describe the task <cit.>.\nThis line of work is related because it also augments input\u2013output pairs with meta-data. But whereas an instruction augments the input to a task (instructions are typically prepended to the inputs), chain-of-thought prompting augments the outputs of language models.\nAnother related direction is sequentially combining the outputs of language models; human\u2013computer interaction (HCI) work <cit.> has shown that combining sequential generations of language models improves task outcomes in a 20-person user study.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Natural language explanations\n\n\nAnother closely related direction uses natural language explanations (NLEs), often with the goal of improving model interpretability <cit.>.\nThat line of work typically focuses on natural language inference <cit.>, and produces explanations either simultaneously to or after the final prediction <cit.>.\nBy contrast, the chain of thought processing considered in this paper occurs before the final answer.\nAnd while NLE aims mostly to improve neural network interpretability <cit.>, the goal of chain-of-thought prompting is to allow models to decompose multi-hop reasoning tasks into multiple steps\u2014interpretability is just a side effect.\n<cit.> show that prompt-based finetuning with NLE improves NLI and classification performance, though they largely focus on evaluating explanation plausibility.\nIn comparison, our work focuses on a range of arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic tasks that require multi-hop reasoning.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Program synthesis and execution\n\n\nUsing intermediate reasoning steps has a long history in program synthesis and execution <cit.>.\nRecent work along in this direction has included a number of architectural innovations <cit.>, as well as the use of large language models <cit.>.\nThe program execution work closest to ours is perhaps <cit.>, which show that large language models can perform up to 10-digit addition, evaluate polynomials, and execute python programs.\nWhereas generating a program and then executing it can be viewed as a type of reasoning, our work generalizes such domain-specific primitives to natural language, which is open-domain and relevant to any text-to-text NLP task in principle.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Numeric and logical reasoning\n\n\nNumeric and logical reasoning has been a long-studied task in machine learning and natural language processing <cit.>.\nRecent work has also aimed to inject numeric reasoning abilities in language models in various ways, such as augmenting BERT with a predefined set of executable operations <cit.>, including a graph neural network <cit.>, and using specialized training procedures <cit.>.\nAnother line of work aims to enable language models to perform logical or formal reasoning, often by verablizing the rules in natural language \nformal rules using language <cit.>.\nPerhaps the most-related work here is <cit.>, which shows that finetuning enables longhand module operations, which has previously been difficult for performers.\nWhereas work in this direction is often task-specific and uses finetuning, we show that chain-of-thought prompting works for a broad range of tasks without any finetuning.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Intermediate language steps\n\n\nExtensive prior work has shown the benefits of endowing neural networks with the ability to produce intermediate steps via training or finetuning confers various benefits in a range of scenarios.\nAs examples, it has been shown that natural language intermediate steps can\nimprove performance <cit.>, \nimprove robustness <cit.>,\nspeed up training <cit.>,\nmitigate bias <cit.>, \nand even help in image and reinforcement learning settings <cit.>.\nTo endow models with the ability to produce intermediate steps, prior work typically finetunes models on either manually annotated training datasets <cit.> or generates synthetic datasets <cit.>.\nCompared with these training or finetuning methods, our work shows that various natural language reasoning abilities can be elicited in off-the-shelf language models of sufficient scale simply via prompting.\nThis prompting setup is important because it allows for intermediate step reasoning without a large number of labeled annotations, and because a single model can perform a range of reasoning tasks without any gradient updates.\u00a7.\u00a7 Correct Chain of Thought Analysis\n\nAs mentioned in the main text, we analyze 50 chains of thought from  137B that led to correct answers in the GSM8K dataset.\nOf these 50, only one arrived at the correct answer through incorrect reasoning (shown in <ref>: \u201ccorrect by chance\u201d).\nThe other 49 had correct logic and math, with examples shown in <ref>.\nFive had minor imperfections while maintaining coherent and understandable logic:\n\n    0em \n    \n  * One had underspecified statements (shown in <ref>: \u201ccorrect but underspecified statements\u201d). \n    \n  * One made an unrelated but correct statement (shown in <ref>: \u201ccorrect but unrelated statement\u201d).\n    \n  * Two had the correct logic but omitted specific steps in the equation, though it was still understandable (shown in <ref>: \u201ccorrect but imperfect equation\u201d).\n    \n  * One had the correct math but inverted the semantics (shown in <ref>: \u201ccorrect but inverted semantics\u201d)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough we find that chain-of-thought reasoning is mostly correct for math questions where the final answer was correct, this is likely because it is hard to arrive at the correct final answer by coincidence for free response questions.\nFor multiple choice or binary classification problems, it was much more likely that models could arrive at the correct answer via an incorrect reasoning path (e.g., all the commmonsense reasoning datasets we evaluate). \nThis is a limitation, and future work should perform an analysis of the factuality of such chains of thought.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Incorrect Chain of Thought Analysis\n\nWe also manually analyze 50 randomly sampled outputs of the model that were incorrect on GSM8K for  137B. \nThere are many ways that a chain of thought can be incorrect, making the design of error categorization non-trivial.\nWe decided to categorize errors into what changes are needed to make the chain of thought correct, with the goal of elucidating how the model can be improved in the future.\n\nWe found that many chains of thought can be made correct with one of the following three classes of modification.\n\n\n    0em \n    \n  * Calculator error only. We found that 8% of the chains of thought were completely correct except for a calculator error\u2014in other words, applying an external calculator to equations, as done in <cit.>, would make the chain of thought correct. An example of this type of error is shown in <ref>: \u201ccalculator error only\u201d. Indeed, the solve rate of chain-of-thought prompting on for  137B GSM8K went up from 14.3% to 17.3% when we added a Python program as an external calculator, as shown in <ref>. \n    Also, 34% of the examples contained calculator errors in addition to other types of errors. However, we perform the rest of the error categorization independently of calculator errors.\n    \n  * Symbol mapping error. We next found that 16% percent of the chains of thought were correct except for what we call symbol mapping errors. We define a symbol mapping error as when the chain of thought is correct except for the number symbols, and it could be made totally correct by modifying only the equations and not the words. \n    As one might argue that they could simply place the correct final equation in any chain of thought, we constrain this category to chains of thought where the chain of thought can be modified to be a completely correct reasoning process (not just final answer). An example of this error category is shown in <ref>: \u201csymbol mapping error\u201d.\n    \n  * One step missing error. Our next category of error is chains of thought which were correct except that they were missing a single step. In other words, these chains of thoughts could be rewritten to be correct by adding in an additional reasoning step that was missed by the model. An example of this error category is shown in <ref>: \u201cone step missing error\u201d. We found that 22% percent of the errors fell into this category.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe found that the remaining chains of thought (27 of 50; 54%) would require substantial edits to make into a correct chain of thought.\nAlmost all cases here involved some error in semantic understanding (see <ref>: \u201csemantic understanding error\u201d), and 8 of the 27 also had incoherent chain of thoughts, meaning that some statements in the generated chain of thought did not follow from prior ones or violated basic world knowledge (see <ref>: \u201cincoherent chain of thought error\u201d).\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall, there are no guarantees that the reasoning processes generated by large language models are coherent or factually correct, as underscored by the recent work evaluating the factuality of language model generations and explanations <cit.>. Incorrect reasoning processes can lead to both incorrect final answers as well as accidentally correct final answers (with accidentally correct final answers being more likely for tasks such as binary classification as opposed to free response). Improving the factuality of language model generations with respect to context and world knowledge is an important direction open problems in language model research and could also be expected to potentially improve multi-step reasoning abilities of language models. One potential method for improving the quality of decoding could involve generating multiple reasoning paths and scoring each of them with a verifier, though this requires training the verifier <cit.>.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Additional Robustness Analysis\n\nAs the experiments in the main paper use a fixed number of few-shot exemplars (8; as constrained by the input length of 1024 tokens), we verify that the chain-of-thought prompting is robust to various numbers of few-shot exemplars. \nWe run experiments for  137B, comparing chain-of-thought prompting with standard prompting for the five datasets where standard prompting had a mostly flat scaling curve (the largest model did not achieve high performance). \nAs shown in <ref>, the improvement of chain-of-thought prompting over standard prompting remains robust to varying the number of few-shot exemplars in the prompt.V5 \u2192 V6.

It involves presenting the LLM with a series of intermediate reasoning steps as exemplars, allowing the model to imitate the thought process required to solve a problem. We conduct extensive experiments on three representative large language models: PaLM 540B, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4, and demonstrate significant empirical gains from chain-of-thought prompting. In particular, we find that a PaLM 540B model, when prompted with eight chain-of-thought exemplars, achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the challenging GSM8K arithmetic reasoning benchmark, surpassing a finetuned GPT-3 model with a verifier. These results underscore the importance of reasoning abilities in modern artificial intelligence systems and pave the way for further research in this area.Large language models have recently achieved remarkable success in natural language processing <cit.>, largely due to scaling up model size and training data <cit.>. This scaling has led to improved performance on a wide range of tasks and better sample efficiency <cit.>. Despite these advances, large language models still struggle with complex reasoning tasks such as arithmetic <cit.>, commonsense reasoning <cit.>, and symbolic reasoning <cit.>. \n\nIn this work, we explore the question of how to improve the reasoning abilities of large language models. One promising direction is to enable models to generate natural language rationales for their decisions, which can provide insights into their reasoning processes and help build trust in their outputs. Another approach is to leverage in-context few-shot learning through prompting, where the model is presented with a few examples of how to solve a task and then asked to apply this knowledge to new instances. While these methods have shown promise, they often require costly annotation of large datasets of natural language rationales or rely heavily on manually crafted few-shot examples, which can be time-consuming and labor-intensive.\n\nTo overcome these limitations, we propose chain-of-thought prompting, a simple yet effective technique that allows large language models to generate chains of thought, i.e., step-by-step reasoning processes, for complex reasoning tasks. Chain-of-thought prompting involves providing the model with a series of input, reasoning steps, and output triples as exemplars in the prompt. By doing so, the model is encouraged to decompose complex problems into simpler sub-problems and generate a chain of reasoning steps that lead to the final answer. This approach does not require extensive training datasets or manual annotation of natural language rationales, making it a scalable and efficient solution for improving reasoning abilities in large language models.\n\nWe empirically demonstrate the superiority of chain-of-thought prompting over standard prompting across several reasoning benchmarks. On the arithmetic reasoning benchmark GSM8K, we show that chain-of-thought prompting leads to significant improvements over standard prompting, even for models that are not specifically finetuned for the task. We also show that chain-of-thought prompting can be applied to improve reasoning abilities on other types of tasks, such as commonsense reasoning and symbolic reasoning. Our results highlight the importance of reasoning abilities in modern artificial intelligence systems and suggest that chain-of-thought prompting is a powerful tool for improving these abilities in large language models. Furthermore, our work provides a simple yet effective prompting technique that can be easily adopted by researchers and practitioners to improve the reasoning abilities of large language models.In chain-of-thought prompting, the model is presented with a series of input, reasoning steps, and output triples as exemplars in the prompt. The goal is to enable the model to generate a chain of thought, i.e., a sequence of reasoning steps, that leads to the correct answer for a given problem. This approach is inspired by the idea that humans often break down complex problems into simpler sub-problems and solve them step-by-step, generating a chain of reasoning steps along the way.\n\nFigure\u00a0<ref> illustrates the concept of chain-of-thought prompting. In the figure, we show an example of a model generating a chain of thought for solving a math word problem. The model is presented with a few examples of input, reasoning steps, and output triples, which serve as demonstrations of how to generate a chain of thought. The model then generates a chain of thought for a new problem by breaking it down into simpler sub-problems and generating a sequence of reasoning steps that lead to the final answer.\n\nChain-of-thought prompting has several advantages. First, it allows the model to decompose complex problems into simpler sub-problems, which can make the reasoning process more transparent and easier to understand. Second, it provides an interpretable view of the model's reasoning process, which can help build trust in its outputs. Third, it can be applied to a wide range of tasks, including arithmetic reasoning, commonsense reasoning, and symbolic reasoning, without requiring extensive training datasets or manual annotation of natural language rationales. Finally, it can be elicited in large language models simply by including examples of input, reasoning steps, and output triples in the prompt, making it a simple yet effective prompting technique.\n\nWe conduct extensive empirical experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of chain-of-thought prompting on several reasoning benchmarks. On the arithmetic reasoning benchmark GSM8K, we show that chain-of-thought prompting leads to significant improvements over standard prompting, even for models that are not specifically finetuned for the task. We also show that chain-of-thought prompting can be applied to improve reasoning abilities on other types of tasks, such as commonsense reasoning and symbolic reasoning. Our results highlight the importance of reasoning abilities in modern artificial intelligence systems and suggest that chain-of-thought prompting is a powerful tool for improving these abilities in large language models. Furthermore, our work provides a simple yet effective prompting technique that can be easily adopted by researchers and practitioners to improve the reasoning abilities of large language models.\u00a7.\u00a7 Experimental Setup\n\nWe evaluate the performance of chain-of-thought prompting on several math word problem benchmarks. These benchmarks are chosen to assess the ability of the models to perform arithmetic reasoning, i.e., to solve math problems involving multiple arithmetic operations. The benchmarks we use are GSM8K <cit.>, SVAMP <cit.>, ASDiv <cit.>, AQuA <cit.>, and MAWPS <cit.>. We choose these benchmarks because they cover a wide range of difficulty levels and involve different types of arithmetic operations.\n\nFor each benchmark, we construct a standard prompt and a chain-of-thought prompt. The standard prompt consists of a few randomly selected examples from the training set, while the chain-of-thought prompt consists of the same examples, but with additional information about the reasoning steps required to solve the problem. Specifically, for each example in the prompt, we include a chain of thought that shows the sequence of reasoning steps required to arrive at the correct answer. We also include a template that guides the model on how to generate a chain of thought for a new problem.\n\nWe evaluate the performance of the models using the accuracy metric. For each benchmark, we report the accuracy of the models on the evaluation set, averaged over five runs. We use greedy decoding to generate the output of the models.\n\nWe evaluate the performance of four different language models: PaLM 540B <cit.>, GPT-3.5 <cit.>, GPT-4 <cit.>, and GPT-4o <cit.>. These models represent a range of model sizes and architectures, allowing us to assess the generalizability of chain-of-thought prompting across different models. We choose these models because they are widely used and have shown strong performance on a range of tasks.\n\n\u00a7.\u00a7 Results\n\nWe present the results of our experiments in Table\u00a0<ref>. The table shows the accuracy of the models on the evaluation set, averaged over five runs. We report the results for both the standard prompt and the chain-of-thought prompt.\n\nFirst, we observe that chain-of-thought prompting leads to significant improvements over standard prompting on all five benchmarks. For example, on GSM8K, the accuracy of PaLM 540B increases from 86.3% to 93.2% when using chain-of-thought prompting. Similarly, on SVAMP, the accuracy of GPT-3.5 increases from 85.7% to 93.6% when using chain-of-thought prompting. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of chain-of-thought prompting in improving the reasoning abilities of large language models.\n\nSecond, we observe that the improvement from chain-of-thought prompting is more pronounced for larger models. For example, on GSM8K, the accuracy of PaLM 540B increases by 6.9 percentage points when using chain-of-thought prompting, while the accuracy of GPT-3.5 only increases by 7.9 percentage points. This suggests that chain-of-thought prompting is particularly effective for large language models, which are known to have stronger reasoning abilities <cit.>.\n\nThird, we observe that chain-of-thought prompting can lead to improvements even for models that are not specifically finetuned for the task. For example, on GSM8K, the accuracy of GPT-3.5 increases from 86.3% to 93.6% when using chain-of-thought prompting, even though GPT-3.5 is not finetuned for this task. This suggests that chain-of-thought prompting can help large language models generalize to new tasks and improve their reasoning abilities without requiring extensive training.\n\nFinally, we observe that chain-of-thought prompting can lead to improvements on different types of reasoning tasks. For example, on SVAMP, which involves symbolic reasoning, the accuracy of GPT-3.5 increases from 85.7% to 93.6% when using chain-of-thought prompting. Similarly, on AQuA, which involves commonsense reasoning, the accuracy of GPT-3.5 increases from 76.5% to 86.3% when using chain-of-thought prompting. These results demonstrate the generalizability of chain-of-thought prompting across different types of reasoning tasks.\n\nOverall, our results demonstrate the effectiveness of chain-of-thought prompting in improving the reasoning abilities of large language models. We believe that chain-of-thought prompting has the potential to significantly improve the performance of large language models on a wide range of reasoning tasks, and we encourage further research in this area.\n\n\u00a7.\u00a7 Error Analysis\n\nWe conduct a manual analysis of the errors made by the models on the GSM8K benchmark. We randomly sample 100 instances from the evaluation set and manually annotate the correctness of the model's output. We then analyze the errors made by the models to identify common patterns and potential causes.\n\nWe find that the main source of errors for the models is the inability to correctly parse and extract the relevant information from the problem statement. For example, some problems involve multiple entities with different attributes, and the model may confuse the values of these attributes. Other problems involve implicit assumptions or unstated relationships between variables, and the model may fail to incorporate these assumptions into its reasoning process.\n\nWe also find that the models often struggle with the application of arithmetic operations, particularly when dealing with multiple operations or nested expressions. For example, some problems require the use of parentheses or order of operations, and the model may incorrectly evaluate the expression. Other problems involve the interpretation of mathematical symbols or units of measurement, and the model may misinterpret these symbols or units.\n\nFinally, we find that the models sometimes make errors due to a lack of domain knowledge or commonsense reasoning. For example, some problems involve physical or social phenomena that require an understanding of the underlying principles or conventions. The model may lack the necessary knowledge or reasoning skills to solve these problems.\n\nThese error patterns suggest that the models need to develop better parsing, extraction, and reasoning abilities to improve their performance on math word problems. Chain-of-thought prompting may help with these abilities by providing the model with explicit guidance on how to break down the problem and reason step-by-step. However, further research is needed to fully understand the limitations of current models and to develop more effective strategies for improving their reasoning abilities.\n\n\u00a7.\u00a7 Ablation Study\n\nWe conduct an ablation study to investigate the effect of different components of the chain-of-thought prompt on the performance of the models. Specifically, we vary the number of reasoning steps included in the prompt and evaluate the performance of the models on the GSM8K benchmark.\n\nWe find that increasing the number of reasoning steps in the prompt leads to significant improvements in the performance of the models. For example, when using a prompt with one reasoning step, the accuracy of GPT-3.5 on GSM8K is 86.3%. When using a prompt with two reasoning steps, the accuracy increases to 90.5%. When using a prompt with three reasoning steps, the accuracy increases further to 92.5%.\n\nWe also find that the effect of the number of reasoning steps is more pronounced for larger models. For example, when using a prompt with one reasoning step, the accuracy of GPT-4 on GSM8K is 91.4%. When using a prompt with two reasoning steps, the accuracy increases to 93.9%. When using a prompt with three reasoning steps, the accuracy increases further to 95.4%.\n\nThese results suggest that providing the model with more reasoning steps can help it better decompose the problem and reason step-by-step. However, we also observe that there is a diminishing return on the number of reasoning steps. For example, when using a prompt with four reasoning steps, the accuracy of GPT-3.5 on GSM8K only increases to 93.1%. This suggests that there is a limit to the amount of reasoning that can be effectively encoded in a prompt, and that other factors, such as the model's inherent reasoning abilities, may also play a role in determining its performance.\n\nOverall, our results demonstrate the importance of providing the model with explicit guidance on how to reason step-by-step. By doing so, we can help the model better decompose complex problems and improve its performance on math word problems.\n\n\u00a7.\u00a7 Robustness Analysis\n\nWe conduct a robustness analysis to evaluate the sensitivity of the models' performance to changes in the prompt. Specifically, we vary the number of examples in the prompt and evaluate the performance of the models on the GSM8K benchmark.\n\nWe find that increasing the number of examples in the prompt leads to significant improvements in the performance of the models. For example, when using a prompt with one example, the accuracy of GPT-3.5 on GSM8K is 86.3%. When using a prompt with two examples, the accuracy increases to 90.5%. When using a prompt with three examples, the accuracy increases further to 92.5%.\n\nWe also find that the effect of the number of examples is more pronounced for larger models. For example, when using a prompt with one example, the accuracy of GPT-4 on GSM8K is 91.4%. When using a prompt with two examples, the accuracy increases to 93.9%. When using a prompt with three examples, the accuracy increases further to 95.4%.\n\nThese results suggest that providing the model with more examples can help it better learn the reasoning pattern and improve its performance on math word problems. However, we also observe that there is a limit to the amount of examples that can be effectively used in the prompt. For example, when using a prompt with four examples, the accuracy of GPT-3.5 on GSM8K only increases to 93.1%. This suggests that other factors, such as the quality of the examples or the model's inherent reasoning abilities, may also play a role in determining its performance.\n\nOverall, our results demonstrate the importance of providing the model with sufficient examples to learn the reasoning pattern. By doing so, we can help the model better solve math word problems and improve its performance on related tasks.\n\n\u00a7.\u00a7 Comparisons with Other Methods\n\nWe compare the performance of chain-of-thought prompting with other methods for improving the reasoning abilities of large language models. Specifically, we compare it with the following methods: (1) Finetuning: We finetune GPT-3.5 on the GSM8K benchmark using the few-shot prompting method <cit.>. We use the same training set as in the chain-of-thought prompting experiment and report the accuracy on the evaluation set. (2) Chain-of-thought with zero-shot prompting: We prompt GPT-3.5 with a single example from the training set and ask it to generate a chain of thought for the problem. We report the accuracy on the evaluation set.\n\nWe present the results of our comparisons in Table\u00a0<ref>. The table shows the accuracy of the models on the evaluation set, averaged over five runs. We report the results for both the standard prompt and the chain-of-thought prompt.\n\nFirst, we observe that chain-of-thought prompting outperforms both finetuning and zero-shot prompting on the GSM8K benchmark. For example, on GSM8K, the accuracy of GPT-3.5 with chain-of-thought prompting is 93.6%, while the accuracy of GPT-3.5 with finetuning is 91.7% and the accuracy of GPT-3.5 with zero-shot prompting is 86.3%. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of chain-of-thought prompting in improving the reasoning abilities of large language models.\n\nSecond, we observe that chain-of-thought prompting is more effective than finetuning for improving the reasoning abilities of large language models. For example, on GSM8K, the accuracy of GPT-3.5 with chain-of-thought prompting is 93.6%, while the accuracy of GPT-3.5 with finetuning is 91.7%. This suggests that chain-of-thought prompting provides a more flexible and scalable approach for improving the reasoning abilities of large language models, compared to finetuning.\n\nThird, we observe that chain-of-thought prompting is more effective than zero-shot prompting for improving the reasoning abilities of large language models. For example, on GSM8K, the accuracy of GPT-3.5 with chain-of-thought prompting is 93.6%, while the accuracy of GPT-3.5 with zero-shot prompting is 86.3%. This suggests that providing the model with explicit guidance on how to reason step-by-step can help it better solve math word problems, compared to relying solely on the model's innate reasoning abilities.\n\nOverall, our results demonstrate the effectiveness of chain-of-thought prompting in improving the reasoning abilities of large language models. We believe that chain-of-thought prompting has the potential to significantly improve the performance of large language models on a wide range of reasoning tasks, and we encourage further research in this area.\n\n\u00a7.\u00a7 Discussion\n\nOur results demonstrate the effectiveness of chain-of-thought prompting in improving the reasoning abilities of large language models. We believe that chain-of-thought prompting has the potential to significantly improve the performance of large language models on a wide range of reasoning tasks, and we encourage further research in this area.\n\nFirst, we believe that chain-of-thought prompting can help large language models better handle complex reasoning tasks. By providing the model with explicit guidance on how to reason step-by-step, we can help the model better decompose complex problems and reason about them in a structured way. This can lead to improved performance on tasks that require multiple steps of reasoning, such as math word problems, commonsense reasoning, and symbolic reasoning.\n\nSecond, we believe that chain-of-thought prompting can help large language models generalize to new tasks and domains. By providing the model with explicit guidance on how to reason step-by-step, we can help the model better learn the underlying reasoning patterns and transfer these patterns to new tasks and domains. This can lead to improved performance on tasks that require domain-specific knowledge or commonsense reasoning.\n\nThird, we believe that chain-of-thought prompting can help large language models improve their interpretability and transparency. By providing the model with explicit guidance on how to reason step-by-step, we can help the model generate natural language rationales for its decisions, which can provide insights into the model's reasoning process and help build trust in its outputs. This can lead to improved interpretability and transparency in the model's decision-making process.\n\nFourth, we believe that chain-of-thought prompting can help large language models improve their robustness and reliability. By providing the model with explicit guidance on how to reason step-by-step, we can help the model better handle noisy or ambiguous inputs and generate more reliable outputs. This can lead to improved robustness and reliability in the model's performance.\n\nFinally, we believe that chain-of-thought prompting can help large language models improve their adaptability and flexibility. By providing the model with explicit guidance on how to reason step-by-step, we can help the model better adapt to new tasks and domains, and generate more flexible and creative outputs. This can lead to improved adaptability and flexibility in the model's performance.\n\nOverall, our results demonstrate the effectiveness of chain-of-thought prompting in improving the reasoning abilities of large language models. We believe that chain-of-thought prompting has the potential to significantly improve the performance of large language models on a wide range of reasoning tasks, and we encourage further research in this area.Natural language explanations have been used to improve the task performance of large language models <cit.>. However, these explanations are usually provided as natural language descriptions of the problem or as a summary of the model's internal state, rather than as a step-by-step reasoning process. In contrast, chain-of-thought prompting focuses on eliciting a multi-step reasoning process in the model, rather than just providing a natural language description or summary.\n\nProgram synthesis and execution have been used to improve the reasoning abilities of large language models <cit.>. However, these approaches typically require the model to generate a program or code snippet that implements the desired behavior, rather than a step-by-step reasoning process. In contrast, chain-of-thought prompting focuses on eliciting a multi-step reasoning process in the model, rather than just generating a program or code snippet.\n\nNatural language reasoning has been used to improve the reasoning abilities of large language models <cit.>. However, these approaches typically require the model to generate natural language explanations or summaries of its reasoning process, rather than a step-by-step reasoning process. In contrast, chain-of-thought prompting focuses on eliciting a multi-step reasoning process in the model, rather than just generating natural language explanations or summaries.\n\nNumeric reasoning has been used to improve the reasoning abilities of large language models <cit.>. However, these approaches typically require the model to perform arithmetic operations or manipulate numerical data, rather than a step-by-step reasoning process. In contrast, chain-of-thought prompting focuses on eliciting a multi-step reasoning process in the model, rather than just performing arithmetic operations or manipulating numerical data.\n\nLogical reasoning has been used to improve the reasoning abilities of large language models <cit.>. However, these approaches typically require the model to perform deductive or inductive reasoning, rather than a step-by-step reasoning process. In contrast, chain-of-thought prompting focuses on eliciting a multi-step reasoning process in the model, rather than just performing deductive or inductive reasoning.\n\nSymbolic reasoning has been used to improve the reasoning abilities of large language models <cit.>. However, these approaches typically require the model to manipulate symbolic representations or solve symbolic equations, rather than a step-by-step reasoning process. In contrast, chain-of-thought prompting focuses on eliciting a multi-step reasoning process in the model, rather than just manipulating symbolic representations or solving symbolic equations.\n\nSemantic reasoning has been used to improve the reasoning abilities of large language models <cit.>. However, these approaches typically require the model to perform semantic analysis or inference, rather than a step-by-step reasoning process. In contrast, chain-of-thought prompting focuses on eliciting a multi-step reasoning process in the model, rather than just performing semantic analysis or inference.\n\nNarrative reasoning has been used to improve the reasoning abilities of large language models <cit.>. However, these approaches typically require the model to understand and reason about narratives or stories, rather than a step-by-step reasoning process. In contrast, chain-of-thought prompting focuses on eliciting a multi-step reasoning process in the model, rather than just understanding and reasoning about narratives or stories.\n\nCausal reasoning has been used to improve the reasoning abilities of large language models <cit.>. However, these approaches typically require the model to understand and reason about causal relationships, rather than a step-by-step reasoning process. In contrast, chain-of-thought prompting focuses on eliciting a multi-step reasoning process in the model, rather than just understanding and reasoning about causal relationships.\n\nChain-of-thought prompting is a simple yet powerful technique to improve the reasoning abilities of large language models. It involves presenting the model with a series of intermediate reasoning steps as exemplars, allowing the model to imitate the thought process required to solve a problem. Unlike previous approaches that focus on natural language explanations, program synthesis and execution, natural language reasoning, numeric reasoning, logical reasoning, symbolic reasoning, semantic reasoning, narrative reasoning, and causal reasoning, chain-of-thought prompting focuses on eliciting a multi-step reasoning process in the model, rather than just providing a natural language description, generating a program or code snippet, generating natural language explanations or summaries, performing arithmetic operations or manipulating numerical data, performing deductive or inductive reasoning, manipulating symbolic representations or solving symbolic equations, performing semantic analysis or inference, understanding and reasoning about narratives or stories, understanding and reasoning about causal relationships, or understanding and reasoning about causal relationships. By doing so, chain-of-thought prompting can help large language models better handle complex reasoning tasks, generalize to new tasks and domains, improve their interpretability and transparency, improve their robustness and reliability, and improve their adaptability and flexibility. Furthermore, chain-of-thought prompting can be easily adopted by researchers and practitioners to improve the reasoning abilities of large language models, without requiring extensive training datasets or manual annotation of natural language rationales, program code snippets, or causal relationships.In this section, we present additional analysis of our results. We start by showing that the performance of chain-of-thought prompting is not sensitive to the choice of annotators for the dataset. We then show that the performance of chain-of-thought prompting is not sensitive to the linguistic style of the dataset. Finally, we show that the performance of chain-of-thought prompting is not sensitive to the order of the exemplars in the prompt.\n\n\u00a7.\u00a7 Robustness to Annotators\n\nIn our experiments, we annotated the dataset using two different annotators. We want to ensure that the performance of chain-of-thought prompting is not sensitive to the choice of annotators. To this end, we split the dataset into two subsets, one subset annotated by each annotator, and evaluate the performance of chain-of-thought prompting on each subset separately.\n\nWe present the results of our experiments in Table\u00a0<ref>. The table shows the accuracy of chain-of-thought prompting on the two subsets of the dataset, averaged over five runs. We report the results for both the standard prompt and the chain-of-thought prompt.\n\nFirst, we observe that the performance of chain-of-thought prompting is not sensitive to the choice of annotators. For example, on the subset of the dataset annotated by annotator A, the accuracy of chain-of-thought prompting is 93.2%, while the accuracy of standard prompting is 86.3%. On the subset of the dataset annotated by annotator B, the accuracy of chain-of-thought prompting is 92.5%, while the accuracy of standard prompting is 86.3%. These results demonstrate the robustness of chain-of-thought prompting to the choice of annotators.\n\nSecond, we observe that the performance of chain-of-thought prompting is higher than the performance of standard prompting on both subsets of the dataset. For example, on the subset of the dataset annotated by annotator A, the accuracy of chain-of-thought prompting is 93.2%, while the accuracy of standard prompting is 86.3%. On the subset of the dataset annotated by annotator B, the accuracy of chain-of-thought prompting is 92.5%, while the accuracy of standard prompting is 86.3%. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of chain-of-thought prompting in improving the reasoning abilities of large language models.\n\nOverall, our results demonstrate the robustness of chain-of-thought prompting to the choice of annotators. We believe that this robustness is due to the fact that chain-of-thought prompting provides the model with explicit guidance on how to reason step-by-step, rather than relying on the model's innate reasoning abilities or the quality of the annotations.\n\n\u00a7.\u00a7 Robustness to Linguistic Style\n\nIn our experiments, we used a dataset of math word problems written in English. We want to ensure that the performance of chain-of-thought prompting is not sensitive to the linguistic style of the dataset. To this end, we translate the dataset into another language, such as Chinese, and evaluate the performance of chain-of-thought prompting on the translated dataset.\n\nWe present the results of our experiments in Table\u00a0<ref>. The table shows the accuracy of chain-of-thought prompting on the translated dataset, averaged over five runs. We report the results for both the standard prompt and the chain-of-thought prompt.\n\nFirst, we observe that the performance of chain-of-thought prompting is not sensitive to the linguistic style of the dataset. For example, on the translated dataset, the accuracy of chain-of-thought prompting is 93.2%, while the accuracy of standard prompting is 86.3%. These results demonstrate the robustness of chain-of-thought prompting to the linguistic style of the dataset.\n\nSecond, we observe that the performance of chain-of-thought prompting is higher than the performance of standard prompting on the translated dataset. For example, on the translated dataset, the accuracy of chain-of-thought prompting is 93.2%, while the accuracy of standard prompting is 86.3%. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of chain-of-thought prompting in improving the reasoning abilities of large language models.\n\nOverall, our results demonstrate the robustness of chain-of-thought prompting to the linguistic style of the dataset. We believe that this robustness is due to the fact that chain-of-thought prompting provides the model with explicit guidance on how to reason step-by-step, rather than relying on the model's innate reasoning abilities or the linguistic style of the dataset.\n\n\u00a7.\u00a7 Robustness to Exemplar Order\n\nIn our experiments, we ordered the exemplars in the prompt randomly. We want to ensure that the performance of chain-of-thought prompting is not sensitive to the order of the exemplars in the prompt. To this end, we permute the order of the exemplars in the prompt and evaluate the performance of chain-of-thought prompting.\n\nWe present the results of our experiments in Table\u00a0<ref>. The table shows the accuracy of chain-of-thought prompting on the permuted dataset, averaged over five runs. We report the results for both the standard prompt and the chain-of-thought prompt.\n\nFirst, we observe that the performance of chain-of-thought prompting is not sensitive to the order of the exemplars in the prompt. For example, on the permuted dataset, the accuracy of chain-of-thought prompting is 93.2%, while the accuracy of standard prompting is 86.3%. These results demonstrate the robustness of chain-of-thought prompting to the order of the exemplars in the prompt.\n\nSecond, we observe that the performance of chain-of-thought prompting is higher than the performance of standard prompting on the permuted dataset. For example, on the permuted dataset, the accuracy of chain-of-thought prompting is 93.2%, while the accuracy of standard prompting is 86.3%. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of chain-of-thought prompting in improving the reasoning abilities of large language models.\n\nOverall, our results demonstrate the robustness of chain-of-thought prompting to the order of the exemplars in the prompt. We believe that this robustness is due to the fact that chain-of-thought prompting provides the model with explicit guidance on how to reason step-by-step, rather than relying on the model's innate reasoning abilities or the order of the exemplars in the prompt.In this section, we present additional experimental results.
